This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant U.S. attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr. Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr. Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DOJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators potentially that we knew nothing about that the DOJ had been investigating,\" Democrat Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed by President Trump states names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted and specifically asks the justice department for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions concerning \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Justice Department says Epstein letter to Larry Nassar is a fake</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Larry Nassar from the shoulders up, wearing square framed glasses with wire rims and orange jumpsuit, looks off to his left\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Larry Nassar</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter included in the released batch of documents got a lot of attention online. But, according to the justice department, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope at first appeared to show Epstein writing to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/clwx28lpp90t\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Larry Nassar</a>, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42811304\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">decades in prison</a> for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the faux letter states. \"We shared one thing…our love &amp; caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The writer signs it, \"Life is unfair, Yours, J. Epstein.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent back to a Manhattan jail where Epstein was detained before his death. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FBI was alerted to the returned letter and requested an analysis of it. That request was also included in the releases batch of documents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The justice department on Tuesday called the letter a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" they added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York. It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before the justice department's announcement of it being fake, the documents raised immediate questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The return sender was listed as \"J. Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was \"Metropolitan Correctional Center\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J.

Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of the trips coincide with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ghislaine-maxwell-charged-manhattan-federal-court-conspiring-jeffrey-epstein-sexually\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">years in which federal prosecutors were examining</a> Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her.

Her family said the verdict was based on extremely limited and unreliable evidence: a piece of cloth bearing the words \"Woman, Resistance, Freedom\", and an unpublished audio message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities have not yet commented on the case.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteurs on human rights in Iran, violence against women and arbitrary executions, as well as the five members of the working group on discrimination against women and girls, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/12/un-experts-urge-iran-halt-execution-67-year-old-iranian-woman\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">warned in a joint statement</a> that Ms Tabari's case showed \"a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was arrested during a raid on her home without a judicial warrant, and was interrogated for a month while held in solitary confinement and pressured to confess to taking up arms against the state and to membership in an opposition group, according to the experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tabari was denied access to a lawyer of her choosing and was represented by a court-appointed lawyer, they said, adding that her death sentence was issued immediately after a brief hearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The severe procedural violations in this case - including the unlawful deprivation of her liberty, the denial of effective legal representation, the extraordinarily brief trial, the lack of adequate time to prepare a defence, and the use of evidence that appears insufficient to support a charge of [armed rebellion] - render any resulting conviction unsafe,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also noted that international law restricted the death penalty to the most serious crimes, meaning intentional killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution,\" the experts added. \"Criminalising women's activism for gender equality and treating such expression as evidence of armed rebellion constitutes a grave form of gender discrimination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 400 prominent women - including several Nobel laureates, the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, and former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine - also signed a public appeal for Ms Tabari's immediate release on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Iran is today the world's number one executioner of women per capita. Zahra's case lays bare this terror: in Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The appeal was organised by Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, a UK-based group that represents the families of the thousands of political prisoners who were executed in Iran three decades ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Iranian woman, Kurdish rights activist and social worker Pakhshan Azizi, is also facing the death penalty on the same charge as Ms Tabari.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN experts have previously said Ms Azizi's sentencing appeared to be \"solely related to her legitimate work as a social worker, including her support for refugees in Iraq and Syria\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Iran Human Rights (IHR), at least 1,426 people - including 41 women - were executed in Iran in the first 11 months of 2025 - a 70% increase on the same period last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost half of those put to death as of the end of November were convicted of drug-related offences, while 53 were convicted of national security offences, the Norway-based group said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply,  bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could  make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

We're keeping the ships also.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil revenues to fund drug-related crime, while Caracas has condemned the seizures as \"piracy\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US military has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0mpy1ynnzzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seized two oil tankers this month</a>, including one on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump issued his latest warning as the US Coast Guard <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c99722j4lkgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">continued to pursue a third oil tanker</a>, which authorities described as part of a Venezuelan \"dark fleet\" used to evade US sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's moving along, and we'll end up getting it,\" Trump said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately on Monday, the US military said it carried out a strike on what it said was a suspected trafficking vessel in international waters in the eastern Pacific. US Southern Command said one person was killed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked whether the goal of the seizures was to force Maduro from power, Trump responded: \"Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has been building up its military presence in the Pacific and Caribbean Seas and has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats, killing around 100 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs and the military has come under increasing scrutiny from Congress over the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, Trump repeated that the US intends to strike targets on land too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said: \"We'll be starting the same programme on land. If they want to come by land, they're going to end up having a big problem. They're going to get blown to pieces, because we don't want our people poisoned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on state television, Maduro responded to Trump by saying: \"He would be better off in his own country dealing with economic and social issues and the world would be better off if he focused on his own country's affairs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to office in January, Trump has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, accusing him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has designated Maduro's government as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), and last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on oil exports to finance public spending, the latest measures have sparked outrage among officials in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what the government has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more often in recent years it was Rupert - for many decades the most influential media titan in the world - and his daughter Elisabeth who would make time for each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would certainly have room this year to host her father at the luxurious home she has renovated on the edge of the Cotswolds. But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage Rupert Murdoch (R) and daughter Elisabeth Murdoch attend the Cheltenham Festival \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'James and Rupert will never patch up differences'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable.

They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conduct operations in the Little Village neighborhood, a predominantly Mexican American community in Chicago, United States on November 08, 2025. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Chicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Picking a fight with the Pope</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US Vice President JD Vance speaks during the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast at the Walter E.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect.

Parliament in Cape Town set up its own panel to investigate the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As I see it now, this is terrorism,\" Gen Mkhwanazi said appearing as the Madlanga Commission's first witness in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are \"people who want to take over government, not through the ballot paper but through these criminal activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the three months of testimony from the parallel inquiries, South Africans have heard about an alleged drug cartel with political connections and a businessman, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, with alleged ties to leading government figures. A witness at the Madlanga Commission was also murdered after giving evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's what we've learned so far:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Role of the 'Big Five Cartel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He named two figures from the five alleged leaders of this criminal gang, one of them being controversial businessman Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala is currently facing 25 criminal charges, among them attempted murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These stem from three separate incidents that occurred between 2022 and 2024. He has denied all the charges against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crime intelligence boss claimed the Big Five led a network with widespread influence across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Big Five has already penetrated the political sphere and there are documented cases of high-profile connections in the political arena,\" the policeman alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Anonymised – and known only as \"witness C\" - he also mentioned what he called the Big Five cartel, alleging it had \"full control and oversight\" in every government department.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is 'Cat' Matlala?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gallo Images via Getty Images A composite of four head-and-shoulders photographs of Vusimusi Cat Matlala as he was giving evidence to the parliamentary inquiry showing him giving different hand gestures.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gallo Images via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala spent two days giving testimony at the parliamentary inquiry</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He shared copies of text messages and a payment allegedly made by Matlala to prove this at the time. These payments were seemingly facilitated by a third party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his appearance at the Madlanga Commission Mchunu refuted the allegations saying that he had \"never been accused of corruption, not once\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the first time I get accused of such.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2001, he was convicted and served time for the possession of stolen goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing at the parliamentary inquiry, Mr Matlala said he had turned his life around in 2017, when he \"formally registered my first business which was a security business\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he is now in custody over the attempted murder charge, he gave evidence with restraints around his ankles. Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apart from being accused of having close ties to Mchunu, Mr Matlala has been linked to others in the police force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"From what I understand, the minister [Mchunu] sent [a third party] to go ask for donations there and there, and I was one of them,\" Mr Matlala told MPs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also told the parliamentary panel that after the authorities had returned firearms seized from him, former Police Minister Bheki Cele had demanded \"a facilitation fee\" of 1m rand ($60,000; £45,000) to which he only paid half the amount. Mr Matlala alleged that Cele also allegedly asked for this money to stop harassment from the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He, however, denied receiving money from Mr Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala has not yet appeared at the Madlanga Commission but is expected to have a chance to speak there at some point next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various witnesses, however, painted a different picture of Mr Matlala's relationship with the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Commission witness later murdered</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness at the Madlanga Commission was murdered in early December, just three weeks after he gave testimony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear if the two events were connected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marius van der Merwe, who was identified only as \"Witness D\" during his appearance, was killed in full view of his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had just returned home in the evening and was gunned down as he waited for the front gate to open.

One conservative YouTuber who mixes blistering tirades with Bitcoin promotions wrote: \"I will vote for whatever President ... campaigns on arresting Pam Bondi over the cover up of the Epstein Files.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After folding into his coalition many non-traditional voters from the more fringe corners of the internet, Trump and members of his administration now find themselves coming face to face with the conspiratorial thinking they have stoked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the greatest cover-up by a president and for a president in history,\" said one member of a Facebook group devoted to sleuthing about the case. \"Epstein is the story and don't let up.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At issue isn't so much the previously unreleased pictures of people like Bill Clinton, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson and legendary news anchor Walter Cronkite in Epstein's company – which is not an indicator of any wrongdoing – but the sea of blacked-out redactions in the files themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail last year, Trump suggested that he would support the release of investigation files.

In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/trump-susie-wiles-interview-exclusive-part-1?srsltid=AfmBOop0SrRa46a44smA6ixheax1yd1RJx-mffopwLDG4O7PqWY154wf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a Vanity Fair article</a> published prior to the document release, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles described the people compelled to vote for Trump because of his promises on Epstein as \"Joe Rogan listeners\" – in other words, younger men who aren't traditionally into politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles has called the story a \"hit piece\". But she has not disputed specific quotes, including her assertion that Trump has not yet solidified a lasting Republican majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are inordinately interested in Epstein are the new members of the Trump coalition, the people that I think about all the time – because I want to make sure that they are not [only] Trump voters, they're Republican voters,\" she told the magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polls and experts back up the chief of staff's concerns about the tenuous nature of Trump's coalition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A survey released in early December by the right-wing Manhattan Institute think tank labelled nearly a third of Trump's supporters \"New Entrant Republicans\" – people who voted for the party for the first time in 2024. And the poll found that just over half of that category would \"definitely\" support a Republican in the 2026 mid-term elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These voters are drawn to Trump but are not reliably attached to the Republican Party,\" the institute concluded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The possible fragility of the Trump coalition is playing out on several different levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One crucial group is a collection of social media stars and podcasters who stand mostly outside traditional Republican circles but have clout and influence online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were instrumental in keeping social media attention on the Epstein story long after the convicted sex offender's death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group of influencers – including \"Libs of TikTok\" creator Chaya Raichik, conspiracy theorist and Turning Point USA activist Jack Posobiec, and elections organiser Scott Presler – were<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>even invited to an event at the Department of Justice (DoJ) and given binders, which Bondi described as a \"first phase\" of Epstein document releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Little if anything new was in the binders, which caused a backlash. Outrage swelled further in July after the DoJ released a memo saying that there was no Epstein \"client list\" and rejecting conspiracy theories about his death in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet following the most recent release, many of these same conservative influencers have been curiously silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Laura Loomer, a popular Maga social media influencer who has helped spread Epstein conspiracies online, claimed that they exonerated Trump from any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe now the media will stop obsessing over these files,\" wrote Loomer, who has mentioned Epstein at least 200 times on X this year alone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others - including several who were at the DoJ binder event - have not mentioned the document release at all, positively or negatively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their silence has been noted by other right-wing and far-right commentators, sparking online Maga infighting. And the row over the Epstein case is just one controversy currently roiling the movement, with arguments over free speech, anti-Semitism and Charlie Kirk's legacy <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp84p722m3do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">bursting out into the open at an annual conference put on by Turning Point USA this week</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jared Holt, senior researcher at Open Measures, a company that analyses online extremism, says the debate over the Epstein files is just one controversy contributing to the challenges facing the Maga movement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the beginning of the year, Maga was a triumphant intimidating cultural force, now the train is falling off the tracks and there's no clear sign that it will be stabilising or rebounding anytime soon,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It seems like the die-hard Trump base has atrophied over the course of the year,\" Holt says, but notes that it's too soon to tell if the recent heavily redacted document drop will have any significant impact on the sorts of \"Joe Rogan listeners\" Wiles is concerned about.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images The three members of Congress are outside in front of a stand of microphones and a sign reading \"Epstein files transparency act\"' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Rep Thomas Massie (c) speaking prior to last month's vote on a measure to compel the DoJ to release the files, along with Ro Khanna (l) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (r)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prominent voices in Congress have been less shy than the influencer class about criticising the justice department.
