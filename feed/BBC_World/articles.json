It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other cities tried to replicate its success, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1HL3drXNNWQVq7tpC6pMRsJ/the-bilbao-effect-how-20-years-of-gehrys-guggenheim-transformed-the-city\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">branded the \"Bilbao effect\"</a>, where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Pushing the envelope'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-31087980\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">brown paper bag</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But this did little to dampen the US president's rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the beginning of the event at the newly-renamed Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, Trump said the peace ceremony was a \"great day\" for Africa and the world, later branding it \"historic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a lot of confidence in both leaders,\" Trump added, with journalists noting he had mispronounced the names of both central African presidents. \"We'll keep these commitments. I know they're going to keep them and follow through on the agreement and create a much brighter future for the people of their countries.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump got the two countries' foreign ministers to sign a peace accord in June, hailing it as a \"glorious triumph\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of other African leaders also attended the ceremony, including those of Kenya, Angola, Burundi and Togo, as well as the vice-president of Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the event, Kagame praised Trump as an \"even-handed\" leader who is \"never taking sides\". Rwanda's president described Trump's approach as pragmatic and said that \"as a result, we have the clearest and most viable path forward that we have ever had\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tshisekedi expressed \"deep gratitude and clear hope\", while at the same time saying he hoped Rwanda would \"respect the letter and spirit of the deal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The foreign ministers of Qatar and the UAE also were in attendance at this signing - which Trump has dubbed the \"Washington Accords\" - as was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a day later, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told BBC Newsday he would not commit to withdrawing troops from DR Congo, denying that any are there in the first place. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is nowhere in any deal that states that Rwanda should withdraw its troops, because we don't have any troops in eastern DRC,\" he said. The deal says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.state.gov/peace-agreement-between-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-and-the-republic-of-rwanda\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">all parties should respect national borders and sovereignty and stop supporting armed groups.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN experts say <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgyzl1mlkvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Rwanda's army is in \"de facto control of M23 operations\"</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nduhungirehe also told the BBC he questioned Congolese commitment to the deal, saying it's \"something that needs to worry the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's as if what the DRC government has signed with its right hand, it doesn't believe with its heart\", he said, accusing Kinshasa of daily aerial strikes since first agreeing to the deal in June. DR Congo has recently accused Kigali of similar violations, and the UN said Rwandan troops and M23 militia remained on the ground.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 was not present - it is in talks with DR Congo's government in a parallel peace process led by Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration spearheaded the talks between DR Congo and Rwanda,  hoping that resolving their differences would pave the way for the US to increase investments in the resource-rich region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the signing ceremony, Trump said the US would send \"some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we're going to take out the rare earth, take out some of the assets, and pay,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to make a lot of money.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts are sceptical about whether the deal will lead to lasting peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A DR Congo researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Bram Verelst, told the BBC that there was \"currently no ceasefire in place, and the M23 rebellion continues to expand and consolidate its control\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The signing ceremony is unlikely to alter this situation, though there is some small hope it could increase accountability on Congolese and Rwandan leaders to honour their commitments,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 seized key cities in eastern DR Congo earlier this year, including Goma and Bukavu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh fighting was reported on Thursday, while on Tuesday, DR Congo army spokesman Gen Sylvain Ekenge said the rebels had launched a fresh offensive on villages in the South Kivu province. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The villages are about 75km (47 miles) from Uvira city, which lies on the border with Burundi and has been the headquarters of the South Kivu regional government since the rebels seized Bukavu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, the M23 said the DR Congo army had launched an air and ground assault against its positions, and this was done in cahoots with Burundian forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has not commented on the allegation. It has several thousand troops in eastern DR Congo to support the embattled army. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d23e/live/c5b08ab0-d05e-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A young girl sells vegetables near the meeting site of the M23 and residents in Goma in October 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The main trading hub in eastern DR Congo, Goma,  has been under rebel control since January</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda says it has adopted \"defensive measures\" in eastern DR Congo because of the threat posed by the FDLR militia group, which includes fighters who carried out the 1994 Rwandan genocide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kagame insists that the FDLR must be disarmed, while DR Congo demands the withdrawal of Rwandan troops from its territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both of these conditions are included in the peace deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, several deals going back to the 1990s have collapsed after Rwanda accused previous Congolese government of failing to disarm the FDLR, and this remains one of the main stumbling blocks in current efforts to end the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DR Congo's government has also demanded that the M23 gives up the territory it has seized, something it has so far refused to do in the Qatar-brokered talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Qatar and the US are co-ordinating their mediation efforts.

He is now on bail, according to local media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police told the BBC that it \"would handle any action taken in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also a strong public reaction to the arrest. To some, the decision to arrest him was \"baffling\". To others, it was simply Beijing's playbook, replicated. The Hong Kong government says that it's about trying to protect rule of law in a testing moment for the city. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'A human response to tragedy'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, disputed the suggestion that Hong Kongers are being suppressed. \"The government is trying to be prudent,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regina Ip, another Hong Kong lawmaker, also defended the arrests. Authorities are being \"extra careful\" that public anger does not led to a \"recurrence of the 2019 riots\", she told the BBC's Newshour radio programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the questions in the petition and being asked by many Hong Kongers include how the blaze could have swept through the buildings so rapidly and whether any government officials should be held responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have to differentiate genuine expressions of opinion from petitions with criminal intent. That is what our courts will have to find out,\" Ip added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kwan's petition, which listed \"four demands\" - echoing the \"five demands, not one less\" slogan that rallied protesters in 2019 - gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before it was taken down. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, the city's leader John Lee said Hong Kong would \"go all out\" to support victims and investigate the blaze. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He anounced a number of actions such as the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8ng18p7v3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">convening of an independent committee</a> to investigate the fire, a review of the building works system, and temporary accommodation and financial aid to victims. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of these were what people were calling for already - and they also formed a part of Kwan's petition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's baffling how Miles was [arrested] for asking basic questions on behalf of many residents, which the government went on to address anyway,\" said Samuel Chu, a pro-democracy activist who reposted Kwan's petition on a separate platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not a political campaign.

Spain was one of the \"big five\" countries who automatically qualify for the final, due to the size of their financial contribution to the staging of the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years that figure has been between €334,000 to €348,000, according to figures published by Spain's broadcaster, RTVE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other countries will now have to pick up that bill – although the costs will presumably be shared between all competitors, with France, Germany, Italy and the UK taking the lion's share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And if other countries pull out, the cost for every competing nation will presumably rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To lose some of your biggest financial contributors does have a huge impact, and it also has a ripple-down effect for some of the smaller countries,\" according to Jess Carniel of the University of Southern Queensland, a Eurovision scholar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So it does probably mean that we might have a smaller show [in 2026], unless the Austrian broadcaster can get together a bit more cash to make sure that it's still a spectacle.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Severely wounded</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That all means the competition is severely wounded, but the injuries aren't fatal... yet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday was \"a very seismic day in Eurovision\" history, according to Callum Rowe from The Euro Trip podcast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans are \"equally up in arms and devastated at what happened\", he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're losing countries that have got an illustrious and storied history in the competition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The four boycotting countries won't change their minds before next May's contest in Vienna, Mr Rowe said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether they'll have a change of heart for 2027 is another question. If they see that Israel don't perform very well in Eurovision in 2026 they might think, oh, well, the rule changes have done what they were meant to do. But I think it's difficult to say at this point.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eurovision director Martin Green estimates that 35 nations will still take part next year in Vienna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The loss of four competitors is balanced by the return of three others – Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria – who have skipped the last couple of years.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Not 'united by music'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The row will cast a long shadow of the contest next year, and probably in future years too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With much of the music industry throwing its weight behind Palestinian causes, it may prove harder than normal to find artists willing to share the stage with Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contest hasn't lived up to its slogan - \"United by music\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mr Weissmann insisted he didn't think the boycott would be damaging for Eurovision as it approaches its 70th anniversary in 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was built 10 years after World War Two - united by music - and that's what is all about.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a difficult situation all over the world with crisis [and] wars, and now it's our duty to keep in contact, to listen to each other, to argue - but then find democratic ways to deal with it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Right now, however, it's difficult to see how the ties that were cut on Thursday can be stitched back together.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

India is the world's fastest growing major economy.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was happy. Washington less so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dxr1g4y7yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an additional 25% tariff</a> on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's geopolitics at play, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn0r02zgjj4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">smiling and chatting together</a> sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a \"multi-polar world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia lauds its \"no limits partnership\" with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is just as vocal about its \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,\" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France.

India-US ties have hit <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15lqe7v302o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an all-time low</a> in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his \"true friend\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/international/world-wants-the-ukraine-war-to-end-but-russia-doesnt-seem-serious-about-peace/articleshow/125675348.cms\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">joint article</a> in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,\" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21, 2025 in Washington, DC\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India as penalty for buying Russian oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on

At least, not right now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But cars need fuel (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?</p></div></div></body></html>"
