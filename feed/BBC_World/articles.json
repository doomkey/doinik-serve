drafted by US and Russian officials last month - had caused much consternation in Ukraine and among its European allies, who said it was too favourable to the Kremlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the idea that the Trump administration was \"not engaging with both sides equally in this war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After talks in Geneva between the US and Ukraine concluded, Trump suggested that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he welcomed the proposed changes, Zelensky said the \"main problem\" was Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory Russia had taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow' forces also control Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the final peace plan should make it impossible for Moscow to invade again, and that Russia should \"definitely not\" rejoin the G8.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, she said: \"We can't go back to business as usual... how could you imagine that?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images South Korean actors Baek Il-Sub, Lee Soon-Jae, Shin Gu (Shin Goo) and Park Geun-Hyung attend the press conference for tvN \"Grandpas Over Flowers In Greece\" on March 24, 2015 in Seoul, South Korea.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That, at least, is what a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new peer-reviewed study</a> from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Michael Jackson's death</a> but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were striking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Ukraine</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed proposed changes to the controversial 28-point peace plan for ending the war with Russia.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears Ukraine's European allies produced an amended version of the plan after rejecting parts which favoured Russia's war aims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable...\" Zelensky said on Telegram. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, in the early hours of Tuesday, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said a wave of Russian missile and drone attacks hit an apartment building in the capital and disrupted electricity and water supplies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's Ministry of Energy also confirmed a \"massive, combined enemy attack\" on the country's energy infrastructure facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Energy officials will begin assessing the consequences and restoration work as soon as the security situation permits,\" it said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the plan, drafted by American and Russian officials in October, which had caused consternation in Kyiv and among its European allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Kremlin official rejected the amendments on Monday as \"completely unconstructive\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another development, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the Trump administration was not favouring Russia in its efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" she told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump was \"hopeful and optimistic\" that a plan could be worked out for ending the war, Leavitt added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the end of the talks in Geneva, Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Geneva, the talks began with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny the 28-point plan advocated by Trump had been written by the Kremlin, as several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said on Monday evening that the revised plan was \"truly the right approach\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,\" he added, without saying when.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an official in Zelensky's office, the 28-point plan leaked on Friday no longer existed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the Financial Times, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsa, who attended the weekend talks in Geneva, said the latest plan consisted of just 19 points, with some of the most politically sensitive elements, including territorial concessions, now due to be decided by the leaders themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A virtual \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">coalition of the willing</a>\" meeting of Ukraine's European allies will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was, he said, still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Moscow, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters: \"The European plan, at first glance... is completely unconstructive and does not work for us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said earlier on Monday that the \"main problem\" remained Putin's demand for legal recognition of territory Russia had taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until 27 November to accept the deal or risk losing US support created a sense of urgency across Europe on Friday, and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. It also controls Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

cancelled on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country had already been hit by several strikes since de Wever, a Flemish nationalist, came to office in February at the head of a centre-right coalition government aiming to cut the budget deficit.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early on Monday, his government reached a budget agreement which he said was the only way to \"guarantee the sustainability\" of Belgium's welfare state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's budget deficit stood at 4.5% of GDP at the end of last year with debt at 104.7% of GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU budget rules stipulate that member states should keep their budget deficit below 3% and debt beneath 60% to maintain sound public finances.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week's industrial action is meant

railroad company SNCB expecting to run one or two out of three trains, and several Eurostar services linking Brussels to Paris cancelled</li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">On Tuesday, public services such as schools, creches and hospitals join in</li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">On Wednesday a full general strike covers all categories including the two main airports, Bruxelles-Zaventem and Charleroi.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warning of the effect of the strike action in Belgium, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-updates\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Eurostar reported that some of its other international services had suffered delays </a>as a result.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defending the action, general workers union FGTB said a demonstration in Brussels two weeks ago had been met with \"total silence\" from the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fair pensions is a core issue cited by the unions while other demands include a fair wealth tax, a tax on digital activities for tech giants and the transparent screening of subsidies to companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A day of action against violence against women separately took place on Sunday which the FGTB said formed part of the current action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bruxelles-Zaventem airport has said it expects \"major disruptions\" to operations on Wednesday with all departure flights cancelled and some cancellations also possible for incoming flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The airport said that staff from their security and handling service provider were expected to be participating in the national industrial action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Charleroi airport has similarly said it will not be able to operate either scheduled departures or arrivals on the day of the general strike - as it also warned passengers of potential disruption on public service networks throughout the strike period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The City of Brussels has warned of \"disrupted services\" on its public transport links throughout the three days of action while transport company, De Lijn, which operates in Flanders has advised there will be \"fewer bus and tram services\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours.

A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses.

The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals.

They have drawn criticism from some quarters, including a few Labour MPs, even though the Conservatives gave the measures a cautious welcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reforms are \"in line with what countries around the world do\" to stop the abuse of their immigration systems, Malhotra told the BBC in the southern Indian city of Chennai, adding that there was a \"very strong message we also send, which is that we welcome those coming legally\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Malhotra some16,000 international students from across the world had applied for asylum in the UK last year after completing their courses, which she said was evidence of abuse of legal migration routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A further 14,800 students sought asylum this year to June 2025, latest <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/immigration-system-statistics-year-ending-june-2025/how-many-people-claim-asylum-in-the-uk\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Home Office figures </a>show. It is unclear how many of them are Indian nationals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've seen visa abuse in the case of legal routes, where people have gone legally and then sought to overstay when their visas weren't extended,\" Malhotra said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you see that level of abuse, it undermines your immigration system. It undermines public confidence, and the fairness and control people expect.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India remains one of the UK's biggest sources of international students, but demand is cooling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of Indian students heading to the UK has fallen 11% from last year as tougher immigration rules kick in. This has triggered concern among UK universities which rely on foreign students and are already under financial strain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, India was the top country of origin for foreign students in the UK in 2023-2024, making up 25% of arrivals. China followed at 23% while Nigeria made up 8%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Malhotra said while Britain still \"very much welcomes\" Indian students, her government was working with universities to ensure they are genuine foreign students. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said the recently concluded <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y6y90e5vzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">free trade agreement </a>(FTA) between the UK and India had also encouraged UK universities to open local campuses in India, with Liverpool University announcing it will open a campus in Bengaluru city in 2026 last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FTA, signed in July after years of negotiations, is forecast to boost the UK's GDP by £4.8bn annually and expand bilateral trade between the two countries by £25.5bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the education chapter in the deal, nine UK universities have been cleared to set up campuses across India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, these wider trade ambitions face a domestic political climate that has hardened around migration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a visit to India in October, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK would not relax visa rules for Indian nationals despite Delhi's long-standing push for easier mobility in return for trade concessions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Malhotra rejected the idea that Britain wants deeper trade while shutting the door to Indian professionals, citing the nearly half-a-million visas granted to Indian nationals last year across work, study and visitor categories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK is moving towards a \"contribution-based\" immigration system, where settlement and long-term stay depend on a person's economic contribution rather than the length of time they have lived in the country, Malhotra said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's proposal to overhaul the UK's immigration system is part of a broader attempt to show firmer control over borders, but has drawn criticism from some Labour MPs and members of the House of Lords, particularly over their potential impact on international recruitment in sectors like healthcare and social care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the reforms are still under consultation, Malhotra, when asked about settlement routes for migrant professionals like nurses and care workers said, \"we are expanding routes for those with skills in areas that the UK requires\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rcn.org.uk/news-and-events/news/uk-almost-50000-nursing-staff-could-leave-uk-under-proposed-new-visa-rules-rcn-warns-201125\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">survey </a>by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) had warned that up to 50,000 nurses could leave the UK if the government went ahead with its immigration proposals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report notes that the UK now has more than 200,000 internationally educated nursing staff, making up around 25% of the country's total nursing workforce of 794,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A significant number of these nurses and care workers are from India. Several investigations, including by the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d8ll1l590o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BBC</a>, have shown that many of them have fallen prey to cross-border visa scams and lost hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Malhotra said the UK was ramping up efforts to protect people from such exploitation and working with law enforcement agencies of countries like India to share intelligence and crack down on such gangs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

In terms of landmass, Niger is the largest state in Nigeria, and larger than European countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also has a lot of forests, which criminal gangs, referred to locally as bandits, use as camps and routes to connect to other states in Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction at the school was the third to hit Nigeria in a week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state, which borders Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A church was also attacked further south in Kwara state, with two people killed and dozens of worshippers abducted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bola Tinubu cancelled his trip to the G20 summit, held in South Africa at the weekend, to deal with the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He posted on social media on Sunday that all the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/officialABAT/status/1992632498350637188\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">38 worshippers abducted in Kwara state had been rescued</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: I will not relent.

In just a few months, the two women could be deported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption \"scarred\" her, but she \"wanted a better life for him\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. \"Three weeks later they were approved and on an airplane and here with us,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway, before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now \"feels more complete\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply.

So Kyiv had to engage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though -<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Ukraine's deputy foreign minister<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

crime expert from Mexico's UNAM university, says the group's activities started in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to developments in neighbouring Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, the powerful Medellín Cartel, based in the Colombian city of the same name, was being dismantled and a major counter-narcotics offensive in the country was bearing fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As established smuggling routes came under pressure, Mr Benítez-Manau argues, the Cartel de los Soles began providing alternative ways to transport cocaine from Colombia. It then strengthened during the early years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez, the left-wing president who led Venezuela from 1999 to his death in 2013, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chávez liked to challenge the United States, and cut all military co-operation ties between the Venezuelan army and the US,\" he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the oversight of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \"some [Venezuelan] army officers felt free to do business with criminals\", Mr Benítez-Manau says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chávez's sympathies with Colombia's left-wing Farc guerrillas - which financed themselves largely through cocaine smuggling - were another factor in re-routing some drug trafficking through Venezuela, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Facing military pressure at home, the guerrilla group moved some operations into Venezuela, safe in the knowledge that the Venezuelan president \"saw them as leftist ideological allies\", Mr Benítez-Manau explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wesley Tabor, a former DEA agent who worked in Venezuela, says the Farc not only found \"a safe haven in Venezuela\" but also many government officials, \"from street-level police to the military aviation\", soon became their partners in drug trafficking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Together, they \"began flooding the US with hundreds of tonnes of cocaine\", he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Former Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal during his extradition hearing to the United States in Madrid, 2019.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Former intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cartel de los Soles, then, differs from other drug networks in that it lacks a formal structure,  says Mr LaSusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not a group per se, he says, but rather \"a system of widespread corruption\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds it has been fuelled by the economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela under President Chávez's successor in office, Nicolás Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Maduro regime cannot offer security forces a decent salary and, to keep their loyalty, it allows them to accept bribes from drug traffickers,\" Mr LaSusa explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mid- and lower-ranking officers who control Venezuela's key entry and exit points, such as airports, make up the Cartel de los Soles, Mr Benítez-Manau says, as they are in prime position to facilitate the flow of drugs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US officials are adamant that the tentacles of the Cartel de los Soles reach to the highest levels of the Maduro government, including the president himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, the US justice department accused Maduro and 14 others of conspiring with armed Colombian groups to ship cocaine to the United States. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the high-ranking officials named were Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino and the former head of Venezuela's Supreme Court, Maikel Moreno. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the indictment, US prosecutors also alleged that since at least 1999, the Cartel de los Soles was led and administered by Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, and former General Clíver Alcalá.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say information provided by former high-ranking Venezuelan military officials -

There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Ukrainian soldiers in full battle dress sit on a cannon in a muddy field.  \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">It is thought more than 800,000 Ukrainians are currently in uniform</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Security guarantees</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union.

Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43588465\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries and is recovering from the legacy of a brutal 11-year civil war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">World Health Organization data</a> shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Undercover filming of a man who said he was a juju practitioner and claimed to sell human body parts</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a lecturer at the UK's Arden University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The police raided this house in Waterloo and arrested the occupants, including Idara, who were later charged under anti-witchcraft laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-chris-alcock-and-luis-barrucho\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</i></p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More BBC Africa Eye stories from Sierra Leone:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Hotels were full, restaurants bustling, and fishermen could barely keep up with demand. But that is no more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boom – and the abrupt collapse – was no accident. Between 2015 and 2017, Chinese tourists made up around half of its visitors. Then, in 2017, Beijing reportedly ordered tour operators to stop selling packages to Palau, slashing the main source of tourism to the islands at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I actually bought new boats to accommodate the sudden increase of tourists,\" said a dive shop owner in Koror. But after the tourism peak, he said, these boats had been \"sitting idle in the bay\" and it took them years just to make back the money they spent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message was clear, Palauan officials allege. They say that China had used its vast outbound tourism market as part of a broader campaign to try to peel Palau away from recognising Taiwan - and into Beijing's orbit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment but has not received a response. China has, however, in the past repeatedly denied using tourism as political leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau is one of only a dozen nations that still recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state. This challenges a key pillar of China's foreign policy, the \"one China principle\", in which Beijing asserts sovereignty over Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's not just about a diplomatic tug of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau's location makes it a desirable target for influence from the world's biggest powers. It sits on the so-called \"Second Island Chain\" – a string of outposts the US sees as crucial to containing China's military expansion and responding to any aggression in the western Pacific.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau and the US have a long history of partnership: before its independence in 1994, Palau was a US-administered territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under an agreement known as the Compact of Free Association, Palau gives the US exclusive military access in exchange for Washington's extensive aid, including Palauan citizens' ability to live and work freely in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Working under the terms of the Compact, the US is now strengthening its own military footprint in the archipelago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This geopolitical power struggle between China, Taiwan, and the US is cascading down into the daily lives of this tiny nation of fewer than 20,000 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter what we do, Palau is going to be the centre of any military activity because of our location,\" Palau's President, Surangel Whipps Jr. told the BBC.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Palau's president, Surangel Whipps Jr.</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A prize in the Pacific</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau's relationship with Taiwan runs deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Palau became independent in 1994, Taiwan moved fast to secure a diplomatic ally, according to Cheng-Cheng Li, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who has conducted extensive research on Taiwan-Palau relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's assistance to it has been hands-on: agricultural experts working side by side with locals, medical teams in small clinics, funding for local entrepreneurs, and inviting students to Taiwan on scholarships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a country with a small population where community-based service plays a central role, Taiwan has been described as a \"reliable partner\" and a \"trusted friend\" by many Palauan officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's ambassador to Palau, Jessica Lee, told the BBC that local leaders had assured her that the relationship was \"solid as a rock until death do us part.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Taiwan has reason to worry. In recent years, China has peeled away several of its former allies. In the Pacific region alone, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru have severed their diplomatic ties with it and switched to Beijing since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing sees the democratically governed island of Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Controlling Taiwan is essential to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's goal of reversing what he called China's \"century of humiliation\" by colonial powers, according to analysts.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"One Stop Shop,\" a government building in Palau, donated by Taiwan</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both the US and Taiwan are paranoid and jumpy about Palau switching,\" said Graeme Smith, a senior fellow at the Australian National University. \"They'll put a lot of resources into making sure it doesn't happen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials in both Palau and Taiwan say Beijing has pulled on a range of levers to influence Palau's diplomatic position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After he took office in 2021, Palau's president publicly claimed that China offered \"a million\" tourists in exchange for Palau to this end. He refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then in 2024, China's foreign ministry issued a safety alert, advising Chinese nationals to \"exercise caution\" when travelling to Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If China uses tourism as a weapon, then it's an unstable market that we shouldn't depend on,\" President Whipps Jr. told the BBC. \"If China wants a relationship with Palau, they can, but they cannot tell us we cannot have a relationship with Taiwan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China, however, denies using tourism as a political tool.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an opinion published last year in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist party, the paper stated that China's intention when issuing the alert was to protect its overseas citizens in light of the \"increasing public security cases in Palau\". It added that the accusations from the president were an attempt to smear China and interfere in its domestic affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked in 2017 about the banning of tour groups, China's foreign ministry spokesperson said that he \"had not heard about the situation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 2024, responding to Palau's continued recognition of Taiwan, the ministry urged Palau to \"make the correct decisions that conform to their own... interests\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whilst China has not commented on the alleged offer of a million tourists, not everyone agrees with President Whipps Jr.'s assessment. Many locals who spoke with the BBC don't share the president's view on tourism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's very hawkish towards China,\" said Pai Lee, the Taiwanese owner of a hotel in Koror. \"I don't think it's correct to say that China 'weaponised' tourism – they are simply using this as a bargaining chip, just like how people play chess and countries do it all the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any case, the legacy of the sudden tourism swing remains visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The economic shock after the suspension of tour groups  was sharp, but so was the environmental toll of the sudden influx of tourists itself. Palau, according to environmental protection organisations, was not ready for mass tourism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After the end of the explosion of Chinese tourism, I went there and the corals were dead,\" said Ann Singeo, director of the Ebiil Society, a local NGO.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You'd see [hundreds of] people in this little cove, all standing on corals. That was the price we paid because we didn't have rules in place to use these resources respectfully.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aerial shot of Rock Islands, Koror, Palau</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism is just one part of China's alleged playbook. Beijing has also been trying to strengthen relationships with local leaders: Palauan officials say they have repeatedly been invited to Beijing for visits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one such visit, a former Palauan governor said he asked why Taiwan couldn't become independent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Taiwan is part of China\", replied a Chinese Communist Party official, looking furious.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The US factor</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With China's intensifying military activities around Taiwan, including air and sea patrols, the US has claimed that China is readying its military to be capable of invading it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To contain China's potential aggression towards Taiwan and overall military activities in the western Pacific, the US has ramped up its own military infrastructure buildup in Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, Washington has been upgrading airstrips, building Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-horizon Radar system (Tacmor) used to monitor military activities in the Pacific, and planning on expanding Malakal Harbour, Palau's main port, to accommodate larger military vessels.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Field cleared for construction for Tacmor receiver site in Angaur, Palau</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US has expressed concern over a particular vulnerability: land acquisition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Documents seen by the BBC show that several Chinese businesses have leased land and developed properties close to these sites, from undeveloped land to hotels overlooking the harbour and Palau's main airport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Angaur, a southern state of Palau, for example, the US is now building the receiver site of Tacmor – the plan was announced in 2017. However, in 2019 and 2020, Chinese investors leased land covering over 350,000 square metres following the announcement of radar construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One investor, Zhuang Cizhong, proposed building a resort there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We went to visit his company in China, and he laid out a plan for a retirement home for rich Chinese,\" said the former governor of Angaur, Marvin Ngirutang, who believes Palau's government should work more closely with China. \"There were booklets of blueprints – it looked legitimate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The project was never built. Zhuang blamed Covid-19, but Washington remains wary. The US ambassador in Palau could not be reached for comment, but he has previously voiced his concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All around there are various plots of land now leased to Chinese interests,\" US ambassador Joel Ehrendreich told Reuters. \"I don't think it's any coincidence that it happens to be physically close to our projects.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such worries are shared locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The concern is that these investments or leases are not legitimate businesses,\" said Jennifer Anson, Palau's national security advisor. \"Maybe on the outside, but when the time comes that China invades Taiwan, these could be transformed into military sites.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese media reports, however, suggest that there were legitimate reasons to push for businesses to invest in Palau. In 2019, Phoenix News, a state-affiliated broadcaster, extolled the virtues of buying property in Palau, citing abundant tourism resources and relaxed legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC is unable to contact Zhuang. China's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on matters related to land leases.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">In the shadows of a diplomatic void</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese-linked organised crime has also proliferated since 2018, according to authorities in Palau. President Whipps Jr. said that there was a \"constant battle going on\" as he pointed to crimes linked to China, including scamming, illegal casinos, and cyberattacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some officials claim criminals have exploited the lack of diplomatic ties between China and Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wan Kuok Koi, known as \"Broken Tooth,\" who led the infamous Macau-based 14k triad, for example, entered Palau as a foreign investor in 2018. The crime syndicate later engaged in bribery, corruption and online gambling in countries including Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Additionally, in 2025, the US Treasury sanctioned several individuals in Palau for their links to the Prince Group, a Chinese-run conglomerate. The group has been accused of scamming, money laundering, industrial-scale human trafficking, among other crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prince Group did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but has previously \"categorically\" denied having engaged in \"any unlawful activity,\" according to the company's statement following the US sanction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of these individuals have been placed on Palau's own \"undesirable alien list\", and according to Ms. Anson from Palau's national security office, they are banking on China's inability to hunt them down because of the lack of diplomatic relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you trawl Chinese diaspora sites in Cambodia, where the wisdom of relocating to Palau is sometimes debated, the criminals themselves are drawn by the lack of PRC diplomatic presence there,\" said ANU's Graeme Smith.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Pawn of powers</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many Palauans, talk of high-level geopolitical struggle feels distant, yet its ripples are everywhere. The US military expansion, Chinese investment, and rumours of hidden agendas feed a growing sense of unease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This administration is very hawkish towards China, and I think it's ridiculous,\" said the former governor of Angaur, who opposes the construction of Tacmor. \"We should concentrate on the environment and less on China-US relations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A petition circulating in recent months asks Washington to spell out its contingency plans in the event of war – a sign of how deep the anxiety runs. It calls on the US to \"reassure the people of Palau\" that civilians will be protected if conflict was o break out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know what the geopolitics looks like between China and the US,\" said one resident. \"And we are scared our island will be destroyed by a war we don't want to be part of\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"><i id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-on-monday-24-november-at-7pm-on-bbc-two-and-also-on-iplayer.-internationally,-viewers-can-see-global-eye-on-the-bbc-news-channel-this-weekend\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye on Monday 24 November at 7pm on BBC Two and also on iPlayer.

Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In the streets of Caracas, daily life continues while the government tells the population that they must be ready for a US invasion</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bolívar (in Bolívar state, south) tells the BBC by phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Consuelo says that uncertainty also makes Venezuelans nervous</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike… people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Javier Jaramillo also does not believe that an attack on Venezuela is imminent</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's now midday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
