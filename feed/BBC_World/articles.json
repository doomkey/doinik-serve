Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows. These materials may have caused the fire to spread more quickly, said police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police spokesperson said: \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those hospitalised, 45 are in a serious condition. The injured were sent to hospitals in various districts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze<b id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">.</b> He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris has hampered rescue efforts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The temperature inside the buildings concerned are very high, so it's quite difficult for us to enter... and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operation,\" said Derek Armstrong Chan, the deputy director of fire services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire has yet to be extinguished and officials have said they were unsure when it would be. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and is made up of eight tower blocks that provide 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Seven of the towers have been affected by the fire.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some residents have told local media that the fire alarms did not sound, and when the elevators stopped working, they struggled to get out. A local councillor said many of the people who lived at Wang Fuk Court are elderly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were also reports on Wednesday night of blasts being heard from inside the buildings, and fire hoses were struggling to reach the upper levels of the 31-storey towers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police have also evacuated nearby buildings, and several temporary shelters have been opened. One of the shelters, located over the road from the housing complex, was deemed unsafe as the fire continued to rage, and evacuees were directed to another further away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An officer at a temporary shelter told the AFP news agency it was unclear how many people were unaccounted for because residents were still trickling in late into the night to report missing family members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a large evacuation zone around the fire, roads are closed and more than 30 bus routes have been diverted, Hong Kong's Transport Department says.</p></div><div data-component=\"group-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><section class=\"sc-2d9149e5-0 cSvbpL\"><div data-testid=\"slideshowWrapper\" class=\"sc-bb9c31df-0 eyDYxi\"><hr class=\"sc-bb9c31df-13 TJGYy\"><div class=\"sc-bb9c31df-9 sc-bb9c31df-12 kJXtbZ dLZLyt\"><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-11 CMaeP loiCSF djVHpK\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">As the fire continues to burn, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessed</figcaption></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The blaze is expected to have a profound effect on both the community and the estate itself</figcaption></p></div></div></section></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been 17 years since Hong Kong faced a level five fire, when a building constructed in 1962, Cornwall Court, burnt down.

The cause is not yet known, but three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to flammable materials, including mesh and plastic sheets, that may have allowed the fire to spread quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a disaster,\" Thomas said of the fire, telling the BBC he had seen a body being taken away. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many people sent us WhatsApp messages or called us, saying they still have relatives inside or can't find them,\" Mui Siu-fung, a councillor for the Tai Po district, told BBC Chinese. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than a thousand other people were forced to evacuate the estate as the flames spread, with some heading to centres that have been set up to house them. Police also moved people from nearby buildings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire was gradually being contained but officials said they did not know when it would be fully extinguished.

There are so many neighbours and friends. I do not know what is going on anymore. Look, all the apartments are just burning. I do not know what to do.

I travelled to southern Lebanon to see the impact of the Israeli campaign, and saw that the attacks had shattered people's sense of security and even some long-held views in areas where Hezbollah has traditionally enjoyed widespread support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ceasefire in Lebanon ended 13 months of war that killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis. Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting for decades, and this conflict started when Hezbollah began firing rockets and missiles over the border a day after Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The truce, brokered by the US and France, required Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, and Israeli troops to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon that they invaded during the war. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers would then be sent to areas that had been effectively under Hezbollah control.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, the Israeli military continues to occupy at least five hilltops in southern Lebanon and has carried out air and drone attacks across the country on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn81j54xjx1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Last Sunday, it killed the group's chief of staff and four others</a> in a strike on a building in the Dahieh district, outside Beirut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon that operates south of the Litani, says Israel has committed more than 10,000 air and ground violations during the ceasefire.

But, for weeks, Israeli journalists have been briefed on plans for a possible escalation against the group. \"Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,\" Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said recently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joseph Aoun, the Lebanese president, came to power in January promising a \"state monopoly on arms\" - in other words, to disarm Hezbollah. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, Hezbollah is more than a militia. Despite the recent blows, it remains a powerful political party with representation in the government and parliament, and a significant social movement, providing services in areas where the state is absent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Unifil spokesperson told me they had not observed any military activity by Hezbollah or attempts to rebuild infrastructure. Hezbollah, too, rejects the Israeli allegations and says the terms of the ceasefire deal only apply to south of the Litani. There, it has not opposed the Lebanese army's operations against its arsenal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has not fired on Israel since the truce came into force, although it did launch several mortars that hit an Israeli army base in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights in December, in response to what it said were repeated Israeli violations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC Hands hold a mobile phone, on which can be seen a satellite image with red and blue dots marking locations.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The map, issued by a spokesperson for the Israeli military, showing locations that were allegedly being used by Hezbollah in the village of Beit Lif</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli army, published on social media a warning for the Lebanese village of Beit Lif: Israel had detected \"dozens of terrorist infrastructures\" belonging to Hezbollah, and would act to remove any threat. Worried that an attack could be imminent, residents made a public appeal, late at night, for Lebanese soldiers to be deployed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I visited Beit Lif the following morning. (To travel to southern Lebanon, we had to inform Hezbollah's media office in Beirut; the group did not interfere in our reporting.) The village had a pre-war population of around 8,000; now, less than a third remains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local imam, a 63-year-old man who did not want to have his name published, told me the Lebanese soldiers had arrived with Unifil troops, patrolled the streets and left after about five hours, before dawn. The Lebanese military has refused to inspect private properties, possibly in order not to be seen to be collaborating with Israel; in Beit Lif too, the imam said, they did not enter any houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we spoke, half a dozen men gathered around us on the grounds of a mosque that had been destroyed in an Israeli air strike during the war. Quietly, one of them told me: \"Hezbollah needs to decide: it either responds to Israel or accepts defeat, disarms and let us move on with our lives. This can't continue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public criticism of Hezbollah is still rare but, exhausted, some appear to be questioning the old consensus. We then heard a distant sound – from Israeli fighter jets in the sky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the locations that appeared to have been highlighted in Col Adraee's  message was a house in front of the municipality building. Israel has frequently accused Hezbollah of embedding its arsenal in civilian areas, an allegation I had also heard from some residents during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ezzat Hammoud, the Beit Lif mayor, told me: \"No, no, no. There are no militants or weapons here. I can be held responsible for what I'm saying.\" So why, if that was the case, had his village attracted the attention of the Israeli military? \"Either to terrify the residents and force them to move,\" he said, \"or to put pressure on the Lebanese army to confront people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man is seen on a road, with a woman nearby, in front of a building which has a large image on the side.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Haider said his house had been marked by the Israeli military as a building being used by Hezbollah, which he denied</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A man called Haider, whose family owned the house, insisted on taking me to visit it. Outside, a poster remembered his brother, a Hezbollah fighter, who had been killed in the war. Haider said he wanted to prove there was nothing wrong there, appearing to believe that by being in the media he would, somehow, be protected. \"You can enter room by room and check with your own eyes,\" he said. It is difficult for us to confirm what could be happening here. He later said: \"We want stability, we don't want war, or anything related to it.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just months ago, it would have been almost impossible to have a conversation like this or even talk to people without being approached by Hezbollah members. Haider complained about how unsafe he felt, and I asked him what Hezbollah should do. He did not give me a straight answer but said: \"We're done. We're worn out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the warning, Israel has not attacked the village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a televised speech earlier this month, Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's secretary general, addressed the issue of Israel's continued attacks, warning that \"everything has a limit\". He said the group would \"never\" surrender its weapons, which he called the \"source of its strength\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The enemy,\" Qassem said, referring to Israel and the United States, \"wants to erase our life and our existence, but we'll remain steadfast. We'll either live with dignity or die with dignity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hezbollah's arsenal, more powerful than that of the country's own army, has long divided the Lebanese. Opponents accuse Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into wars and of defending the interests of the group's main backer, Iran. They see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it. But President Aoun, who is a former army chief, has refused to use force against Hezbollah, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to a civil war. If the authorities were not careful, Aoun said in April, \"we'll lead Lebanon to ruin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Western diplomat familiar with the discussions told me the Lebanese authorities were under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, which was frustrated with the pace of the efforts and supported Israel's actions in Lebanon. \"Some are seeing this as the 'Lebanese way' of doing things,\" the diplomat said about the disarmament plans, and \"aren't convinced\" it can work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army is expected to announce it has completed the disarmament of the group in the areas south of the Litani next month. The army, an intelligence officer told me, would then turn its attention to other parts of the country - Hezbollah's presence is also significant in the Dahieh and the eastern Bekaa Valley. This will be a more challenging, and risky, mission without the group's consent, and there is no timeline for that.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e46d/live/093d3890-cad4-11f0-8a1e-8f6cb8f8b753.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC A large green billboard on stilts displays images of men on a green background.

That is when a leaked draft of a 28-point US plan to end the war first emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan, whose references to Ukraine giving up territory and limiting the size of its military led some to describe it as a \"Russian wish list\", caused consternation in Kyiv and sent European diplomats scrambling to limit the perceived damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some ways, it felt like a re-run of events in August, when anxious European leaders rushed to Washington to bend Trump's ear after the American president rolled out the red carpet to Putin in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the weekend, the Europeans had drafted a counter-proposal, also 28 points long, which replaced the blunt territorial concessions of the US plan with \"negotiations on territorial swaps\" and stiffened the language on security guarantees, a key concern of Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how much influence the Europeans had over Sunday's talks in Geneva remains unclear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A joint US-Ukrainian statement, issued after the talks wrapped up, spoke of \"highly productive\" discussions, saying any future agreement must deliver a \"sustainable and just peace\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer was one of several European leaders who seized on the words \"sustainable and just\" as indicating that progress had been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials sounded relieved too.

Following Tuesday's virtual meeting of the UK-French led Coalition of the Willing, participants agreed with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, to \"accelerate joint work with the United States to take forward the planning on security guarantees\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer says operational plans for a multinational \"reassurance force\" for Ukraine are fully formed but until the Trump administration indicates what, if any, backup it is willing to provide, those plans remain largely theoretical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Security guarantees are going to have to be fleshed out,\" says Ambassador Fried.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Coalition of the Willing is a great idea, but it hasn't landed on any result to date, partly because they are waiting to see whether the Americans will back them and partly because they're waiting to see what they're going into.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where we are on territory is another big unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week's 28-point plan stated, bluntly, that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be \"recognised as de facto Russian\", and that Ukrainian forces would withdraw from the heavily contested parts of the Donetsk region still under Kyiv's control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this language vanished in the European counter-proposal. Ukraine, it said, would commit \"not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means\". All territorial negotiations, it said, would \"start from the Line of Contact\" – the current front lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not known the extent to which Europe's approach informed the document that emerged after the talks in Geneva.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The joint US-Ukrainian communique offered only an oblique insight, saying the two sides \"reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The word \"fully\" appeared to be carrying a lot of weight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given Trump's mercurial approach to the war in Ukraine, Putin's lingering ambitions and Zelensky's domestic difficulties - the current round of diplomacy takes place in the midst of a corruption scandal that is undermining his domestic standing - it is extremely difficult to know where this process goes next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it might be overly optimistic to think we are near the end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're still in the middle of this process,\" says Leslie Shedd, another of the Atlantic Council's non-resident fellows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's certainly a long way to go still.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for all the apparent chaos surrounding the Trump administration's efforts, including a constantly shifting – and possibly competing – cast of characters, Shedd believes the administration is serious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It appears that the president… [is] truly prioritising finding a peace in Ukraine. And I think that is actually really important.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the leaked audio recording obtained and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">shared as a transcript by Bloomberg</a>, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech.

Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were words that brought crowds out across Italy demanding change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two years on, MPs have voted for a law on femicide after a long and passionately debated session of parliament. It makes Italy one of very few places to categorise femicide as a distinct crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Introduced by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the law was backed by her own hard-right government as well as opposition MPs. Many wore red ribbons or red jackets to remember the victims of violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From now on, Italy will record every murder of a woman that is motivated by her gender as femicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Femicides will be classified, they will be studied in their real context, they will exist,\" Judge Paola di Nicola, one of the authors of the new law, said of its significance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was part of an expert commission that examined 211 recent murders of women for common characteristics, then drafted the femicide law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Talking of such crimes as rooted in exasperated love or strong jealousy is a distortion – that uses romantic, culturally acceptable terms,\" the judge argues, surrounded by her research at her home in Rome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This law means we will be the first in Europe to reveal the real motivation of the perpetrators, which is hierarchy and power.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Italy will now join <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2025/772921/EPRS_BRI(2025)772921_EN.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Cyprus, Malta and Croatia as EU member states</a> that have introduced a legal definition of femicide into their criminal codes. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Judge Paola di Nicola helped draft the new law on femicide, the first of its kind in Europe</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no agreed worldwide definition of femicide, which makes it hard to count and compare statistics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Italian law will apply to murders which are \"an act of hatred, discrimination, domination, control, or subjugation of a woman as a woman\", or that occur when she breaks off a relationship or to \"limit her individual freedoms.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest police data in Italy shows a slight fall in the number of women killed last year to 116, with 106 said to be motivated by gender. In future, such cases would be recorded separately and trigger an automatic life sentence, meant as a deterrent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gino Cecchettin isn't sure such a law would have saved his daughter: her killer was sent to prison for life in any case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he does think defining and discussing the problem is important.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Before, many people especially from the centre and extreme right didn't want to hear the word femicide,\" Mr Cecchettin told the BBC. \"Now this is a world where we can speak about it.

dismissal concludes the last of Trump's four criminal cases, only one of which saw trial and resulted in a conviction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Georgia appeals court<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77jdk4k717o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis</a> from the case after it determined a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68038189\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">romantic relationship with a special prosecutor</a> created an \"appearance of impropriety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan agency Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, appointed himself to the case after Willis' disqualification and when other state prosecutors declined to take the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Wednesday's motion to a Fulton County judge, he said he was discontinuing the case \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a former elected official who ran as both a Democrat and a Republican and now is the Executive Director of a non-partisan agency, this decision is not guided by a desire to advance an agenda but is based on my beliefs and understanding of the law,\" Skandalakis added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around five million votes for president were cast in Georgia in 2020, with Biden winning the critical swing state by just under 12,000 votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and some of his allies refused to accept the result, and the state quickly became a focal point for efforts to overturn the election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January 2021, The Washington Post published a recording of Trump speaking with Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,\" Trump said in the recording.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willis began investigating Trump's activities soon after the report, convening a special grand jury to weigh the facts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66505804\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Willis filed an indictment in August 2023</a> alleging that Trump conspired with 18 other defendants to interfere in the election result. The charges included racketeering and other state offences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group \"refused to accept that Trump lost, and they knowingly and wilfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four co-defendants took plea deals with prosecutors that resulted mostly in fines, suspended sentences and community service, including attorneys Sidney Powell, Kenneth Cheseboro, and Jenna Ellis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wednesday's dismissal also applies to the remaining co-defendants, including former New York mayor and Trump's former attorney Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, chief of staff during Trump's first presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Sadow, president Trump's lead attorney in the case, praised the decision to drop the charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over,\" he said. \"This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Georgia election interference case was once considered the most threatening of Trump's four criminal indictments, because he could not pardon himself from state-level charges if he returned to office. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors brought Trump to the Fulton County Jail, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-66612345\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">where they took his mugshot.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Legal experts who closely followed the case were not surprised by its dismissal. A <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8x8vw4gwpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">judge tossed out several of the charges</a> in 2024, and Willis was disqualified a few months later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willis' removal raised doubts about whether a replacement would take up such a complicated prosecution. Trump's 2024 election essentially put his case on hold until his term ends in 2029. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was incredibly unlikely it was going to go forward anyway, because the amount of financial resources and man hours necessary to take on this case didn't seem to be within the scope of what Peter Skandalakis had,\" said Anthony Michael Kreis, a professor at the Georgia State College of Law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Mr Kries was surprised by some of Skandalakis' reasoning for dropping the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the report itself to me is a little more surprising because it seems to give the president and some of his allies a lot of benefit of the doubt, given what the evidence brought forth looked like,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also faced a series of other criminal proceedings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a 2024 conviction in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9wgzlqwnp2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a New York hush-money case</a>, which he is appealing against. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two additional federal cases - one alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and another accusing him of unlawfully retaining classified documents - were dropped <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gvd7kxxj5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">following his return to the White House.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also faces several high-profile civil lawsuits which are progressing through the appeals courts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Trump <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0egyzm5yjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">asked the US Supreme Court</a> to review the $5m (£3.6m) civil case brought by writer E Jean Carroll, after a federal appeals court upheld the award and declined to rehear the matter. A jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming Ms Carroll, allegations he denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, a New York appeals court <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y09q1zgg8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">threw out a $500m civil fraud penalty</a> against Trump that resulted from a separate, civil fraud lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The appeals panel upheld the lower court's finding that Trump and his businesses committed fraud, but found the enormous fine was excessive.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

High Court judge Geoffrey Venning said Lee's mental health played a part in the case, but that her actions were calculated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The children's remains were discovered only in 2022 by a couple who won an auction for the contents of an abandoned storage unit in Auckland.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn83jjx9pjvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a trial</a> lasting more than two weeks, Hakyung Lee's defence lawyers told the court that her mental health deteriorated after Jo's death, and that she came to believe it was best if the rest of the family died together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee tried to kill herself and her children by giving them <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1wgqpx3q1go\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a dose of the antidepressant nortriptyline</a> mixed in juice, but got the dose wrong and woke up to find her children were dead, her lawyers said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors argued that Lee's was \"a selfish act to free herself from the burden of parenting alone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the killings, Lee changed her name and left New Zealand. She was arrested in South Korea - where she was born - in September 2022, and extradited back to New Zealand later that year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court heard on Wednesday how the killings pained Lee's and her husband Ian Jo's families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an emotional statement read out by prosecutors, Lee's mother Choon Ja Lee  said she regrets not taking her daughter to a counsellor, noting that Lee had \"no will to live\" after Jo died of cancer in November 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If she wanted to die, why didn't she die alone?

Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Matías Zibell García Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez leaning on tyres at his garage\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Matías Zibell García</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Business has boomed for mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This accounts \"for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Añelo's size and population has soared over the past decade</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won't be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Roads in and around Añelo are now busy with traffic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The underlying problem, he says, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralizing and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate is important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And another: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted, \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"> Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bear some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that it naturally puts passengers in a bad mood. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" Mr Harteveldt said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting, \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Transportation says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents and 1 in 5 flight attendants has experienced a physical incident, the agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts dispute the idea that air travel has declined in quality. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number isn't very significant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The junta pivoted towards Russia, enlisting the help of the Wagner mercenary group, which was at the time linked to the Kremlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wagner has since pulled out of the country, and its operations have been taken over by<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/b00040z2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Africa Corps, which falls under Russia's defence ministry</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the Wagner mercenaries highlighted their atrocities on an invitation-only Telegram group until it was shut down in the middle of this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/the-bear-and-the-bot-farm-countering-russian-hybrid-warfare-in-africa/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said a report released by the European Council on Foreign Relations last month</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They \"regularly shared photos and videos of murder, rape, torture, cannibalism and desecration of corpses against alleged insurgents and civilians\", the report added.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June, the Africa Report publication said it had<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/386622/wagners-red-room-how-russian-mercenaries-flaunt-their-crimes-on-telegram/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> \"infiltrated\" the Wagner-linked Telegram channel</a>, finding 322 videos and 647 photographs of atrocities, including severed heads and gouged-out eyes, and posts \"laced with racism\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shopkeeper we spoke to has fled Mali and is now living in a refugee camp across the border in Mauritania. We have named him Ahmed, and have changed the names of all the victims quoted in this article for their own safety. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC his ordeal started when the Wagner combatants drove up to the big store that he ran in the central town of Nampala in August 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being regular customers, the Wagner fighters wanted to detain his boss, and accused him of colluding with the jihadists who have a strong presence in the region, Ahmed said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They took me to the vehicle and pushed me inside and tied my hands,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A Wagner soldier took a knife and placed it on my finger, and asked me: 'Where is the shop owner?' I told him he is in [the capital] Bamako, but he replied: 'Wrong answer'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed said the Wagner men, who spoke through an interpreter, then took him to a well-fortified Malian military base, and put him in a hangar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I and three Wagner guys were in the hangar. They filled a tank with water and asked me to take off my clothes. I did. They dipped my head in the water until I was almost suffocating and I fell. Then they put their feet on my chest and I started to breathe [heavily].</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Then they dipped my head in the water again and asked me for the second time about the shop owner and I told them he is in Bamako,\" Ahmed said, adding that the torture was repeated for a third time, and he gave the same answer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After this ordeal, Ahmed said he was thrown into a small toilet block, where there were other local people he knew - including Hussein, who had been so badly beaten that he could not recognise him at first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"About 40 minutes later, they brought Umar [another acquaintance]. He too was in a terrible situation. They had tortured him. We slept in that toilet and the next morning they brought a piece of bread and a small cup of coffee,\" Ahmed said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he was taken back to the hangar, where the Russian fighters wrapped a bandage around his face and head. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't see. I couldn't talk. I couldn't hear. They put a knife on my throat and told the interpreter to tell me that this is the last chance. If I didn't tell them the truth, they would behead me. I told the interpreter I had given them all the information I had.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed said his Russian interrogators then removed the bandage and threw him into a kitchen where he spent the night with two strangers - an ethnic Tuareg man who told him he had been detained without being told why while grazing cattle, and an Arab man who said he was picked up while looking for his camels.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fc5/live/381cee70-af50-11f0-8da8-177c6b913c3a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A Tuareg man rides a camel with some goods on it, with another camel in front and at the back, in Mali (archive shot)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nomads criss-cross the desert terrain of northern Mali with their camels</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The nomadic Tuareg and Arab communities who roam the vast deserts of northern Mali are often treated with suspicion, especially since a Tuareg separatist uprising more than a decade ago was hijacked by jihadist groups, who now operate mainly under the banner of an al-Qaeda affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After spending the night with them, Ahmed said he was taken back to the hangar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They brought the two men [the Tuareg and Arab] and beheaded them in my presence,\" Ahmed said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking terrified, Ahmed tried to beat back tears as he told the BBC what happened next. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They brought one of the bodies closer to me to smell the fresh blood, and said: 'If you don't tell us the whereabouts of the shop owner, you will suffer a similar fate.'\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed said his life was only spared after a Wagner commander made a call to a Malian army officer, who assured him that the shop owner was not colluding with the jihadists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed said the commander then went to the base to release him, as well as another shop owner and Umar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I spent 15 days there. Then I decided to leave for Mauritania with my wife and children,\" Ahmed said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached Russia's and Mali's defence ministries for comment, but they have not yet responded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Sentry, a campaign group co-founded by actor George Clooney and former US government official John Prendergast, said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thesentry.org/reports/mercenary-meltdown-wagner-failure-mali/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in a report released in August that Wagner fighters had not only carried out abuses against civilians</a>, but it had also created \"chaos and fear\" within the Malian military hierarchy, forcing commanders to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It quoted a Malian official as saying that Wagner operatives were \"worse than the French. They think my men are more stupid than them.

Local people told her that he had been repeatedly shot while riding his horse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Who is going to look after my children?

And last Tuesday, former Vice-President Kamala Harris visited campaign workers at a canvassing event.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why am I in Tennessee?\" she asked the crowd. \"Because I know the power is in the South.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The district at issue should be reliably conservative. Donald Trump won there by 22 percentage points in last year's presidential election. But both Republicans and Democrats are acting like the race is much closer - and political forecasters agree.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sources roundly agree that Nashville Democrats are ravenous at the prospect of an upset, while many Republican voters are unaware an election is even taking place,\" writes Matthew Klein of the Cook Political Report.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election comes as cracks have appeared in Trump's grip over his party on a number of issues - culminating in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj4qvx08450o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">conservative firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation from Congress</a> on Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter which way the political pendulum swings, Republican or Democrat, nothing ever gets better for the common American man or woman,\" she said in her resignation speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The outcome in Tennessee alone won't flip control of the closely divided House of Representatives. But a Republican loss could prompt a panic within party ranks at a time when Trump is vulnerable and many conservatives are glancing nervously at next year's midterm congressional elections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results could also reveal a shifting political landscape even in the heart of Trump country – and hint at how the Republican Party is slowly coming to grips with a world after Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Republicans are going to have to start thinking about the future,\" said John Geer, a political science professor at Nashville's Vanderbilt University. \"It's going to be hard to do, but at a certain point they're going to see it in their electoral interests.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Key moments from Trump and Greene's public fallout</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tennessee voters are casting ballots less than a month after local elections earlier this month saw a shift towards Democratic candidates running on the economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, Republicans, including Trump,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c231y3dm8jko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> have been scrambling to reshape their message to focus on \"affordability\"</a> – the label Democrats have applied to concerns about high consumer prices and a rising cost of living.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has cut tariffs on grocery items like coffee, bananas, beef and avocados. He has proposed 50-year mortgages and $2,000 tariff rebates to low- and middle- income Americans. But it hasn't been a smooth process, and there have been some signs that Trump's Make America Great Again – Maga – coalition is fraying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During an interview on Fox News last week, Trump sparred with presenter Laura Ingraham over the mortgage proposal, which some conservatives believe will only line the pockets of big banks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also echoed conservative concerns about his support of H1-B visas for foreign workers - which Trump defended as necessary because Americans sometimes lacked \"certain talents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the ground in Tennessee, as it was in recent elections in Virginia and Pennsylvania, bread-and-butter economic issues dominated the conversation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even here, however, there is evidence of conservative dissatisfaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent national poll conducted by Vanderbilt University found that more than 60% of Trump supporters \"disagreed\" with the notion that the cost of living had decreased over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The national mood, when it comes to inflation, cost of living and the economy, is \"very sour\", said Professor Greer,  who is co-director of the Vanderbilt poll.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's genuine unhappiness, partly because Trump made prices an issue,\" Geer noted. \"He said he was going to bring them down, and he hasn't.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Democratic nominee Aftyn Behn has focused almost exclusively on affordability and local quality of life issues</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tennessee is still decidedly Trump terrain. He won the state with 64% of the vote last year and topped 60% the previous two presidential elections. But Republicans appear to be feeling out how to adjust to a changing political environment – one in which the economy is a political liability, as opposed to a means to attack incumbent Democrats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Democratic nominee, state legislator Aftyn Behn, has focused almost exclusively on affordability and local quality of life issues. Her yard signs read: \"Feed kids, fix roads, fund hospitals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her television adverts hit her Republican opponent, Matt Van Epps, for his ties to Washington Republicans, including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson of Louisiana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This campaign has been one about building a coalition of the disenchanted, a coalition of the pissed off,\" she told the BBC during an organising event in Nashville last week. \"If you're upset about the chaos in Washington, if you're upset about the cost of living, then I'm your candidate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Van Epps, in style and substance, is a typical modern Republican candidate. An Army pilot, he served nine tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. His yard sign sports the outline of a Chinook helicopter, the kind he flew on special operations missions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He ran in a crowded primary where loyalty to Trump was a litmus test – and a last-minute endorsement by the president put him over the top.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Van Epps's general election campaign has been a marked contrast. While he held a 20-minute tele-rally with Trump two weeks ago, the candidate doesn't talk about the president much on the campaign trail. Like Behn - and unlike recent Republicans - his advertising hones in on economic, not cultural issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Van Epps campaign did not respond to BBC requests for an interview, but his comments on local television struck a familiar theme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we are moving in a great direction, but we've got work to do,\" he said. \"The cost of living is too high; inflation is still too high.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: US election night’s big winners… in 90 seconds</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The campaign underscores a new reality. While Trump's ballot-box power is unmistakable, his ability to help his fellow Republicans prevail when his name is not on the ballot alongside them is suspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans were drubbed in the 2018 midterms. They underperformed expectations in 2022. They were roundly beaten earlier this month. And barring an arduous constitutional change to remove presidential term limits, Trump's name is never again going to be at the top of the Republican ticket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Republicans, the future after Trump is starting now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Democratic win here in Tennessee next month would be seismic. It could force Republicans to grapple more fully with the costs of sticking with Trump when he is not on the ballot. And it might exacerbate fault lines that are already starting to show within the party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even without such an upset, however, those fault lines are becoming apparent in Washington DC, where Republicans like Greene have become increasingly critical of some of the president's policies – on healthcare, the economy and foreign affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She helped spearhead an effort to force a vote on releasing the Epstein files despite strong opposition from Trump's White House</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at the Republican dinner in Crab Orchard, the Epstein vote happening the same day was absent from the evening's public remarks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked, however, many present acknowledged that the issue of Epstein was important to their constituents – and expressed hope that the vote would allow the party to return focus to other issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Epstein files need to be in the rear view mirror,\" said Chelsea Rose, who was standing in for her husband, Congressman John Rose, who had stayed back in Washington for the Epstein vote. \"Frankly, it's been a distraction for a long time now, and I'm glad for it to be behind us.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How much do Americans care about the Epstein story?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the party divisions on display in Washington, some were more circumspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We support Donald Trump here, and we appreciate what he's doing,\" said Van Hilleary, who represented Tennessee in the House from 1995 to 2003 and is now running for his old seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The challenge for Trump, he continued, is that the measures that he has taken may cause some short-term disruptions and discomfort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've let this thing go so long that the pretty fixes are in a rear view mirror,\" he said. \"I'm afraid what's in front of us are not very elegant, not very pretty fixes, but they have to be done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality, however, is that Trump's sagging popularity, the consequences of some of his more disruptive policies – his \"not very pretty fixes\" and his focus on foreign policy - have put stress on the Republican coalition, even in conservative Tennessee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state's soy bean farmers and cattle ranchers have felt the pinch from tariffs and trade disputes. Looming expiration of health-insurance subsidies will hit low-income Tennesseans hard. And the state has seen the same stubbornly high consumer prices that have plagued the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That hasn't necessarily translated into a lack of support for Trump among his loyal voters in Tennessee, however.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've got this idea out here that everyone that supports Trump is this cult,\" Julia Timson, a schoolteacher who was at the Crab Orchard dinner said. \"No. If he's wrong, he's wrong. But at the same time, I would say, I'm the champion in your corner.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shane Wattenbarger, a construction contractor and longtime friend of Timson's, agreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think he's just a flat-out arrogant prick,\" he said of Trump. \"But for this country, that's what it needs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's electoral magic has been his ability to attract new, disaffected voters while keeping longtime Republicans – even those who think he's arrogant, coarse or wrongheaded at times – in the fold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tennessee, that magic may still be enough to pull the Republican candidate over the finish line. Democrats have had high hopes in the past about special-election surprises on conservative territory only to come up short. But even here, the political ground may be shifting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One of the things that has been common over elections over the last decade is the people have wanted change every time,\" said Geer. \"And so if you want change right now, you'd vote for someone like Aftyn Behn.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

The case also exposed India's deep social divides: this occurred in an affluent enclave, while the victims were mostly from the neighbouring slums of Nithari, home to poor migrant families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two men were convicted of rape and murder and spent years on death row. Moninder Singh Pandher was freed in 2023, with the court eventually finding there to be a lack of evidence. Now his servant is out of jail too, bringing to an end the long judicial process in one of India's most disturbing criminal cases.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/41c0/live/3430b030-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images GREATER NOIDA, INDIA - NOVEMBER 12: 2006 Nithari serial killings accused Surendra Koli walks out of Luksar Jail after being acquitted by the Supreme Court on November 12, 2025 in Greater Noida, India. The case came into the public spotlight in December 2006, when skeletons were found in a drain near a house in Nithari village, Noida. The house belonged to Moninder Singh Pandher, while Surendra Koli worked there as his domestic help. The CBI had registered 16 cases against Koli and Pandher over the rape and killing of girls that had shocked the nation. The Supreme Court bench set aside the conviction of Koli in the last remaining case related to the Nithari killings. He has been acquitted in 12 cases already.(Photo by Sunil Ghosh/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Surinder Koli walked free this month after the Supreme Court overturned his conviction</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC visited Nithari a few days after the judgement, and found that most of the victims' families no longer lived there. Two, who remain in the neighbourhood, said they were trying to come to terms with the court order and wondering - \"if Pandher and Koli didn't, then who killed our children?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In interviews since his release, Moninder Singh Pandher has said he was innocent. Surinder Koli has not been seen in public since leaving prison and has not said anything, but his lawyer Yug Mohit Chaudhry said \"all the evidence against him was fabricated\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After 19 years, in the 13 cases in which he had been sentenced to death, he had already been proven innocent in 12 of them. One case was left, in which five courts had declared him guilty and gave the death sentence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Today, the Supreme Court has overturned those earlier four or five judgments in that case as well… These were extremely serious charges, but all the evidence was fabricated,\" Mr Chaudhry <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thewire.in/law/no-one-killed-the-children-in-nithari\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told</a> PTI news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This poor man was framed to protect some powerful person. Every bit of evidence was fake, not a single piece could justify a conviction… You should ask this question to the CBI [the federal Central Bureau of Investigation], because it is clear that the CBI, despite knowing who the real culprit was, created false evidence against these innocent people and trapped them. Ask these questions to the CBI,\" he added. The CBI has not commented on the acquittal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has sent detailed questions to police in Uttar Pradesh state, where Noida is located, but hasn't received a response yet. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in Nithari are finding it very difficult to come to terms with the verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they are innocent, then how come they were in prison for 18 years?\" asks Sunita Kanaujia, tears rolling down her cheeks. Her 10-year-old daughter Jyoti went missing in the summer of 2005. DNA tests later confirmed that she was among the victims. \"God will not forgive those who killed her,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sunita's husband Jhabbu Lal Kanaujia, who was instrumental in unearthing the serial killings, says he felt utter despair after hearing of Surinder Koli's acquittal and burned all the papers related to the case he had collected over the years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, he worked as a \"press-wallah\" - ironing clothes of the locality's affluent residents - right outside Moninder Singh Pandher's house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For 15 months after his daughter went missing, he visited the police station regularly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When someone goes missing, there's no closure. It becomes a wound. It festers. You always wonder where they are, in what condition?\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold December day in 2006, he was one of the people who climbed down into a sewer to dig out skulls, bones and limbs. The number of skulls, he says, was \"many times higher\" than the 19 cases that went to court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, the questions he keeps asking repeatedly are: \"If they are not guilty, then who is? And what happened to our children then?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The acquittal of the two men has snatched away his sense of closure and opened old wounds. But, he says, he's no longer certain that he has any fight left in him. \"I'm an old man, I'm a broken man,\" he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0bcb/live/681bdb40-c535-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images NOIDA, INDIA - JULY 30: the victim of Nithari case, looking at the picture of his daughter Jyoti in his home in Nithari on July 30, 2025 in Noida, India. The Supreme Court has rejected a total of 14 appeals filed against the acquittal of Surendra Koli, accused in the much-talked-about Nithari case of 2006. Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic help Koli were accused of raping and murdering their neighbours, especially children, in Nithari, Uttar Pradesh. Koli was awarded death penalty by the trial court on September 28, 2010. The high court acquitted Pandher and Koli of the death penalty, holding that the prosecution failed to prove their guilt 'beyond reasonable doubt' and calling it a 'botched' investigation.

They noted it was recorded after he had been in custody for 60 days and \"it appeared he was being tutored\". The presence of the police investigator near him raised serious questions, the judges said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court criticised the police and investigating agencies for carrying out a<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>flawed investigation, marked by \"negligence and delay\" because of which \"the true offender\" had not been identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the investigators had \"opted for the easy course by implicating a poor servant of the house and demonising him\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The order also pointed out that the investigators \"did not look into leads, including the organ-trade angle flagged by a governmental committee\" of the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Reports at the time had suggested that the bodies had been cut with surgical precision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jhabbu Lal says \"unless the erring policemen are arrested, we won't get justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The anger against police in Nithari is not new.

It has also slapped sector-specific levies on Canadian goods, including a 50% levy on metals and 25% on automobiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About three-quarters of Canada's exports are sold to the US, making its economy particularly vulnerable. Carney has noted, however, that due to the duties exemption under the current free trade deal, Canada is facing lower tariffs than other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney's focus has instead been on his pledge to double Canada's non-US exports in the next decade. The prime minister recently made a string of global trips to pitch Canada overseas, including to the United Arab Emirates and on the sidelines of the G20 in South Africa.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Tariff relief measures </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, the Carney government has signalled it will be offering financial relief to sectors impacted by US tariffs as they weather the trade storm. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relief would be welcome by Canada's aluminium producers, who have had to absorb initial tariff-related costs to meet their contractual obligations with US customers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Jean Simard, president and chief executive of the Aluminium Association of Canada, told the BBC that Americans are starting to feel squeezed as their stockpiles of the metal deplete. He noted that the US consumes far more aluminium than it produces, leaving it dependent on imports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Time is on our side and pain is on their side,\" Mr Simard said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can stay the course, and we think it is to the benefit of Canada to take its time and not rush into a deal prematurely.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Carney is still facing pressure from others to reach a resolution quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Madan noted that US tariffs on heavy machinery have been felt deeply in Manitoba and that people in that sector \"are deeply concerned\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition Conservatives have criticised Carney's recent comments, saying he has \"dismissed and derided thousands of job losses as none of his concern\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also accused him of failing to negotiate and deliver a \"win\" for Canada as promised on the campaign trail. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney on Tuesday conceded a \"poor choice of words\" in his weekend remarks about talks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with both the US midterm elections and a review of a long-standing free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico on the horizon for 2026, some hope that a resolution might be on the way. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Sands noted that the Office of the United States Trade Representative will be holding public hearings in early December on the free trade agreement, known as USMCA (or CUSMA in Canada).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said it is likely that both Canada and the US will hear from business organisations who want to see free trade continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It could help set the table for Carney to say the \"private sector says they want a deal. What can we do?\" said Mr Sands.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Until recently, he was mostly known for discussions of budgets, supplies and staff issues in the military's largest branch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll does not appear to have a long history of dealing with Russia and Ukraine, or experience in international diplomacy, and has never held public office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, who is this increasingly prominent figure within the administration?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Close ally of Vice-President JD Vance</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is Driscoll's relationship with the now-vice president, JD Vance, that brought him into Trump's orbit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like his friend Vance, Driscoll attended a public university before joining the US Army, and then earned his law degree at the prestigious Yale University. Both men also worked in finance after graduating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his military career, Driscoll became an officer in 2007, led a cavalry platoon and deployed to Iraq for several months in 2009. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has told the story of meeting Vance through a veterans' student group at law school, during which Vance reassured new students that they would at first feel as if they did not belong, but would excel at classes after a few months. Soon, Vance became Driscoll's friend and mentor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll was on holiday with his family in Switzerland in the summer of 2024 when Vance called to tell him he was going to be Trump's running mate and asked him to join the campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next day, Driscoll flew back to the US, bought a suit at an outlet mall, and took an Uber to the Republican National Convention, he told the alumni magazine for the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - the institution where he was an undergraduate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once Trump returned to office, Driscoll was swiftly approved as army secretary in his Senate confirmation vote. His sphere of influence expanded after he became a key figure in Trump's deployment of the National Guard to US cities.

Trump was instead relying on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to work on a plan for a ceasefire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When details of a 28-point plan drafted by the US and Russia <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">were leaked last week</a>, Ukraine immediately voiced concern at some of its key points - and its European allies followed suit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll then made an unannounced visit to Ukraine along with other high-ranking Pentagon figures, the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. The purpose, according to a US Army spokesman, was to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll met Zelensky and was then, according to Politico, feted at a reception at the US ambassador's residence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In subsequent days, Driscoll participated in more discussions with Ukrainian officials in Geneva alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and helped draw up an<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3zwy808dpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> \"updated and refined peace framework\"</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to hold talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said in an effort to finalise the peace plan, he had directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

A former professor has suggested Driscoll aimed \"to serve in the military, go to law school and be in politics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the possibility Driscoll could step officially into the role of negotiating with Ukraine when Trump's special envoy to the country, Keith Kellogg, leaves in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Or he could stay as the head of hundreds of thousands of troops in the US Army. Driscoll has previously highlighted that his father and grandfather served in the military before him, and he often speaks about his vision of transforming the Army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days before heading to Ukraine, Driscoll described to The Conversation podcast how he imagined the near future, when \"every infantryman...will carry a drone into battle\" and soldiers would rely on artificial intelligence because human brains will not be able to \"keep up\" with the pace of action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our window to change is right now,\" he said in a speech in October. \"And we will win with silicon and software, not our soldiers' blood and bodies.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
