No getting back Obama given Crimea (12 years ago, without a shot being fired!), and NO GOING INTO NATO BY UKRAINE. Some things never change!!!\" Trump added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before Trump's return to power in January, Nato countries agreed on Kyiv's \"irreversible path\" to membership in the alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, alongside European leaders including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, will join Zelensky in Washington for talks on Ukraine's future on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also attending are French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. It is unclear how many of them will go to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump later added: \"Big day at the White House tomorrow. Never had so many European Leaders at one time. My great honor to host them!!!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky posted on social media saying he was \"grateful\" for Trump's invitation. \"We all share a strong desire to end this war quickly and reliably\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also doubled down on the need for effective security guarantees from allies, \"not like it was years ago... when Ukraine was given so called 'security guarantees' in 1994 but they didn't work\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Of course, Crimea should not have been given up then,\" he added. \"Just as Ukrainians did not give up Kyiv, Odesa, or Kharkiv after 2022\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For so many heads of state to travel with such little notice across the Atlantic to what is essentially a wartime crisis meeting appears without precedent in the modern era, underscoring the sky-high stakes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Diplomatic sources say European officials are concerned that Trump may try to press Zelensky to agree to terms, after the Ukrainian leader was excluded from the Trump-Putin meeting on US soil last Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the BBC's US partner CBS that any suggestion Zelensky might be bullied by Trump into accepting a peace deal was a \"stupid media narrative\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">February's row between Zelensky, Vance and Trump</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nato leaders also appear eager to avoid a repeat of Zelensky's February trip to the Oval Office that ended abruptly after an argument with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The altercation - which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of \"gambling with World War Three\" - left Washington-Kyiv ties in tatters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But European leaders have been working diligently behind the scenes since then to mend the relationship. The Ukrainian leader has been coached to talk in terms of deal-making - language that resonates with Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In April, Ukraine signed a minerals agreement that gave the US a financial stake in the country, and Trump and Zelensky spoke privately at the Vatican before Pope Francis's funeral. Ukraine made clear it was willing to pay for US weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By July, the two leaders had a phone call that the Ukrainian president described as \"the best conversation we have had\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Trump had begun to express exasperation with Russia's unrelenting onslaught in Ukraine. He called Putin \"absolutely crazy\", drastically shortened his deadline for a peace deal, and threatened economic sanctions on Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As these deliberations grind on, Russian forces continue to advance on the battlefield.  They now occupy almost a fifth of Ukraine since Moscow launched its full scale invasion in February 2022.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6215/live/851b0780-7bba-11f0-83cc-c5da98c419b8.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"EPA European Commission President Ursula van der Leyen and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky attend a video conference with EU leaders in Brussels, Belgium, on 17 August 2025\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Zelensky joined a virtual summit on Sunday with Nato and European leaders</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A virtual summit was held on Sunday between Zelensky and the so-called coalition of the willing - a group of nations including the UK, France and Germany that have pledged to protect peace in Ukraine once it is achieved.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Afterwards, Emmanuel Macron told reporters their plan was to \"present a united front\" for Monday's talks with Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky and the Nato leaders said they were keen to learn more after US envoy Steve Witkoff told US television that Putin had agreed on Friday to \"robust security guarantees that I would describe as game-changing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Witkoff said such an agreement could see Europe and the US protect Ukraine from further aggression with a Nato-like defence agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were able to win the following concession: that the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in Nato,\" Witkoff told CNN on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin has long opposed Ukraine joining Nato, and Witkoff said the arrangement could be an alternative if the Ukrainians \"can live with it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Article 5 is a principle at the heart of the 32-member transatlantic military alliance that says its members will come to the defence of an ally that is under attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Witkoff also told CNN that Russia made \"some concessions\" around five heavily contested regions of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In talks with European allies after the Alaska summit, Trump said Putin had reiterated that he wants the key Donetsk and Luhansk regions that make up Donbas, eastern Ukraine, according to European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But at Sunday's virtual summit with Nato leaders, Zelensky stressed that the Ukrainian constitution makes it impossible to give up territory - and that this should only be discussed by the leaders of Ukraine and Russia at a trilateral summit with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US secretary of state, meanwhile, sought to temper hopes that a deal to end Europe's deadliest conflict for 80 years could be imminent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We're still a long ways off,\" Rubio said on Sunday.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is quite possible that Monday's meeting in the White House could prove even more crucial to the future of Ukraine - and for all of Europe's security - than last Friday's US-Russia summit in Alaska. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the surface, that Putin-Trump reunion seemed to live down to every expectation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There was no ceasefire, no sanctions, no grand announcements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Were Ukraine and Europe about to get cut out of a deal cooked up behind closed doors by the world's two foremost nuclear powers?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not, apparently, if Ukraine and its partners can prevent it. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The presence of Sir Keir Starmer, President Macron, Chancellor Merz and other leaders alongside President Zelensky in Washington is about more than making sure he does not get ambushed in the Oval Office again, in the way he did on 28 February. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are determined to impress upon Donald Trump two things: firstly, that there can be no peace deal for Ukraine without Ukraine's direct involvement and secondly, that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crm4ln2ekg1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">it must be backed by 'cast-iron' security guarantees</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Above all, Europe's leaders want the US President to see that Ukraine and Europe present a united front and they are eager to ensure he is not being swayed by his obvious personal rapport with Vladimir Putin into giving in to the Russian leaders' demands.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: How the Trump-Putin summit unfolded... in under 2 minutes</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This is where the Sir Keir Starmer's diplomatic skills will be sorely tested. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump likes Starmer and listens to him, and in a month's time Trump will be coming to the UK on a state visit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also likes Mark Rutte, the NATO Secretary-General who will be in attendance, a man who is sometimes called 'the Trump Whisperer'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US President appears to be less fond of President Macron and the White House was sharply critical recently of his intention to unconditionally recognise a Palestinian state at the next UN General Assembly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a peace deal in Ukraine to have any chance of working, something has to give.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">European leaders have said frequently that international borders cannot be changed by force and President Zelensky has said time and time again he will not give up land and besides, Ukraine's constitution forbids it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Putin wants the Donbas, which his forces already control around 85 per cent of, and he has absolutely no intention of ever handing back Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet as the former Estonian PM and now Europe's top diplomat Kaja Kallas once said to me: victory for Ukraine in this war does not have to be exclusively about reconquering occupied land. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If Ukraine can obtain the sort of Article 5-type security guarantees now being talked about, sufficient to deter any future Russian aggression and thereby safeguard its independence as a free and sovereign state, then that would be a form of victory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It does now appear that what the US and Russia have been discussing is a proposal that broadly trades some Ukrainian land for security guarantees that it won't have to give up any more to Russia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question marks are huge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Could Ukraine accept a deal that ends the war but costs it land, especially when so many thousands have died trying to save that land? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If it is asked to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgv1pdkll8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">give up the remaining 30 per cent of Donetsk Oblast</a> that Russia has yet to occupy then does that leave the path westwards to Kyiv dangerously under-defended?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And what of Starmer's much-vaunted Coalition of the Willing? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier talk of deploying tens of thousands of boots on the ground have since been scaled back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now it's more about 'safeguarding skies and seas' while helping Ukraine to rebuild its army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But even if peace does break out on the battlefield we are still in dangerous territory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Every military expert I have spoken to believes that the moment the fighting stops Putin will reconstitute his army, build more weapons, until he is in a position, perhaps in as little as three to four years, to grab more land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If and when that happens it will be a brave Typhoon or F35 pilot who is prepared to fire that first missile on an advancing Russian column.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Ronnie was not just a legend, he was legendary and will be deeply missed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rondell retired in 2001, but earned his final stunt credit for The Matrix Reloaded in 2003 - taking part in a complex car chase scene. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was given a lifetime achievement honour at the Taurus World Stunt Awards in 2004. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rondell was not the only performer in the family.

It says its forces target terrorists and never civilians, and claims that Hamas is responsible for the humanitarian crisis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 60,000 people have been killed since the start of Israel's war in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

What land was to be swapped? Was Ukraine to be offered part of Russia, in exchange for the land Russia had taken by force?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to travel to Washington on Monday to meet Trump, there is likely no \"swap\" element to the US president's thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, he is reportedly planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line – a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Luhansk is already almost entirely under Russian control. But Ukraine is estimated to have held onto about 30% of Donetsk, including several key cities and fortifications, at a cost of tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both regions – known together as Donbas – are rich in minerals and industry. To surrender them to Russia now would be a \"tragedy\", said the Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Hrytsak.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is Ukrainian territory,\" Mr Hrytsak said. \"And the people of these regions – particularly the miners – played a huge role in the strengthening of the Ukrainian identity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The region had also produced \"famous politicians, poets and dissidents\", he said. \"And now refugees who will not be able to return home if it becomes Russian.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the Donbas since Russian aggression began in 2014. More than three million are estimated to be living under Russian occupation. A further 300,000 are estimated to be in the parts where Ukraine still has control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In areas closest to the front line, life is already a dangerous struggle. Andriy Borylo, a 55-year-old military chaplain in the badly hit city of Sloviansk, said in a phone interview that shells had landed next to his house over the weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is a very difficult situation here,\" he said. \"There is a feeling of resignation and abandonment. I don't know how much we have the strength to endure. Someone has to protect us. But who?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Borylo had been following the news from Alaska, he said. \"I put this on Trump, not Zelensky. But they are taking everything from me, and it is a betrayal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky has consistently said Ukraine would not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace. And confidence in Russia to abide by any such arrangement – rather than simply use the annexed land for future attacks – is low.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For that and other reasons, about 75% of Ukrainians object to any formal cessation of land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Residents step out of their car to take in the devastation of residential buildings bombed by Russian forces on August 10, 2025 in Kramatorsk, Ukraine\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Ukraine is estimated to have held onto about 30% of the Donetsk region, including several key cities and fortifications</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Ukraine is also deeply fatigued by war. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed and wounded since the full-scale invasion began. People are craving an end to suffering, particularly in the Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You ask about the surrender of the Donetsk region, well, I measure this war not in kilometres but in human lives,\" said Yevhen Tkachov, 56, an emergency rescue worker in the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm not ready to give tens of thousands of lives for several thousand square kilometres,\" he said. \"Life is more important than territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For some, this is what it comes down to in the end. Land versus life. It leaves President Zelensky \"at a crossroads with no good route in front of him\", said Volodmyr Ariev, a Ukrainian MP from the opposition European Solidarity party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't have enough forces to continue the war for an unlimited time,\" Ariev said. \"But if Zelensky were to concede this land it would be not only a breakdown of our constitution, it could have the hallmarks of treason.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, it is not clear in Ukraine by what mechanism such an agreement could even be reached. Any formal handover of the nation's territory requires the approval of the parliament and a referendum of the people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More likely would be a de-facto surrender of control, with no formal recognition of the territory as Russian. But even in that event, the process is not well understood, said Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no real understanding as to what the procedure should be,\" she said. \"Does the president simply sign the agreement? Does it have to be the government? The parliament? There is no legal procedure set up because, you know, the constitution writers didn't think about this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Things may become more clear after Zelensky speaks with Trump in Washington on Monday – the Ukrainian leader's first visit to the White House since a disastrous clash in the Oval Office in February. Amid the unhappiness left by the Alaska summit, there was one possible glimmer of good news for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump appeared to reverse his position on security guarantees after the summit, suggesting he was ready to join Europe in offering Ukraine military protection from future Russian attacks.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: How the Trump-Putin summit unfolded... in under 2 minutes</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukrainians, polling shows security guarantees are an absolutely vital part of any potential agreement on territory or anything else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People in Ukraine will accept various forms of security guarantees,\" said Anton Grushchetsky, the director of Kyiv's International Institute for Sociology, \"but they require them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Yevhen Tkachov, the emergency worker in Kramatorsk, exchange of territory could only be considered with \"real guarantees, not just written promises\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Only then, more or less, I am in favour of giving Donbas to Russia,\" he said. \"If the British Royal Navy is stationed in the port of Odesa, then I agree.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As various paths to peace are floated and discussed, sometimes in the deal-making style preferred by President Trump, there is a risk of losing sight of the real people involved – people who have already lived through a decade of war and who may stand to lose even more now in exchange for peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Donbas was a place full of Ukrainians from all different walks of life, said Vitalii Dribnytsia, a Ukrainian historian. \"We are not just talking about culture, about politics, about demographics, we are talking about people,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Donetsk might not have the cultural reputation of somewhere like Odesa, Mr Drinytsia said. But it was Ukraine. \"And any corner of Ukraine, regardless of whether it has some great cultural significance or not, is Ukraine,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-daria-mitiuk.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by Daria Mitiuk.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And nowhere is this clearer than in Singapore, where ethnically Chinese people make up more than three-quarters of the multicultural population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trend is not surprising given that Chinese soft power seems to be on the rise – think viral Labubu dolls, humanoid robots and futuristic cities that are impressing travellers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Centuries-old and sophisticated, Chinese cooking is not among Beijing's list of priorities for turning the country into \"a powerhouse in culture\" by 2035.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, as an increasingly authoritarian China tries hard to win the world over, a sumptuous table may just be its most effective, and underrated, draw.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">First stop: Singapore</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Luckin, China's answer to Starbucks, opened its first overseas store in Singapore in March 2023. Two years on, there are more than 60. Last month, the chain made its US debut with two New York stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five major Chinese brands, Luckin included, currently run 124 outlets in Singapore, double the number they owned in 2023. It's hard to miss the evidence: huge, bright ads of chilli-laced dishes and, sometimes, Chinese idioms, in malls, buses and subway stations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From established chains to mom-and-pop stores and chic restaurants that challenge tired stereotypes, they have all been taking off here before leapfrogging further afield, to elsewhere in South East Asia and then across the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Succeeding in Singapore is \"a proof of concept for later expansion, convincing potential investors that the chain is ready to go global,\" says Thomas DuBois, a historian of modern China.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Singapore's Liang Seah Street is chock-a-block with Chinese food</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's an easy enough place for new restaurants to set up shop. And it is diverse, which makes it a great test kitchen for very different palates, from South Asian to European.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And importantly, Singapore is a travel hub where, Mr Dubois says, eating is almost like a national pastime: \"People go to Singapore to eat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And what they will find is menus that go beyond the ubiquitous dumplings and hot pot. The entrepreneurs behind the new Chinese culinary wave want to show people just how vast and diverse China is. And they cannot fake it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the visitors to Singapore are ethnic Chinese – not just from China, but from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Jakarta and so on – with a sophisticated understanding of Chinese cuisine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no one kind of fiery, says Claire Wang, the marketing manager for Nong Geng Ji, a chain from Hunan in central China, which is famous for its spicy dishes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hunan's fare has \"a tangy aftertaste achieved through fermented chilli peppers\", she says, unlike \"Sichuan's numbing-spicy or Guizhou's sour-spicy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After launching more than 100 restaurants in China, Nong Geng Ji opened its first overseas stop in Singapore in late 2023. It has since set up six more here, five in Malaysia, one in Canada, and is now eyeing opportunities in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's certainly proof of the growing appetite for chillies, especially the Chinese kind – a trend that would please China's former leader Mao Zedong. Born and raised in Hunan, he believed, \"You can't be a revolutionary if you don't eat chillies\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Finally, 'proper' Chinese food</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the less revolutionary among us, there is plenty more on the table: steamed buns, red meats, preserved vegetables, rice, seasonal stir-fries and delicately-flavoured seafood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's quite the spread compared to the \"Chinese food\" much of the world has become used to, especially in the West – food cooked up by Chinese immigrants in the 19th and 20th Centuries, whose scrubby, nondescript restaurants were often seen as low-brow.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A crowded street of restaurants and bars in New York City's Chinatown.

Ms Dunlop, a British food writer, has spent her career cooking in China's kitchens and studying its food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there is the stereotype, dubbed the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, a partly xenophobic myth that the food can make people feel sick because of supposedly high concentration of additives, particularly the flavouring agent MSG. New research suggests MSG does not make you sick, and while older Chinese restaurants probably used shortcuts to flavour, they were hardly unique in using additives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, a growing diaspora is making it possible for Chinese restaurants to stay true to their roots, knowing they have customers demanding \"proper Chinese food\". And that has coincided with more adventurous palates in the world's biggest cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Thomas Tao was a student in New York in the 2010s, he says he rarely came across Chinese fine-dining, but Americans were very willing to pay for, say, Japanese sashimi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now he is the vice-president of the Green Tea Restaurant chain, which has more than 400 outlets in China serving fresh seafood and savoury soups from Zhejiang. It will open its first outpost in Singapore later this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it goes beyond food, with \"immersive\" restaurants.

Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">type 2 diabetes</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

(A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango.

Pair them with protein or fibre, and avoid combining with other carbs or sugary forms, such as juices and milkshakes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beyond its metabolic impact, the mango occupies a far larger place in Indian life - a fruit that opens doors both literally and figuratively, carrying cultural, social and even diplomatic significance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mango diplomacy\" is a familiar phrase across the subcontinent, where carefully chosen crates of the fruit can grease political deals, strengthen alliances or smooth over tense negotiations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a008/live/db8d3100-78e6-11f0-85e4-03ebbfd01895.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images  Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen (L) hands a basket of Indian mangoes to US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns at a ceremony celebrating the opening of mango trade between the United States and India at the Commerce Department in Washington 01 May 2007. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Former Indian Ambassador Ronen Sen presents a basket of Indian mangoes to the then US Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns during a 2007 ceremony</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mango festivals pop up across Indian cities, celebrating the fruit's cultural and economic significance. The fruit is, at once, a favourite indulgence and a quietly powerful social currency. \"Most Indians have a personal favourite mango and parochial regional loyalties have long fuelled heated ranking debates,\" says Pushpesh Pant, a Delhi-based historian and culinary expert.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Good mangoes are not just to be eaten; they are adornments like jewellery. The rules of the mango push the best produce towards those willing to pay the highest price,\" writes Sopan Joshi in Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, a magisterial account of the fruit and its admirers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are more than 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India. Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering. Poet Ghalib called the mango a \"a sealed glass of honey\", and hundreds of books have been written celebrating its allure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Part indulgence, part icon, the mango continues to delight and inspire - now with a surprising nod from science.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was a rare example of a failed summit coming as a relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the absence of any real developments, attention in Ukraine turned to the presentational aspects of the summit – the \"optics\", in political speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin, the man responsible for the devastating war of aggression against Ukraine, had received the warmest welcome possible in Alaska. American soldiers knelt to literally roll out the red carpet for him. Trump applauded him as he approached and offered a friendly handshake. The two leaders rode together alone in Trump's presidential limousine and Putin could be seen laughing as the car pulled away.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the Russian president, who has been shunned internationally since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the greeting marked the beginning of a remarkable return to the global diplomatic stage and set a tone that would continue throughout the day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Ukraine, it was not a welcome sight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Red carpets and this level of ceremony are normal at international events, but in this case – for an aggressor responsible for the deaths of millions – it should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova, 40, a lawyer in the capital Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Drachova, who woke up and watched the footage over breakfast, said it appeared as though \"the entire event was staged to please Putin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The rational world is behaving irrationally by giving him this welcome,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"It should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova of the warm welcome for Putin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin's plane had been escorted into the airbase in Alaska by four American fighter jets and as he strolled down the red carpet, talking jovially with Trump, an American B-2 bomber flew overhead flanked by four more jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainians who had stayed up late to watch the spectacle were seeing the \"legitimisation of a war criminal at the highest level\", said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian writer and political analyst.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There was no need for this pomp at all,\" Kovalenko said. \"This is a meeting that should have been conducted in a much more restrained way – minimalistic, without this level of respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the greetings, Trump and Putin sat down in front of a gaggle of reporters at Elmendorf Air Force Base, under a banner that read \"Pursuing Peace\".

Russian troops quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv and seized huge swathes of the south, including big chunks of two more oblasts, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The war has ebbed and flowed ever since. Russia now controls rather less territory - down from about 27% in the spring of 2022 to around 20% now. In the east, Russian forces are advancing, but very slowly and at great cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now. European allies also insist on a halt in fighting. US President Donald Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin,  Trump has talked instead about territorial swaps. That has sent shockwaves across Kyiv and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows:</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Kyiv, such a concession would be a bitter pill to swallow. For Moscow, whose losses have been even more catastrophic, it would be seen as victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine \"could not\" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pushing hard, and making progress, near the town of Dobropillya. But it's not yet clear whether this marks a significant strategic move or just an effort to show Trump that Moscow has the upper hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What about Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, captured in 2022? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here, it's reported, Russia is offering to halt its offensive and freeze the lines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But would Russia be prepared to give any of it back? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Trump talked vaguely about \"ocean-front property\" – presumably a reference to some of this shoreline, along the Sea of Azov or Black Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is all part of Putin's strategically vital land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's hard to see the Russian leader agreeing to give any of it up. Like Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin regards these places as part of Russia, and illegally annexed them three years ago in four referendums widely regarded as a sham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine, and Europe, territorial swaps – at this very early stage of the talks – are a non-starter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A discussion about future borders may eventually come, but only when the war has stopped and Ukraine's security has been guaranteed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It however expected several days of disruption before scheduling returned to normal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline has warned that some flights would be cancelled over the next seven to 10 days and said that it \"deeply regrets\" customer inconvenience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It said that those affected would be contacted and provided a new itinerary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline added that customers in Canada were not eligible for compensation for delayed or cancelled flights because the strike action was out of its control.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why was the strike called off? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unionised workers were forced to end the strike after the government ordered a binding arbitration to end the dispute. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">CIRB told staff to return to return to work by 14:00 EDT (18:00 GMT) and said that a collective agreement that expired on 31 March would be extended until a new one was agreed, Air Canada said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why did Air Canada cancel flights?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Air Canada suspended \"all operations\" due to a flight attendants' strike that began Saturday, the federal government stepped in to force both parties to the bargaining table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The attendants gave a 72-hour strike notice earlier this week, after contract talks reached an impasse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their union said the company was not addressing key issues such as wages and unpaid work, and the strike took effect shortly after midnight on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soon afterwards, the carrier began delaying and cancelling some flights. On Friday, it expected to scrap 500 flights, affecting 100,000 passengers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With the strike in effect, the airline announced it would halt flights on its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the cancellations mounted, the Canadian government used its powers to force the airline and the union into binding arbitration, in an effort to minimise disruptions for travel and the economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline, which operates in 64 countries and has a fleet of 259 aircraft, warned that a \"complete cessation of flying\" would begin on Saturday, if the labour issues were not resolved. Air Canada Express flights, which carry about 20% of Air Canada's daily customers, are not affected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Still, a shutdown could affect 130,000 daily customers, including 25,000 Canadians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Upon receiving the strike notice, Air Canada issued its own 72-hour lock-out notice and began winding down operations, delaying and cancelling flights over those three days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chief Operations Officer Mark Nasr explained the airline's system was complex and not something \"we can start or stop at the push of a button\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: Moment Air Canada ends news conference after union activists disrupt event</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What led to the strike?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Cupe union has asserted that it bargained in good faith with the airline for more than eight months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline said it recently offered flight attendants a 38% increase in total compensation over four years, with a 25% raise in the first year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the union said the offer was \"below inflation, below market value, below minimum wage\" and would leave flight attendants unpaid for some hours of work, including waiting at airports ahead of flights or during the boarding process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They said wages had not kept up with inflation, so Air Canada's suggested pay increase was \"in effect, a pay cut\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Almost all of the attendants - 99.7% - voted to strike earlier this month. The company asked the government to intervene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Government representatives had facilitated some of the negotiations already, but the carrier went further and asked Canada's jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, to refer the matter for binding arbitration.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How did the government respond to the strike? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday,  Hajdu ordered Air Canada and Cupe into binding arbitration by invoking Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Despite significant supports from the government, these parties have been unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner,\" Hadju said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I am exercising this authority because it is critical to maintaining and securing industrial peace, protecting Canadians and promoting conditions to resolve the dispute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cupe has responded by accusing the of Liberal Party of \"violating our charter rights\". They allege that forcing a bargain to end the strike will \"ensure unresolved issues will continue to worsen by kicking them down the road\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, Air Canada proposed having a third party step in to develop an agreement through what is called \"binding arbitration\", but the union rejected this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It then asked the government to force the parties into binding arbitration, pointing to recent government interventions in negotiations in the rail and port sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In binding arbitration, an independent third party sets the terms of a contract in an agreement that is legally enforceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The union said in a statement on Friday that it had requested that Hajdu not intervene and, instead, allow \"the parties to reach a resolution through free and fair negotiations, without undue interference\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There was growing pressure from other parts of Canada, as well. The Board of Trade for the Toronto region had called<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>for government intervention, while the province of  Newfoundland and Labrador released a statement describing the impact of a strike as \"catastrophic\" for the tourism industry during the summer season.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What to do if your flight is cancelled</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Air Canada has said it will notify passengers if there is a change to the flight's scheduled departure time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Customers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and will receive a full refund, the airline said. The company has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide customers alternative travel options.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If it's a round trip, return flights are not automatically cancelled in case the passengers reaches the destination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those bookings can be cancelled with no fees.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
