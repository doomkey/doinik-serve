He has been released from hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks. Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>of the recent<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute <b id=\"-\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">- </b>making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.</p><p

When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57303592\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">up to three children</a> per couple in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpk7r8w9yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new 13% tax on contraceptives</a> - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57154574\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">other factors</a> - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

the big powers have stronger leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He suggested the UN Security Council -

Hundreds of Palestinians were killed trying to access food at GHF sites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked if he saw the UN as powerless in Gaza where it should have made a difference, he said: \"Of course, but let's be clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For a long time, Israel was saying that humanitarian aid was not distributed because the UN was not able to do so. Of course, whenever Israel would not allow us to move into Gaza, we couldn't move into Gaza.

I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">made comments</a> suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: \"We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been \"definitely to slow down global activity\", he added that there \"have been other things that have been more than offsetting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by \"tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it said risks to the global outlook \"remain tilted to the downside\", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that \"trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada.

Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz68lglg5vlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">five fatal shark attacks</a> in the country last year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

What do they think of the state of the economy? Are their lives better today than they were a year ago?  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People from across the US and the political spectrum told the BBC about setting food budgets, applying for jobs and more.

Gas was really, really bad and then we had problems with getting food trucked in because I live in a rural area, so prices shot up real crazy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where other people were complaining about $7 (£5.23) eggs, we had $11 (£8.22) eggs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some days it was like deciding whether the dogs ate or I ate. I'm on social security and I have a budget and I'm allowed food stamps, but I only get $24 a month and that doesn't buy a whole lot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's much better now, it's like night and day. We're aiming in a better place these days, things have completely come around from where we were a year ago. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Anthony Landaeta, 33, Minnesota</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"an-independent-voter,-this-father-of-an-18-month-old-boy-has-cut-down-his-food-budget-after-he-discovered-the-shockingly-steep-price-tag-for-childcare.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"an-independent-voter,-this-father-of-an-18-month-old-boy-has-cut-down-his-food-budget-after-he-discovered-the-shockingly-steep-price-tag-for-childcare.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">An independent voter, this father of an 18-month-old boy has cut down his food budget after he discovered the shockingly-steep price tag for childcare. </b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It feels like the price of everything is rising. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Childcare costs are about $25,000 per year, which really surprised me. My parents might retire next year, which could help. I work as an engineer in data centres and my wife is an airline pilot, and neither of us want to quit our job to take care of kids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It feels like Trump doesn't tell the truth about almost anything, so it's hard to know how the economy is actually doing. I'd grade him a 4 out of 10 for the economy, because he talks about it more than he actually does anything to help it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shrinkflation drives me crazy. We bought baby formula, a 32oz bottle, and then a little later when we went to buy it again it came in a 24oz bottle.

I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are \"marginally ahead\" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that.

eZyhnA\">\"It's no small feat to get a shoe out of an alligator,\" Shepherd told a crowd of Claude's fans in Golden Gate Park.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It took a lot of anaesthesia, specialised tools, and multiple vets and staff members to extract the shoe from inside Claude - a task that was completed successfully, despite a fire alarm going off throughout the building at the time, Shepherd said. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

sculptures and art works in honour of Osun and other deities,\" Unesco says on its website. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The sacred grove, which is now seen as a symbol of identity for all

added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun was one of those helping to safeguard the forest from misuse, even confronting and getting into scrapes with those trying to fish in the sacred River Osun, where such activities were prohibited, to preserve the pristine environment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The river is the focus of the annual Osun Osogbo Festival, which attracts

very, very active role in the making of the art masters. Those were the people who sacrificed their lives and time, [and] gave devotion, energy and soul to the mission of Osun Osogbo and Nigeria.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun was one of those people. His actual date of birth appears to be unknown, but he was born around 1945 into the Arelagbayi lineage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wood carving was a family tradition, but by the time of Akangbe Ogun's birth, it had skipped two generations. At the very start of primary school, his education was truncated by his father's death. He eventually started learning carpentry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun reflected later in life: \"I only spent one week in school, but I lecture university students in the US. I am good at picking up languages. I have travelled a lot, and it's all thanks to art.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was working in the grove, on the Iledi Ontooto shrine roof, when Susanne Wenger, the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7595841.stm\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Austrian-Nigerian artist and Yoruba priestess, </a>said to him: \"It is wood carving you'll be doing.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She told him his work was distinctive, different - and he held on to that to the end of his days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Wenger wrote in 1990: \"Akangbe, bodily and spiritually voluminous, creates works of an ethereal, sublimely weightless loftiness. His work is a primary eruption of genius.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Molara Wood Kasali Akangbe Ogun, dressed in a colourful green outfit, is sitting on the floor and doing a carving\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Molara Wood</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Despite his fame, Kasali Akangbe Ogun led a simple life</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on behalf of the Adunni Olorisha Trust, Akinsanya said the carver's \"craftsmanship is visible in the ritual figures, majestic pillars, and beautifully crafted roofs adorning many of the shrines\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun exhibited widely, including at: Iwalewa Haus, Bayreuth, Germany (1989); Africa Centre, London (1990); Edinburgh Fringe (1994); and in the New Sacred Art Movement show at Quintessence, Lagos (2009). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He exhibited – and executed commissions – at the National Black Theatre in Harlem in the US, all through the 1990s, working with the theatre's founder, Barbara Ann Teer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the invitation of historian Akinwunmi Ogundiran, the carver was Distinguished Africana Artist-in-Residence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, US, in 2013.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ogundiran wrote that Akangbe Ogun's works \"transcend the traditional boundaries of sculpture, structural design, folklore, and environmental preservation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his tribute, curator and art consultant Moses Ohiomokhare said: \"I mourn the loss of this great artist, a master wood carver and an extraordinary person.
