It comes after Trump threatened Colombia with military action. He said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached the White House for comment. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98py70npj9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future</a>. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations, and has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration says it<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ljjd5rwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025</a>. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials said the woman,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Renee Nicole Good</a>, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlz7r0zrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">after a CIA source in Venezuelan government</a> helped the US track his location.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gustavo Petro said Colombia preferred dialogue with the US, but added the country's history showed \"how it has responded to large armies\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" adding: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro denied the claims, saying it has \"always been proven that I'm not involved in that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a \"total peace\" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described \"two simultaneous approaches.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, \"where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred\" and \"where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most.\" Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to \"de-escalate violence\", adding: \"we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Life here has become unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The biggest protests since the Islamic revolution took place in 2009, when millions of Iranians took to the streets of major cities after a disputed presidential election. Dozens of opposition supporters killed and thousands were detained in the ensuing crackdown.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's home in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU immediately cast serious doubt on whether the strike had ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik there were 13 ballistic missiles that targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit – in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

(ICE) agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People have taken to the streets of Minneapolis to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, who died on Wednesday after being shot in her car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials from involvement in the case, but the US vice-president said the investigation is a federal issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials have offered differing accounts of the incident, with the Trump administration claiming the ICE agent was acting in self defence, while local officials say the woman posed no danger.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has claimed the ICE agent shot Good multiple times because she was trying to run over the officer in her car. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would investigate the incident. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) said the FBI had initially agreed to a joint investigation with state officials but then reversed course and denied the state access to materials and evidence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the ability to access all the necessary case materials and evidence, the BCA has \"reluctantly withdrawn\" from the investigation, the BCA's superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation,\" Walz said. \"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vice President JD Vance told reporters on Thursday that the investigation into the shooting was a federal issue, arguing it would go against precedent for a local official to be involved in prosecuting the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car which is in the middle of the street, and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the vehicle attempts to drive off, one of the agents points their gun at the driver and several shots are heard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The car then continues to drive away from the officer and crashes into the side of the street. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the scene of the crash on Thursday, blood from the shooting could still be seen in the snow. People set up a vigil at the site to honour Good, lining the bank with candles and roses. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of demonstrators showed up throughout the day, shouting insults at ICE and offering their neighbours coffee on the cold winter day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Susie Hawyard, a minister, said she went to the scene of the shooting as soon as she heard the news to verify \"with my own eyes\" what happened. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d693/live/5da8c990-ecd4-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Eloise Alanna/BBC A man and woman hug near the site of the Minneapolis shooting\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Eloise Alanna/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Members of the community have been gathering to pay their respects to Good</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was horrified,\" she said. \"I saw the car, I saw Renee's car, I saw Renee's blood.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protesters also gathered at a federal building in Minneapolis early Thursday morning, where they were met with armed officers. The protests remained largely peaceful there, as residents expressed their anger over the killing of Good. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They cannot get away with killing someone. There has to be consequences for actions,\" said Gavin, one of dozens of people outside the federal building. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those who knew Good said she was a poet and guitarist who had just moved to the city of Minneapolis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life.

His supporters saw him as a pan-Africanist, who supported causes such as the campaign against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To his critics, he was a dictator who oversaw numerous human rights abuses until he was driven from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barre initially fled to Kenya, but Moi's government came under intense pressure from parliament and rights groups for hosting him. Barre was then given political asylum by Nigeria, then under military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida, and lived in Lagos until he died of a diabetes-related illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the sensitivity of the mission, the pilots asked the Nigerian diplomat to give them one more day to think about his request.

Michael Chakma was allegedly struck on the head with a metal bracelet, while Anjel Chakma suffered stab wounds. Michael has recovered but Anjel died 17 days later in hospital, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police in Uttarakhand state (whose capital is Dehradun) have arrested five people in connection with the incident, but they have denied that the attack was racially motivated - a claim that Chakma's family strongly disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which has triggered protests in several cities, has put the spotlight on allegations of racism faced by people from India's north-eastern states when they move to larger cities for education or work. They say they are often mocked over their appearance, questioned about nationality and harassed in public spaces and workplaces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the discrimination extends beyond abuse to everyday barriers that shape where and how they live. People from the region report difficulty renting accommodation, with landlords refusing tenants because of their appearance, food habits or stereotypes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such pressures have led many north-eastern migrants in large cities to cluster in specific neighbourhoods, offering safety, mutual support and cultural familiarity far from home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while many say they learn to endure everyday prejudices to build lives elsewhere in the country, violent crimes such as Anjel Chakma's killing are deeply unsettling.

No specific anti-racism legislation has been enacted, and many of the recommendations remain only partially implemented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has sought clarification from the federal government, but they are yet to respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The renewed demands over an anti-racism law have revived a broader debate over whether legislation can address prejudice, often seen as rooted in social behaviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts and activists such as Chakma and Golmei argue that it can. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They cite laws criminalising dowry and caste-based atrocities, arguing that while these haven't ended abuse, they have empowered victims and raised awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An anti-racism law could empower victims, improve reporting and place racial abuse clearly within the scope of criminal accountability,\" Golmei said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile in Tripura, Tarun Chakma mourns his elder son while facing uncertainty over his younger one: Michael, a final-year sociology student, is expected to return to Dehradun to complete his studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While family members have urged caution, Tarun Chakma says he is torn between fear for his son's safety and the belief that abandoning his education would amount to another loss. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the end of the day, higher education for a better future was the reason for which we had sent our sons so far away from home,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There are multiple videos taken by bystanders from various locations. And yet even the basic facts are being disputed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost immediately after the shooting, two starkly different accounts began to take shape. Any ambiguities in the videos shared online were seized upon - different angles and different screengrabs were used to push a particular narrative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And on the public stage, state and federal officials openly disagreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the driver – 37-year-old Renee Good – was to blame. As she drove away from ICE officers, she \"weaponised her car\" in a \"domestic terror attack\", Noem said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump blamed a \"professional agitator\" and a \"radical left movement of violence and hate\" in a Truth Social post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">National Democrats - and state and local officials in Minnesota - have painted a completely different picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jacob Frey, the Democratic Mayor of Minneapolis, said a federal agent \"recklessly\" used lethal force. He also issued an expletive-laced demand for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting \"totally predictable\" and \"totally avoidable\", arguing it was a direct consequence of the surge in federal immigration officers into Minneapolis and surrounding areas in recent days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous, sensationalised operations are a threat to our public safety,\" he said on Wednesday.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Image shows a protest against ICE in Minneapolis\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">There have been demonstrations against ICE operations following the shooting</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This clear division between the federal government and local officials was only further illustrated on Thursday morning, when the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that the justice department and the FBI were no longer co-operating with its investigation into the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal agencies, it said, would be solely responsible for handling the investigation into the use of lethal force by the ICE agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That Minnesota has become the epicentre of a growing conflict over immigration enforcement in recent months is both unsurprising - and ironic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is ironic because Good's death occurred just a few miles from where, in 2020, Minneapolis police killed George Floyd during an attempted arrest, setting off nationwide Black Lives Matters protests – including some, in Minneapolis, that turned violent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walz has put the state's National Guard on standby, and cautioned the hundreds of protesters who have taken to the streets not to resort to violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota's central role in this latest flare-up is unsurprising because it marks the culmination of conflict, controversy and scandal that had been building for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent surge in immigration enforcement comes after Trump derided the state's large Somali immigrant population -

The use of force during this operation is far from an isolated incident, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minnesota incident was at least the ninth immigration-enforcement-related shooting since September – all involving individuals who were targeted while in their vehicles - according to the New York Times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The intensity with which the immigration actions have been undertaken – in an expanding list of cities across the US – has led to protests and calls from Democratic officials for greater oversight, accountability and restraint among law enforcement agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fatal Minneapolis shooting has already given these efforts new urgency among their advocates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump administration officials, for their part, are pressing ahead – citing the mandate they say they received from voters in the 2024 presidential election as well as the evidence, in dramatically reduced undocumented entries into the US, that their efforts have proven effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also vigorously disputed the argument that the video of the Minneapolis shooting is evidence of a misuse of lethal force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it,\" Vice-President JD Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While he said the incident was tragic, he added that \"it falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walz, in his next public comments, was quick to counter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People in positions of power have already passed judgement, from the president to the vice-president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,\" he said. \"They have determined the character of a 37-year-old mom that they didn't even know.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears that even video evidence is open to interpretation at this point. Each person sees the same images and draws decidedly different conclusions – ones that frequently, perhaps not surprisingly, reinforce their previously established positions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chasm in US politics seems as immutable as it is daunting.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

It was amazing, amazing work by these people. No one else could do something like this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president wants and needs quick victories. Before he took office for the second time, he boasted that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be a single day's work.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela, as presented in Trump's statements, is the quick, decisive victory that he has craved. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro is in a prison cell in Brooklyn, the US will \"run\" Venezuela - and he has announced that the Chavista regime, now with a new president, will turn over millions of barrels of oil and that he will control the way the profits are spent. All, so far anyway, without an American life lost and without the long occupation that had such catastrophic consequences after the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, at least, Trump and his advisers, publicly at least, are ignoring Venezuela's complexities. It is a country bigger than Germany, still run by the regime of factions that has embedded corruption and repression into Venezuelan politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Trump is enjoying a geopolitical sugar rush. Judging by their statements as they flanked him at Mar-a-Lago, so are US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, they have repeated that Trump was a president who does what he says he is going to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's made it clear to Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Greenland – and Denmark – that they need to be nervous about where his appetite will take him next.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump likes nicknames. He still calls his predecessor Sleepy Joe Biden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now he's trying out a new name for the Monroe Doctrine, which has been a foundation of US policy in Latin America for two centuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump renamed it, naturally, after himself – the Donroe doctrine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, unveiled the original in December 1823. It declared that the western hemisphere was America's sphere of interest – and warned European powers not to meddle or establish new colonies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Donroe Doctrine puts Monroe's 200-year-old message on steroids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago as Maduro, blindfolded and shackled, was on this way to jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Three law enforcement officers escorting handcuffed Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on tarmac in New York City.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are now being detained in New York</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any rival or potential threat, especially China, has to stay out of Latin America. It's not clear where that leaves the massive investments that China has already made in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donroe also extends the huge area the US calls its \"backyard\" north to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2026 equivalent of Monroe's copperplate handwriting is a photo of a frowning, moody looking Trump posted by the US State Department on social media. The words with it say, \"this is OUR hemisphere – and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That means using US military and economic power to coerce countries and leaders that get out of line – and to take their resources if necessary. As Trump warned another possible target, the president of Colombia – they need to watch their ass.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is in America's sights, not just because of its strategic importance in the Arctic – but because it has rich mineral resources that are becoming accessible as climate change melts the ice sheets. Rare earths from Greenland and heavy crude oil from Venezuela are both seen as strategic US assets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike other interventionist US presidents, Trump does not cloak his actions with the legitimacy, however spurious, of international law or the pursuit of democracy. The only legitimacy he needs comes from his belief in the force of his own will, backed by raw US power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From Monroe to Donroe, foreign policy doctrines matter to US presidents. They shape their actions and their legacies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, the US will celebrate its 250th birthday. In 1796, its first president, George Washington, announced he wouldn't seek a third term with a farewell address that still resonates today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington issued a series of warnings about the US and the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Temporary alliances in time of war might be necessary, but the US should otherwise avoid permanent alliances with foreign nations. That started the tradition of isolationism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home, he warned citizens to beware of extreme partisanship. Division, he said, was a danger to the young American republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senate does an annual public re-reading of Washington's farewell address, a ritual that does not cut through the hyper-partisan and polarised politics of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington's warning about the dangers of entangling alliances was followed for 150 years. After World War One, the US left Europe and returned to isolationism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But World War Two made the US into a global power. And that is where another doctrine comes in, much more significant for the way Europeans have lived – until Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 1947, the Cold War with the Soviet Union had turned frigid. The UK, left bankrupt by the war, told the US it could no longer fund the Greek government's fight with communists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then-President Harry Truman's response was to commit US to support, in his words, \"free peoples resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\". He meant threats from the Soviet Union or homegrown communists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was the Truman Doctrine. It led to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe, followed in 1949 by the creation of Nato. Atlanticists in the US, like Harry Truman and George Kennan - the diplomat who came up with the idea of containing the Soviet Union - believed those commitments were in America's interests.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a direct line from the Truman Doctrine to Joe Biden's decision to fund Ukraine's war effort. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, the Truman Doctrine created the relationship with Europe that Trump has been dismantling. It was a sharp break with the past. Truman ignored Washington's warning about permanent entangling alliances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now Trump is breaking with Truman's legacy. If he follows through with his threat to somehow take possession of Greenland, which is Danish sovereign territory, he could destroy what's left of the transatlantic alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maga ideologue and powerful Trump adviser Stephen Miller summed it up earlier this week on CNN. The US, he said, was operating in the real world that \"is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power… these are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US president would deny the need for strength and power. But from Franklin D Roosevelt, through Truman and all their successors until Trump, the men in the Oval Office believed the best way to be powerful was to lead an alliance, which meant give and take.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They supported the new United Nations and the drive to make rules to regulate the behaviour of states. The US, of course, has ignored and violated international law many times – doing much to hollow out the idea of a rules-based international order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump's predecessors did not try to sweep away the notion that the international system needed regulation, however flawed and incomplete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because of the catastrophic consequences in the first half of the 20th Century of the rule of the strongest – two world wars and millions dead.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the combination of Trump's \"America First\" ideology and his businessman's acquisitive, transactional instincts have led him to believe that America's allies need to pay for the privilege of his favour. Friendship seems too strong a word. America's interests, in the narrow definition laid out by the president, require it to stay top dog by acting alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump changes his mind often. But one constant appears to be his belief that the US can use its power with impunity. He says that it is the way to make America great again. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The risk is that, if Trump sticks to his course, he will push the world back to the way it was in the age of empires a century or more ago - a world where big powers, with spheres of influence, sought to impose their will, and where mighty authoritarian nationalists led their peoples to disaster.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The henchmen are still there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's risky as hell.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"I want a president who's involved\" - Michiganders weigh in on Maduro's seizure</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his dramatic news conference on Saturday morning, US President Donald Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as \"not respected\" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as \"gracious.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,\" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Her movement was massively elected... and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice-president might have been in on the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,\" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,\" Gunson says. \"There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,\" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the challenges, he says, have only just begun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: The key questions on Trump’s actions on Venezuela</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think she can deliver on that,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan would lead to what Rubio called \"a process of reconciliation\", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,\" he said, without elaborating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming \"permanently unavailable to serve\" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. \"We have to fix the country first,\" he said. \"You can't have an election.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,\" he says. \"Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's \"dedazo\", a Spanish slang term meaning a \"finger pointing\", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is Trump's dedazo,\" he says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Any small advantage, from the shape of new components to the companies in global supply chains, is a source of potential leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a notable Californian vibe in this temple of high science, in its art and colour.

He said it settled \"once and for all\" the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years, so more than a trillion trillion, or one with 25 zeros on the end, more than the age of the universe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven reels off the ways he believes this Willow quantum chip will be used \"to help with many problems that humankind has now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently,\" he says. \"It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport energy, to store energy... solve climate change and human hunger.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us,\" he tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some researchers believe that actual Artificial Intelligence will only be truly possible with quantum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the team here have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into \"superconducting qubits\" used here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Willow chip has 105 qubits. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04gvx7egw5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Microsoft's quantum effort has 8 qubits</a>, but uses a different approach. The race around the world is to get to 1 million qubits for a \"utility scale machine\" that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error. The technology is fragile.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Companies around the world are racing to make a revolutionary new generation of computers.</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What is going on here is being watched carefully around the world. Professor Sir Peter Knight, Chair of the National Quantum Technology Programmes Strategy Advisory Board, says Willow broke new ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This puts the technology on a path to being scaled towards accurately doing a trillion operations, perhaps within seven or eight years, rather than the two decades previously assumed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the first quarter of this century was defined by the rise of the internet and then Artificial Intelligence, the next 25 years will surely be the start of the quantum era.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How does it work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed drawers. A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time. Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops. But the point is that the power of these computers grows exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked Nvidia chief Jensen Huang whether this poses a threat to his model of providing the specialised chips for AI. \"No, a quantum processor will be added to a computer in the future,\" he replied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And one of the UK's leaders in the field points out what is up for grabs in the quantum world - the eventual power to decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat,\" Sir Peter says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A top partner to Nvidia last year said that while Bitcoin had a few years yet, the technology needed to fork to a stronger blockchain by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tech industry sources refer to the process of \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" to describe how state agencies are believed to be saving all of the world's encrypted data at home and abroad with the expectation of future generations being able to access it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Global race</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And then there is the race across the world. China's approach is very different to the commercial race in the US and the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At around $15bn (£11bn), the total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of all the rest of the world's government programmes put together, says Sir Peter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2022 China has published more scientific papers on quantum than other countries, the efforts have been led by a pioneering physicist called Pan Jianwei. It is a key part of Beijing's 14th five-year plan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China took a decision to stop its tech companies such as Baidu and Alibaba from developing their own quantum research – and concentrate the people and the infrastructure into a state-run enterprise. China is trying to get the edge on quantum communications and satellites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Pan developed and tested the Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum computer using similar technology though a different approach to that of Willow, claiming similar results. In the autumn it was opened up for commercial use. It all feels a little like the World War Two Manhattan Project to produce the first nuclear weapons, or the Space Race of the 21st Century.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK is one of the scientific heartlands for quantum research. It was a British scientist who did the original research on superconducting qubits. There are dozens of companies and cutting-edge research here. The government plans to make a significant investment around this in the coming weeks. It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Parallel universes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is still a spirited debate,\" he tells me. \"As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch two to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was \"suggestive that we should take this idea seriously\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpLvGmPetds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"address to the nation\".</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the world still unwrapping the tariffs \"gift\" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although \"the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced\", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2025/october/english/execsum.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to slow to 3.1% in 2026.</a> A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbim.no/en/news-and-insights/podcast/2025/kristalina-georgieva-leading-the-imf-navigating-global-crises-and-strengthening-cooperation/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"better than we feared, worse than it needs to be\".</a> Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other forecasts for 2026 are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piie.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/piie-sees-global-economic-growth-slowing-2026-amid-policy-headwinds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">even more pessimistic</a> than that of the IMF.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because \"countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Obstfeld adds: \"And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trumps-trade-war-with-china-2025-2025-10-13/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">more tariffs and other trade restrictions</a> in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the resilience seen so far, \"these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time\", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unctad.org/news/global-trade-hit-record-35-trillion-despite-slowing-momentum\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">more than $35tn (£26tn).</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. \"The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Countries including the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly4jz9zr50o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">South Korea</a> and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump.
