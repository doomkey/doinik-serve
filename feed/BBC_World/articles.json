Dozens remain missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Wang Fuk Court blocks had been undergoing renovations when the fire began. The cause remains unclear - but officials say that polystyrene and protective netting placed on the outside of the windows facilitated its spread.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eight people were arrested on Friday on suspicion of corruption over the renovation works the towers had been undergoing. Three other people were detained earlier on manslaughter charges.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An investigation is ongoing, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said - adding that those arrested on Friday including directors at an engineering company and scaffolding subcontractors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some 2,311 firefighters worked to bring the fire under control after it spread across seven of Wang Fuk Court's eight apartment blocks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firefighting efforts have now ceased. The fire was fully extinguished by 10:18 local time (02:18 GMT) on Friday, the fire department said at a news conference.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also said 89 bodies have yet to be identified, and 16 bodies remain inside the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities said police would now go into the buildings to start gathering evidence, and that an investigation would take place over the next three to four weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, crowds have been gathering at a nearby community hall that has been opened to families looking for missing loved ones. Relatives are being asked to help with the identification process by bringing in family photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hong Kong government has also set up shelters and support centres for displaced residents. Groups of volunteers have been packing and organising supplies for those affected, including clothing and hygiene products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The blaze started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, and by 18:22 local time it had been upgraded to the most serious category by fire officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire department said the fire started at a lower level before moving upwards, and reached a peak temperature of 500C (932F).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result, the blaze reignited in some places after being doused, they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One former resident, who moved out earlier this year and only gave his surname, told the BBC: \"There was nothing we could do. Together we watched our homes burn gradually.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire spread quickly across the separate blocks due to the presence of flammable netting and other materials on the outside of the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, has been identified as among those killed. He was found collapsed at the scene on Wednesday, about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twelve other firefighters have also been injured, authorities said.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two Indonesian nationals who had been working on the buildings were also killed in the fire, a migrant charity said. Indonesian and Filipino workers are among those still unaccounted for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indonesian worker Fita had been inside the building with her employer when she heard the fire brigade siren. She described it as scary and confusing, but added that she felt \"so grateful\" to be safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But I'm concerned about friends I know... Usually we talk, and then I haven't met them [since the fire],\" she told news agency Reuters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of those in the shelters have been unwilling to speak to the media while reeling from the trauma.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shock has quickly shifted to anger in Hong Kong, as questions grow on who should be held accountable for the blaze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that fire alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, one resident told the BBC that some of the alarms had been turned off by construction workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports of residents' prior complaints over high renovation fees and whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations have also resurfaced and are circulating widely online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"group-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><section class=\"sc-2d9149e5-0 cSvbpL\"><div data-testid=\"slideshowWrapper\" class=\"sc-bb9c31df-0 eyDYxi\"><hr class=\"sc-bb9c31df-13 TJGYy\"><div class=\"sc-bb9c31df-9 sc-bb9c31df-12 kJXtbZ dLZLyt\"><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-11 CMaeP loiCSF djVHpK\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">As firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessed</figcaption></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Thick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched on</figcaption></p></div></div></section></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wang Fuk Court was built in 1983 and had provided 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-martin-yip-and-gemini-cheng-in-hong-kong\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Martin Yip and Gemini Cheng in Hong Kong</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Such a plan could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's announcements after Wednesday's fatal attack represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among other moves, Trump has sought to enact mass deportations of migrants who entered the US illegally, to drastically cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights that currently apply to nearly anyone born on US territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Wednesday's shooting, Trump promised to remove from the US any foreigner \"from any country who does not belong here\". The same day, the US suspended processing all immigration requests from Afghans, saying the decision was made pending a review of \"security and vetting protocols\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Thursday, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries. The agency did not explicitly mention Wednesday's attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by the BBC which countries were on the list, the USCIS pointed to a June proclamation by the White House that included Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela. There were no further details about what the re-examination would look like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's strongly worded two-part post on Thursday night went further still, pledging to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president wrote in a Truth Social post that this would \"allow the US system to fully recover\" from policies that had eroded the \"gains and living conditions\" of many Americans. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump announces death of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Third-world countries'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the post, the president also blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post, which Trump introduced as a \"Happy Thanksgiving salutation\", was filled with anti-immigrant language. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that \"hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota\" and took particular aim at the state's Democratic lawmakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover,\" the president wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The phrase \"third world\" is a term that was used in the past to describe poorer, developing nations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House and USCIS have not yet given further details of Trump's plan, which Trump did not directly link in his post to Wednesday's attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president had already imposed a travel ban on nationals of Afghanistan - and 11 other countries, primarily in Africa and Asia - earlier this year. Another travel ban targeting a number of majority-Muslim countries was enacted during his first term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN responded to Trump's words by urging his administration to observe international agreements regarding asylum seekers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,\" the deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general told Reuters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump response amounted to a \"scapegoating\" of migrants in the US, argued Jeremy McKinney, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newsday programme before Trump's latest comments, Mr McKinney highlighted that the attacker's motive was not known. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These types of issues - they don't know skin colour, they don't know nationality,\" he said. \"When a person becomes radicalised or is suffering some type of mental illness, that person can come from any background.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Suspect in DC shooting is Afghan</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flurry of announcements come after officials said that the suspect in the Washington DC shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had come to the US in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He travelled under a programme that offered special immigration protections to Afghans who had worked with US forces in the wake of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Information is continuing to emerge about the extent of Mr Lakanwal's work alongside the Americans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lakanwal previously worked alongside the CIA, the agency's current director has said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He helped guard US forces at Kabul airport as thousands scrambled to escape Afghanistan before the Taliban took power, a former military commander who served alongside him told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of five had been recruited to Unit 03 of the Kandahar Strike Force, nine years earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His unit was known locally as Scorpion Forces, operating initially under the CIA but eventually for the Afghan intelligence department known as the National Directorate of Security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lakanwal was a GPS tracker specialist, the former commander told the BBC, describing him as a \"sporty and jolly character\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lakanwal would have been vetted by the US both at the time the he started his work alongside the CIA, and when he ultimately travelled to the US, according to a senior US official who spoke to CNN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A childhood friend told the New York Times that Mr Lakanwal had experienced mental health issues after his work with his unit.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lakanwal later applied for asylum in 2024. His application was granted earlier this year, reportedly after Trump returned to power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mr Lakanwal's request for a green card, which is tied to the asylum grant, is pending, a Homeland Security official told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspect was arrested after the attack and was said to be not co-operating with authorities. Trump described the incident as an \"act of terror\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the following day that one of the two members of the National Guard who were shot had died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old from West Virginia, was working in the city as part of Trump's deployment of National Guard members to crack down on crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She had volunteered to work in DC over the US Thanksgiving holiday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second National Guard member, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was said by Trump to be \"fighting for his life\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">FBI: Suspect had relationship with 'partner forces' in Afghanistan</figcaption></p><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

He is also Kyiv's lead negotiator in peace talks with the US, but his position has come increasingly under threat from critics calling for him to go.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak, 54, confirmed on social media that both Nabu and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office (Sap) were \"conducting procedural actions at my home\" and had full access to his apartment, with his lawyers on site.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"From my side, there is full co-operation,\" said the chief of staff, who has not been named as a suspect.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The searches come at a very awkward moment for Zelensky and his closest ally, with US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll due to arrive in Kyiv by the end of this week as US President Donald Trump pushes ahead with a draft peace plan. US officials are heading to Moscow next week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the main sticking points for Ukraine is Russia's demand for Ukraine to hand over the territory it still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. \"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" Vladimir Putin said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak, who wields enormous influence at the top of government in Kyiv, underlined his leading role in the negotiations when he told The Atlantic website hours before news of the searches emerged that \"as long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory. He will not sign away territory\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Putin has been emboldened by minor territorial gains by Russian forces, claiming their offensive \"is practically impossible to hold back\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Zelensky's own position has been weakened by the domestic corruption scandal, and Russia's president has long questioned his legitimacy as leader. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine this month, with investigators linking  several leading public figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two anti-corruption agencies, Nabu and Sap, said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Domestically, the corruption inquiry probe is being welcomed, but internationally it leaves Ukraine's negotiating position in a potentially perilous state.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian officials involved in the draft peace plan have talked up the corruption claims, which have alarmed European Union allies. Ukraine is a candidate to join the EU and a report earlier this month highlighted doubts over \"commitment to its anti-corruption agenda\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among Ukrainians, Andriy Yermak's own popularity has nose-dived. MPs from all parties, including his own, have been calling for his sacking, initially for what they saw as his inflated power for an unelected official, but more recently, the burgeoning corruption scandal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent polling suggests 70% of the public want him to resign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of suspects have already been charged over the scandal that has outraged public opinion because of allegations that money was diverted from key infrastructure projects vital for safeguarding Ukrainian power supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian attacks have badly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Ukrainians across the country have had to cope with only a few hours of electricity a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his interview late on Thursday, Yermak acknowledged that pressure on him to stand down was \"enormous... The case is fairly loud, and there needs to be an objective and independent investigation without political influence\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has already fired two ministers and several suspects have been detained in the scandal. One of the president's former business associates, Timur Mindich, has fled the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was co-owner of the TV studio Kvartal 95 where Zelensky's acting career took off before he was elected president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite not being implicated and denying any involvement, Yermak has struggled to distance himself from the scandal.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, his critics have previously accused him of fabricating crises in order to crack down on dissent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ecowas leaders have suspended Guinea-Bissau from all decision-making organs until constitutional order is restored. In a statement, the bloc ordered the military to return to the barracks, calling its actions a \"grave violation of Guinea-Bissau's constitutional order\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The African Union (AU) has also condemned the coup and called for respect for the constitutional order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the situation in Guinea Bissau, calling for an \"immediate and unconditional restoration of constitutional order\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guinea-Bissau has witnessed at least nine coups or attempted coups over the last five decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-wycliffe-muia,-nicolas-negoce-and-natasha-booty\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Wycliffe Muia, Nicolas Negoce and Natasha Booty </i></p></div></div></body></html>"

primarily of North African descent - at a Montreal elementary school were suspended after a government report said they had created a toxic environment for students and staff, and largely avoided certain subjects like science and sex education.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the teachers had tried to introduce \"Islamist\" beliefs and vowed to strengthen secularism measures in schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/politiques-orientations/laicite-etat/comite-etude-respect-laicite\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a government-mandated committee</a> released a report with recommendations including a ban on religious symbols for daycare workers and the phasing out of public funding for private religious schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And last month, the Legault government passed a law extending secularism rules to staff who interact with students in public primary and high schools, and barring students from wearing face coverings. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images A man is black athletic clothes runs by a blue sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French 'I choose secularism'\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French \"I choose secularism\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Quebec's secularism law?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bill 21 prohibits public officials in positions of authority - such as judges, police officers, teachers and public servants  - from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also requires public services to be provided and received with the face uncovered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Bill 21, the Quebec government invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" - a part of the Canadian constitution that allows government to override \"fundamental freedoms\" of religion, expression, and association, as well as the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and freedom from discrimination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It essentially serves an opt-out that prevents courts from striking down the legislation on constitutional grounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bill 21 does not mention any specific religion and would include symbols worn by a person of any faith, including Christians, and affirms the religious neutrality of the province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics argue it targets mostly religious minorities, especially women of Muslim faith. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law has faced a number of legal challenges in Quebec. Canada's Supreme Court has now agreed to take up the case, which will hinge both on the law itself and the use of the notwithstanding clause. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate over secularism - broadly, the principle that religion and government institutions should be separate - has played a significant role in the province's public discourse for almost two decades. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Known in the majority French-speaking province as laïcité, it has been an important value in Quebec society since the 1960s as the Catholic Church's strong influence began to wane in the province.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A September survey by polling firm Leger, commissioned by media outlets Le Journal de Montréal and TVA, indicated that 68% of respondents thought secularism was an important value. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar legislation to Bill 21 is in place in various countries across the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004 and on face covering in public spaces in 2010. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says.

European representatives were also in the Swiss city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian <i id=\"de-facto\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">de facto </i>control<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i>but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208wjpv4r9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset</a> and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They said he is, pale, underweight and is suffering from conditions contracted in captivity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Mohammed's uncle spoke of the family's \"immense relief\". Zeyad Kadur said the family had been \"living a horrific and endless nightmare\" over the last nine months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Right now, we are focused on getting Mohammed the immediate medical attention he needs after being subjected to Israel's abuse and inhumane conditions for months. We just want Mohammed to be healthy and to have his childhood back,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Israeli soldiers had no right to take Mohammed from us in the first place,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state department said it would continue to provide consular support to Mohammed's family. \"The Trump Administration has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week Mohammed's father Zahar Ibrahim told the BBC he was frustrated that the US government was not <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c30jp1m43p5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">doing more to get his son out of jail</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twenty-seven US lawmakers had signed a letter to the state department and President Donald Trump, demanding more be done to release him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Ibrahim, a father-of-four who runs an ice cream business in Florida, previously said his son only confessed to throwing stones because the soldiers beat him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had not seen or spoken to Mohammed since February, and only heard what had happened to him in detention through court documents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mohammed was held without charge in Ofer prison on the West Bank. It is also home to adult prisoners, some of whom have been convicted of serious terrorism offences and murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are around 350 Palestinian child security detainees being held in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli Prison Service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many have never been charged and human rights groups, as well as the United Nations, say some have suffered abuse and torture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following Mohammed's release, Mr Kadur said the family would also continue fighting for justice for his cousin Sayfollah Musallet, a 20-year-old dual US citizen who the Palestinian health ministry said was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2mknzn99eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">beaten to death by Israeli settlers</a> during a confrontation in July. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time the Israeli military said authorities were looking into reports a Palestinian civilian had been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mohammed and Sayfollah had worked together in the family ice cream shop in Tampa, Florida. No one has been charged with Sayfollah's killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We expect the American government to protect our families,\" Mr Kadur said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This part of the country is the heartland of the Shia Muslim community, and for decades has been under the sway of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political party. On streets, banners with the faces of fighters killed in battle hang from lamp-posts, celebrating them as \"martyrs of the resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I arrived in Froun an hour after the strike. Rescue workers had already removed the body parts of the only casualty - a man who was later described as a \"Hezbollah terrorist\" by the Israeli military. Despite a ceasefire deal that came into force last November, ending the latest war with Hezbollah, Israel has continued with its bombing, almost every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Who is going to help us?\" one resident, Mohamad Mokdad, asked me. The car had been hit as it passed in front of his house, and he was still cleaning up the veranda. \"There were body parts here and in the trees.\" He sounded despondent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're against all this... I just want to live in peace. I don't want parties,\" he said. He did not mention Hezbollah - which means \"Party of God\" - by name, but that is probably what he meant. \"I don't want anyone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah and the group's efforts to recover after being severely weakened in the war. I travelled to southern Lebanon to see the impact of the Israeli campaign, and saw that the attacks had shattered people's sense of security and even some long-held views in areas where Hezbollah has traditionally enjoyed widespread support.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man and woman sit on a tiled area outside a house, after dark.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Israeli attack in Froun happened outside Mohamad Mokdad's house</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ceasefire in Lebanon ended 13 months of war that killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis. Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting for decades, and this conflict started when Hezbollah began firing rockets and missiles at Israeli positions a day after Israel launched its massive military response to the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The truce, brokered by the US and France, required Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, and Israeli troops to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon that they invaded during the war. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers would then be sent to areas that had been effectively under Hezbollah control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, the Israeli military continues to occupy at least five hilltops in southern Lebanon and has carried out air and drone attacks across the country on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn81j54xjx1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Last Sunday, it killed the group's chief of staff and four others</a> in a strike on a building in the Dahieh district, outside Beirut.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon that operates south of the Litani, says Israel has committed more than 10,000 air and ground violations during the ceasefire. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Israeli attacks, including civilians.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been working to rebuild its military capabilities south of the Litani, which would be a violation of the ceasefire, and also tried to smuggle weapons into Lebanon while ramping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, Israel has not made the evidence it says it has public. But, for weeks, Israeli journalists have been briefed on plans for a possible escalation against the group. \"Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,\" Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said recently.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC Destroyed buildings and piles of rubble are seen on a hillside in southern Lebanon.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lebanese communities along the border with Israel are still in ruins, and thousands of residents remain displaced</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joseph Aoun, the Lebanese president, came to power in January promising a \"state monopoly on arms\" - in other words, to disarm Hezbollah. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, Hezbollah is more than a militia. Despite the recent blows, it remains a powerful political party with representation in the government and parliament, and a significant social movement, providing services in areas where the state is absent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Unifil spokesperson told me they had not observed any military activity by Hezbollah or attempts to rebuild infrastructure. Hezbollah, too, rejects the Israeli allegations and says the terms of the ceasefire deal only apply to south of the Litani. There, it has not opposed the Lebanese army's operations against its arsenal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has not fired on Israel since the truce came into force, although it did launch several mortars that hit an Israeli army base in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights in December, in response to what it said were repeated Israeli violations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC Hands hold a mobile phone, on which can be seen a satellite image with red and blue dots marking locations.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The map, issued by a spokesperson for the Israeli military, showing locations that were allegedly being used by Hezbollah in the village of Beit Lif</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli army, published on social media a warning for the Lebanese village of Beit Lif: Israel had detected \"dozens of terrorist infrastructures\" belonging to Hezbollah, and would act to remove any threat. Worried that an attack could be imminent, residents made a public appeal, late at night, for Lebanese soldiers to be deployed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I visited Beit Lif the following morning. (To travel to southern Lebanon, we had to inform Hezbollah's media office in Beirut; the group did not interfere in our reporting.) The village had a pre-war population of around 8,000; now, less than a third remains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local imam, a 63-year-old man who did not want to have his name published, told me the Lebanese soldiers had arrived with Unifil troops, patrolled the streets and left after about five hours, before dawn. The Lebanese military has refused to inspect private properties, possibly in order not to be seen to be collaborating with Israel; in Beit Lif too, the imam said, they did not enter any houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we spoke, half a dozen men gathered around us on the grounds of a mosque that had been destroyed in an Israeli air strike during the war. Quietly, one of them told me: \"Hezbollah needs to decide: it either responds to Israel or accepts defeat, disarms and let us move on with our lives. This can't continue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public criticism of Hezbollah is still rare but, exhausted, some appear to be questioning the old consensus. We then heard a distant sound – from Israeli fighter jets in the sky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the locations that appeared to have been highlighted in Col Adraee's  message was a house in front of the municipality building. Israel has frequently accused Hezbollah of embedding its arsenal in civilian areas, an allegation I had also heard from some residents during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ezzat Hammoud, the Beit Lif mayor, told me: \"No, no, no. There are no militants or weapons here. I can be held responsible for what I'm saying.\" So why, if that was the case, had his village attracted the attention of the Israeli military? \"Either to terrify the residents and force them to move,\" he said, \"or to put pressure on the Lebanese army to confront people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man is seen on a road, with a woman nearby, in front of a building which has a large image on the side.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Haider said his house had been marked by the Israeli military as a building being used by Hezbollah, which he denied</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A man called Haider, whose family owned the house, insisted on taking me to visit it.

He said the group would \"never\" surrender its weapons, which he called the \"source of its strength\". \"The enemy,\" Qassem said, referring to Israel and the United States, \"wants to erase our life and our existence, but we'll remain steadfast. We'll either live with dignity or die with dignity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hezbollah's arsenal, more powerful than that of the country's own army, has long divided the Lebanese. Opponents accuse Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into wars and of defending the interests of the group's main backer, Iran. They see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it. But President Aoun, who is a former army chief, has refused to use force against Hezbollah, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to a civil war. If the authorities were not careful, Aoun said in April, \"we'll lead Lebanon to ruin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Western diplomat familiar with the discussions told me the Lebanese authorities were under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, which was frustrated with the pace of the efforts and supported Israel's actions in Lebanon. \"Some are seeing this as the 'Lebanese way' of doing things,\" the diplomat said about the disarmament plans, and \"aren't convinced\" it can work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army is expected to announce it has completed the disarmament of the group in the areas south of the Litani next month. The army, an intelligence officer told me, would then turn its attention to other parts of the country - Hezbollah's presence is also significant in the Dahieh and the eastern Bekaa Valley. This will be a more challenging, and risky, mission without the group's consent, and there is no timeline for that.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man with a weathered face and grey hair looks into the camera.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nayef al-Rida is one of the few remaining residents in the border village of Yaroun, which was devastated during the war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I drove on to the border village of Yaroun.

The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Volunteers give out food and drinks after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Hundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to some</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Residents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year.

We then sent a WhatsApp message to the number, which had an image of Zuma-Sambudla in the profile picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former MP filed an affidavit with police after her half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, accused her of tricking South Africans to join the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, confirmed that both women had registered cases with the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hawks did not give any details, but said in a statement that \"both matters are being investigated jointly to determine whether any criminality, including possible human trafficking, illegal recruitment, exploitation or fraud\" had taken place.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has seen a copy of Zuma-Sambudla's affidavit, which is unsigned but was widely reported in local media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was not a recruiter, agent, operator or facilitator of any unlawful activity,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has also seen a statement Zuma-Mncube gave police, alleging that her half-sister - along with two men, whom she named - lured 17 South Africans to Russia \"under false pretences\" and were \"handed to a Russian mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Among these 17 men, who are requesting the South African government for assistance, are eight of my family members,\" Zuma-Mncube says in the statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her affidavit, Zuma-Sambudla reveals that she herself had received non-combat training in Russia, and it was arranged by a man whom, she says, she did not know until he contacted her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he suggested recruiting more people to take part in what she believed would be a similar programme, she \"shared [this] information innocently\" with others, including family members, she says in the affidavit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would not, under any circumstances, knowingly expose my own family or any other person to harm,\" the MP adds in the affidavit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The discovery that people had been tricked into joining the war had \"caused me profound shock and distress\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am myself a victim of deception, misrepresentation, and manipulation,\" Zuma-Sambudla adds in the affidavit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, the South African government confirmed it had received distress calls from 17 of its citizens trapped in Donbas after being lured to join mercenary forces on the promise of lucrative contracts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the voice notes the BBC heard says that 24 South Africans had originally been duped into going to Ukraine, but three of them were taken back to Russia as they were deemed to be medically unfit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another voice note says one of the South Africans who was forced to stay in Ukraine was wounded, possibly by shrapnel and his whereabouts are unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A report by financial news agency Bloomberg said some men had also been recruited from neighbouring Botswana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's government has remained tight-lipped on the situation since its statement earlier this month. It had promised to work through \"diplomatic channels\" to bring them back home, but this has not yet happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With his brother still trapped in a war zone, Xolani speaks of his family's anguish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can go five days without hearing from him because he's off doing military stuff. The family is concerned about his life,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime in voice-note exchanges with his family, Sipho keeps repeating the appeal: \"It's tough here... we all [just] want to come home.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">You may also be interested in:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

There was no alarm warning them of danger, all of them told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Chung, 45, and his brother, spent Wednesday night on the street asking the firefighters dozens of times for updates - but they couldn't give them any.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout, he said, he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She probably did faint,\" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. \"I dare not call her again.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fee/live/ba9142a0-cb8b-11f0-a837-edb10d8a13be.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images An elderly woman, in a light purple top, cries and holds onto a young man in front of scafolded buildings.

His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet.

It's nearly 30 hours and there has been no updates from the fire service…\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a later post, she said: \"I am afraid there is no hope.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The devastation has spotlighted the expensive and controversial renovations at Wang Fuk Court, which cost about HK$330M ($42.2M; £32.1M), with each household having to pay between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many residents had opposed the project because of the costs but it went ahead. Authorities have now arrested three executives from the construction firm, citing \"gross negligence\".  Police say the mesh and plastic sheets used on the scaffolding were substandard, and that windows were wrapped in highly flammable styrofoam.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grandma Chan, a long-time resident, says she had been scared since the renovation began last year, because of its scale and she had occasionally noticed a burning smell. \"Will anything happen if I stay home?\" she once asked her daughter.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/618f/live/09c383b0-cb91-11f0-8b24-8191145688b1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Firefighters walk past charred bamboo scaffolding at Wang Fuk Court after a fire \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The fire was only brought under control after almost 24 hours</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 72-year-old was alone at home when the fire started but she only found out about it when her daughter, who was travelling in South Korea, called. She says she made it out alive because her daughter told her to flee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the same for 82-year-old Grandma Wu. When the fire broke out, she was playing mahjong, a popular game, with her neighbours. They were warned not by an alarm, but by their husbands calling them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she said they continued the game because there were three buildings between theirs and Wang Cheong House, where the fire broke out. Then came a second call, saying the fire had reached their building. The women immediately took the lift and reached the ground floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Surrounded by the smell of burning buildings, Grandma Wu looked up to find that seven of eight buildings within the complex were in flames.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although she was safe, she stayed outside, with her helper, overnight. She says her son wanted to take her to his home but she refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have been living in this flat for 42 years,\" she says. \"I told my son not to come, and I would not go anywhere.

But the vast country - bigger than France and Germany combined - also faces many other security challenges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent attempts by US President Donald Trump and his supporters to frame the insecurity purely as the persecution of Christians overlooks the complexity of Africa's most-populous nation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are criminal gangs in the north-west, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, clashes over land in central regions and separatist unrest in the south-east - leaving the 400,000-strong army and the police force of 370,000 officers overstretched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's a breakdown of the main armed groups and flashpoints:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Bandits'  - kidnap gangs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", are largely composed of people  from the Fulani ethnic group, who traditionally make their living by raising animals. They have traded their pastoral tools for assault rifles, which have flooded Nigeria - and other states in the region - since Libya descended into anarchy following the overthrow in 2011 of long-time strongman Muammar Gadaffi by Nato-backed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs are not known to be motivated by any religious or political ideology, but see kidnapping people for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money rather than walking for miles with their livestock in search of water and grazing land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They typically move in large numbers on motorcycles, which makes them highly mobile and allows them to strike quickly and escape before the security forces can respond - a tactic used during two recent school abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no centrally organised leadership - each gang, often drawn from one family or a specific community, tends to be loyal to its own leader. The police have placed bounties on some of the notable leaders, including Ado Aleru and Bello Turji, and in 2022 the government designated the bandits as \"terrorists\" in a bid to stem their violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aleru is from Yankuzo town - an area in the north-western state of Zamfara which has been a hub for bandit activity over the last three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs, which sometimes fight one another, also travel to neighbouring states and central regions to carry out kidnappings. They also prey on their local communities and are indiscriminate in their ransom demands. In some areas, they tax residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Younger bandits, some in their teens, are increasingly taking to TikTok to show off their ransom money, guns and motorcycles - and have garnered thousands of followers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Boko Haram - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Islamist militant group became infamous around the world in 2014 for kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok - around 90 of whom remain missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It evolved from a local Islamist sect founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri with the official name of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad and a political goal of creating an Islamic state. Local residents dubbed it Boko Haram - a name which in the Hausa language loosely translates as \"Western education is forbidden\" because of their opposition to Western-style schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its full-blown insurgency was triggered in 2009 by the killing of Yusuf who had been taken into police custody after Boko Haram clashed with the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At one point under its new leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram controlled large swathes of territory in Nigeria's north-east - and appointed \"emirs\" to administer some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chibok girls were only a small fraction of the many thousands of women and children taken into captivity and forced into sexual slavery, domestic servitude or used as suicide bombers by the militants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram then split into rival factions. After the death of Shekau four years ago, its strength has diminished, however it still conducts regular attacks on both civilians and security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram has spawned a range of groups that use kidnapping to raise funds, focusing on soft targets such as schools, churches, mosques and remote villages where paved roads and bridges are either inadequate or absent.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iswap - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Boko Haram commanders - including Abu Musab al-Barnawi, believed to be the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf - formed what became known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) in around 2016 as they felt Abubakar Shekau was violating Islamic doctrine by killing Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram routinely targeted markets and mosques, often with suicide bombers. Iswap generally avoids attacking Muslim civilians and focuses on military and government targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/west-africa/nigeria/b196-jas-vs-iswap-war-boko-haram-splinters\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Iswap is still locked in a violent turf war with Boko Haram</a>, with reports of deadly clashes between the two groups around Lake Chad earlier this month. In fact, Shekau is said to have killed himself during a battle with Iswap, exploding a suicide vest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains active and last week killed a Nigerian general, Brig Gen Musa Uba, after an ambush in Borno state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iswap commander Hussaini Ismaila was recently sentenced to 20 years in jail for multiple attacks in the northern city of Kano in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The north-eastern jihadist group was initially blamed for an attack on a Catholic church in the south-west of the country in June 2022 that killed at least 50 worshippers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors now believe it was a single cell linked to Somalia's al-Shabab jihadist group that was responsible. Five men are currently on trial for the attack and it is alleged they went to Somalia for training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind the two recent school kidnappings in the north-west of Nigeria in Kebbi and Niger states, but the government believes that Boko Haram and Iswap are behind them, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is a claim disputed by some experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits,\" conflict analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ansaru - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This splinter group has moved away from the north-east, where Boko Haram and Iswap dominate, to carry out its operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have participated in the 2022 attack on a high-speed train travelling between the capital, Abuja - in the centre of the country - and the city of Kaduna, about 200km (124 miles) north, in which at least seven people were killed and more than 100 commuters were abducted for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, Khalid al-Barnawi, was arrested in 2016 and is facing trial over several attacks, including the 2011 bombing of the UN building in Abuja. His trial is scheduled to resume in December 2025.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mahmuda - suspected Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Believed to be a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, it has set up in rural areas around Kainji Lake National Park in the west of the country since around 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is linked to the Islamic State group and has emphasised more moderate messaging in comparison to Boko Haram and proselytises in Hausa and other local languages to attract recruits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has carried out targeted killings, often riding in on motorcycles and attacking markets, vigilante groups set up to protect villagers from bandits and local communities in the western state of Kwara. In April, its fighters killed several vigilantes and attacked a market there, killing Fulani men and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their recent focus has shifted slightly north of Kwara - to Niger and Kebbi states - areas long plagued by bandit violence, where the two recent school abductions occurred.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lakurawa - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A relatively new Islamist militant group, Lakurawa has been attacking communities in Sokoto and Kebbi states in the north-west and in Niger, the country which borders Nigeria to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say it maintains ties with jihadist networks in Mali and Niger, and members have settled among border communities, marrying locally and recruiting young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially presenting itself as a protector against the bandits that roam the north-west, the group has gradually imposed harsh controls - such as checking villagers' phones for music, which is banned as it is considered un-Islamic, and flogging offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was declared a terrorist organisation in 2025 and accused of cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacking top government officials.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">JNIM - Sahel jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Active mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso, where it controls large areas, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), may be making inroads into Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A confirmed JNIM attack in northern Benin early in 2025 occurred close to the Nigerian border. In October 2025, the group claimed what would be its first attack inside Nigeria, in Kwara - the same state where more than 30 worshippers were abducted from a church last week and which has also seen increasing incursions by bandits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If JNIM activities are confirmed, it would complicate an already dire situation in parts of the country where Ansaru, Lakurawa, Mahmuda and the bandits are all active.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Herders v farmers - battles over resources</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This long-running conflict in central Nigeria - also known as the Middle Belt - has devastated communities, fuelling displacement and the spread of small arms as both herders and farmers arm themselves for what has become a deadly cycle of reprisal attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been framed by some as a religious fight, but the central grievance is over grazing rights - access to land and water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The herders are mainly Fulani Muslims, while the farmers are largely Christians from various ethnic communities, although some are Muslim. Fulani families traditionally walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find land for their prized cattle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But urbanisation has seen encroachment onto these age-old grazing routes and locals accuse the Fulani of letting their cattle trample their crops and forcing them out of their homes and fields.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notable clashes have taken place in Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states. In order to try and curb the violence, some state governments have imposed anti-open grazing laws and set up ranches for the herders - but have faced resistance from all sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fallout from the conflict is the establishment of ethnic militias that, in some cases, have turned to criminality, plundering the people they ostensibly claim to be protecting. Ethnic Tiv militias in Benue have been accused carrying out mass killings and some of their leaders have been killed or arrested by the security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ipob - separatist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The separatist violence in the south-east has its roots in calls for Biafran independence that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51094093\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">date back nearly 60 years to the brutal civil war that led to the deaths of up to a million people</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rebellion was crushed but demands for an independent state for the Igbo people of the region continued as some Igbos continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), led by Nnamdi Kanu, is one of the groups promoting that call for secession. In 2009 Kanu launched Radio Biafra that broadcast separatist messages to Nigeria from London. Ipob was designated as terrorist organisation in 2017 - and three years later Kanu created an armed wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Eastern Security Network (ESN), as it was called, and other splinter groups have since been implicated in arson, kidnappings and killings of civilians and security personnel in five states across the south-east. ESN has been in control of several towns in Imo and Anambra states where thousands were forced from their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the separatists, who have killed many prominent people in the south-east, have imposed a stay-at-home order on Mondays, causing much economic hardship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg42y7kevdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Simon Ekpa, leader of a breakaway faction of Ipob called Biafra Republic Government In Exile, was convicted in Finland of terrorism</a> and other activities in Nigeria's south-east.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3z38e6v45o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kanu was convicted in Nigeria on terrorism-related charges</a> and given a life sentence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the judgement, he had written to Trump urging the US to investigate \"killings of Christians and Igbo people\" and his group and others have been promoting the \"Christian genocide\" narrative in America, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://search.justice.gov/search?query=Nnamdi+Kanu&amp;op=Search&amp;affiliate=justice_fara\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a BBC investigation into documents filed with the US justice department shows</a>.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">You may also be interested in:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Matías Zibell García Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez leaning on tyres at his garage\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Matías Zibell García</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Business has boomed for mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This accounts \"for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Añelo's size and population has soared over the past decade</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won't be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Roads in and around Añelo are now busy with traffic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,\" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One resident, Mr Chung, told the BBC he got a panicked phone call on Wednesday afternoon from his wife saying she couldn't get out of their flat with their cat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He rushed home from work to find the 31-storey building in flames, with black smoke billowing out of it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Chung said he and his wife kept calling each other, anxious and scared. She told him she was about to faint as the smoke got thicker and thicker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She probably did faint,\" Mr Chung told BBC Chinese on Thursday, his eyes red from tears. \"I dare not call her again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that hours had passed since they spoke, he was braced for the worst. \"She passed away with our cat, who she loves,\" he said, breaking down in tears.

a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have not mentioned scaffolding as having caused or fuelled the rapid spread of the fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were \"relatively old\" - they were built in the 1980s - so \"the glass windows are not that fire resilient\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jack-lau,-bbc-global-china-unit-and-gemini-cheng,-bbc-chinese-in-hong-kong.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jack Lau, BBC Global China Unit and Gemini Cheng, BBC Chinese in Hong Kong.</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"
