Trump said Iranian leaders had called him \"to negotiate\", but added that the US \"may have to act before a meeting\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Frustration over the collapse of the Iranian currency and economic mismanagement has expanded into a crisis of legitimacy for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said an Iranian official had also contacted Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, adding that Tehran's public stance is \"quite [different] from the messages the administration is receiving privately\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, she warned that the US president is \"unafraid to use military options if and when he deems necessary\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two sources, who requested anonymity to discuss national security matters with CBS, said that any US military response in Iran will likely involve air power, but that planners are also considering options to disrupt Iranian command structures and communications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has urged its citizens in Iran to leave or have a plan to depart the country that does not require US government assistance. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How could Trump respond to Iran crackdown?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khamenei accused the US of \"deceit\" and relying on \"treacherous mercenaries\", while praising state-organised pro-government rallies held in Iran on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the \"Iranian nation is a powerful one, is aware and knows its enemies and is present in every scene\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">State media said large crowds gathered in several cities following calls for pro-government demonstrations. BBC Persian has seen text messages inviting people inside the country to attend these demonstrations, while also warning them not to take part in anti-government protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately on Monday, Trump said on his Truth Social platform he would impose a 25% tariff on goods from countries that are \"doing business\" with Tehran, without elaborating.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This order is final and conclusive,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran, already under severe US sanctions, faces a collapsing currency and inflation that has pushed food prices up by as much as 70%. Food makes up about one-third of Iran's imports, and further restrictions, caused by the tariffs, could worsen shortages and costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House did not share additional information about the tariffs. China is Iran's largest trading partner, followed by Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move could put more pressure on Tehran as the Iranian government escalates a crackdown on anti-government demonstrations.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: US should intervene ‘sooner’ to curb Iran protest deaths, says Reza Pahlavi</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Reza Pahlavi, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62wx1gr8y4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the son of Iran's last shah</a> who lives in exile in the US, has urged Trump to intervene \"sooner\" to limit the number of deaths among protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CBS News, Pahlavi said the current Iranian government was \"trying to trick the world into thinking that (it) is ready to negotiate once again\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He described Trump as \"a man that means what he says and says what he means\" and who \"knows what's at stake\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the president has a decision to make fairly soon,\" Pahlavi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 648 protesters in Iran have been killed, including nine people under the age of 18, according to Norway-based human rights group Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO). Sources inside Iran have told the BBC the death toll could be much higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran. An internet blackout since Thursday evening has made it difficult to obtain and verify information. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

She insists she has not committed \"the slightest irregularity\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the appeal, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be \"deeply worrying for democracy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella said he would not stand for president next year but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister.   </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case at the Paris Court of Appeal will last until 12 February but a ruling is not expected before the summer, well ahead of next year's presidential vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year's case centred on charges that Le Pen, along with more than 20 other senior party figures, hired assistants who worked on her RN party affairs rather than for the European Parliament which paid them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The judge, Bénédicte de Perthuis, said Le Pen had been at the \"heart of the system\" that saw the embezzlement of €2.9m (£2.5m) worth of European funds.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Le Pen was given a four-year prison sentence – with two years suspended and the remaining two to be served with an electronic tag rather than in custody. She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office \"with immediate effect\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If she loses her appeal she could face an even longer jail term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing journalists on the eve of the appeal trial in the presence of Le Pen, Bardella said the RN leader would prove her innocence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be deeply worrying for democracy if the justice system were to deprive the French people of a presidential candidate, already qualified twice for the second round and now considered the undisputed favourite in the election,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Le Pen will be hoping the appeals court overturns the lower-court's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the \"immediate effect\" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the presidential election expected around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements. </p></div></div></body></html>"

She also promised they could avoid combat roles if they paid her $3,000 (£2,227) each from their sign-up payments, he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f4f/live/f1c8ca40-ed50-11f0-ae21-ad55904e2b54.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images A large blast of white and orange flame coming from a Ukrainian tank, as it fires towards Russian positions in a snowy landscape in the Donetsk region in January 2024\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Roman Chop/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Omar described fierce fighting and frequent explosions on the front line</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he says, within about a month, he was on the front line with, he says, just 10 days' training and no military experience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're 100% going to die here,\" he says in one of his voice notes, sent to the BBC investigative team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of injuries, a lot of explosions, a lot of shelling.

Her posts have often told readers wanting to apply to join the Russian military to send her a scan of their passport. She has then posted invitation documents, sometimes with a list of names of the men they are for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has identified more than 490 such invitations that she has sent over the past year to men from countries including Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Iraq, Ivory Coast and Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her posts have mentioned recruitment for an \"elite international battalion\" and made it clear that people in Russia illegally - including those whose visas have expired - are eligible.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><b id=\"outside-the-uk,-watch-the-film-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Outside the UK, watch the film on </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7ruSvJfn_g\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><b id=\"youtube\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">YouTube</b></a><b id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">.</b></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We have spoken to eight foreign fighters including Omar who were recruited by her, as well as the families of the 12 men who are missing or dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many felt Azarnykh had misled or exploited recruits. They told us the men knew they were joining the military, but did not expect to serve on the front line.

About a year later, Yousef says a message arrived on Telegram from a Russian number, containing images of Mohammed's body.

He was willing to be filmed but spoke under a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Habib says he and Azarnykh \"worked together for around three years on visa invitations to Russia\". He gave no further details and we have not been able to confirm his role in the process. An image   from social media in 2024 shows him alongside her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Azarnykh, who is from Russia's south-western Voronezh region, ran a Facebook group helping Arab students come to Moscow to study, before starting her Telegram channel in 2024.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Habib told the BBC: \"Polina would take the men, knowing that they were going to die\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Habib says most foreign recruits arrived expecting roles securing facilities or standing at checkpoints. \"The Arabs who are coming are dying immediately. Some people lost their minds - it's hard to see dead bodies,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Habib says he met Omar and the group of Syrians at a military training site. \"She had promised them citizenship, good salaries and that they'd be safe,\" Habib says. \"But once you sign a contract here, there's no way you can leave.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"None of them knew how to use a weapon. Even if they were shot at, they would choose not to shoot back… if you don't shoot, you will be killed,\" he says. \"Polina would take the men, knowing that they were going to die.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says she \"received $300 (£223) from the army for every person she recruited\". The BBC could not confirm this, although other recruits also told us they believed she received payment.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Nothing happens for free'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Azarnykh's posts from mid-2024 begin to note that recruits will be \"participating in hostilities\" and mention foreign fighters who have died in combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You all understood well that you were going to war,\" she says in one video in October 2024. \"You thought that you could get a Russian passport, do nothing and live in a five-star hotel?... Nothing happens for free.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another case, in 2024, the BBC has heard a voice message sent by Azarnykh to a mother whose son was serving in the military.  Azarnykh says the woman has \"published something horrible about the Russian army\". Using expletives, she threatens the son's life and warns the woman: \"I'll find you and all your children.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC made multiple attempts to contact Azarnykh. Initially she said she would do an interview with us if we travelled to Russia, but the BBC declined for safety reasons. Later, when asked in a voice call about claims that recruits were promised non-combat roles, she hung up. In voice notes sent afterwards, she said our work was \"not professional\" and warned of potential defamation proceedings. She also said: \"Our respected Arabs can stick their accusations up their arses.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC contacted the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Defence for comment, but received no response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously, in March 2022 President Putin backed the recruitment of men from the Middle East, insisting they were ideologically, not financially, driven: \"There are people who want to come voluntarily, especially not for money, and provide assistance to people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab9/live/8b918be0-efc6-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Telegram Azarnykh in a dark coat standing next to nine people in military clothing, with dense forest in the background.

One includes posts showing invitation documents and lists of names, the other has advertised large sign-up payments for joining an \"elite battalion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Kenyan police said they had broken up a suspected \"trafficking syndicate\" that they said was luring Kenyans with job offers, but sending them to fight in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kateryna Stepanenko, a research fellow at the Institute for the Study of War, told the BBC some municipal and regional authorities in Russia have been offering cash incentives of up to $4,000 (£2,970) to individuals such as HR professionals and local residents who recruit Russians or foreigners into military service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says the Kremlin initially used larger entities such as the Wagner private military group and prison system for recruitment, but since 2024 has also been \"leveraging locals and smaller companies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This \"suggests to me that those earlier versions of recruitment are no longer generating the same number of recruits\", she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Habib is now back in Syria after, he says, having bribed several commanders to terminate his contract.

Then Saturday night it became much, much quieter,\" a resident of Tehran told BBC Persian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You would have to have a death wish to go out now,\" one Iranian journalist reflected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time, an internal upheaval is also compounded by an external threat, with President Trump's repeated warnings of military action coming seven months after the US carried out strikes on key nuclear facilities during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, which left the regime weakened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, to use an analogy often used by the American leader, that has also given Iran \"another card\" to play.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump now says Tehran has called to go back to the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Iran doesn't have a good hand: President Trump says he may still have to take some kind of action before any meeting; talks won't take all the searing heat out of this unrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Iran won't capitulate to what have been the US's maximalist demands, including zero nuclear enrichment, which would cross red lines which lie at the very heart of this theocracy's strategic doctrine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whatever the pressure of this moment, there's no sign Iran's leaders are changing course.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mortuary videos shows violent government crackdown in Iran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their inclination is to clamp down, to try to survive this moment, and then to figure out where they go from here,\" says Vali Nasr from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, author of the book Iran's Grand Strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But given their straits with the US, with Israel, with sanctions, even if they quell these protests, they don't have many options to improve the lives of Iranians.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week may decide the momentum in this moment - whether Iran, and the wider region, is plunged into another bout of military attacks; whether brute force has completely put down these protests – as it has in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told diplomats in Tehran today that \"the situation is now under total control\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside, in the bright light of day, the streets of Tehran were filled with the crowds the government called on to come out and reclaim the streets from protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five days into a comprehensive communications blackout, a more chilling picture still sneaks out into the world through Starlink satellite terminals, Iranian technical creativity, and courage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Doctors' accounts of hospitals overwhelmed by casualties, grim videos of open-air mortuaries dotted by long lines of black body bags, voice notes sent to journalists at the BBC Persian Service expressing shock and fear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The numbers rise. In the last wave of unrest in 2022 and 2023, which lasted more than six months, around 500 deaths were recorded by human rights groups and more than 20,000 arrests. This time, within a few weeks, reports say the death toll already climbs far higher and more than 20,000 have been taken in so far. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government doesn't deny the bloodshed; state TV is also airing  images of makeshift mortuaries, even admitting some protesters have been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The streets of Iran have been on fire. Government buildings have been set alight as anger burned. They are symbols of the system, but attacks on public property are condemned by the government as the work of \"terrorists and rioters. \"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Legal language has also hardened in this time -  \"vandals \" will be charged with \"waging war against God\" and face the death penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government puts the main blame  on foreign enemies - code name for Israel and the US - for an internal upsurge. This time, their accusation is also fuelled by the clear extent of infiltration by Israel's Mossad security agency during their 12-day war last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With every new eruption of unrest in Iran, the same questions are asked: how far and wide do these protests reach; who's taking to the streets and squares; how will the authorities respond?</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5d1d/live/ef8a4290-efda-11f0-be9a-5d00009628a6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A vehicle burns during protests in Tehran, Iran, on January 8, 2026. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The authorities are trying to regain control in Iran following weeks of protests </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This latest wave has been unique in many ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It began in a most ordinary way. On 28 December, traders selling imported electronic goods in Tehran were jolted by the sudden currency collapse; they shuttered their shops, went on strike, and urged others in the bazaar to follow suit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's initial response was quick and conciliatory. President Masoud Pezeshkian promised dialogue and acknowledged \"legitimate demands\" in a country where inflation soars near 50%, and currency depreciations play havoc with people's hardscrabble lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new monthly allowance, amounting to about $7 (£5), was soon deposited in everyone's bank account to help ease the pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prices shot up further; the wave of unrest swelled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Less than three weeks later, Iranians were marching everywhere - from small deprived provincial towns to major cities, chanting for economic and political change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no quick and simple fixes now; it's the system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran is broken by years of crippling international sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, deep seated rage over restrictions on social freedoms, and agony over the cost of this prolonged standoff with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, so far, the centre appears to be holding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The most important element still missing from a full collapse is repressive forces deciding that they no longer benefit from, and are no longer willing to kill for, the regime,\" explains Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before this crisis erupted, the most powerful players in Iran's ruling circles were known to be bitterly divided on key issues: if and how to resume the ill-fated negotiations with the US over a new nuclear deal, as well as how to restore strategic deterrence after the blows to its military proxies and political partners during the Gaza war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But survival of the system, their system, matters above all else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimate authority still rests with the ailing 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but he's encircled by his most loyal defenders, among them the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), who now hold sway over the economy, politics and security of the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump's almost daily threats are known to have concentrated minds at the top. It has also provoked speculation far and wide over the impact of any outside intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Military action could bolster the protesters; it could also backfire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The primary impact would be to shore up elite unity and suppress fractures within the regime at a moment of heightened vulnerability,\" says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, poses after an interview with Reuters about the situation in Iran and the need to support Iranians, in Paris, France, June 23, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's former shah, is among those calling on the US to intervene</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the loudest Iranian voices calling on President Trump to intervene has been the exiled former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown as Iran's shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution. But his call, and his close ties to Israel, are controversial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other voices, from Nobel peace laureate Narges Mohammadi - still imprisoned in Iran, to award-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, insist that change must be peaceful,  and must come from within.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this current unrest, Pahlavi has shown his capacity to help galvanise and give shape to this uprising. His appeals at the start of last week for coordinated chanting appear to have drawn more people out into the bitter winter cold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's impossible to know the depth of his support, and whether this profound yearning for change leads some to hold fast to a familiar symbol. Iran's pre-revolutionary flag, with its lion and sun, has been unfurled again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi emphasises he's not trying to bring back the monarchy but to lead a democratic transition; but in the past he has not been a unifying figure in the divided Iranian diaspora.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fears of collapse and chaos, financial woes, and more, also weigh on the minds of Iranians including those who still back the ruling clerics. Reform not revolution is on some minds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">History tells us that when fervour and force meet on the streets, change can come from above, or below. It is always unpredictable - and often perilous.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But Trump declined to endorse Machado, whose movement claimed victory in 2024's widely contested elections, as its new leader. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado said last week she hoped to thank Trump personally for the action against Maduro and would like to give the Nobel Prize to him. Trump called it  \"a great honour\", but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier, Trump had expressed displeasure over Machado's decision to accept the  Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the president has long coveted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked on Friday whether receiving Machado's prize might change his view of her role in Venezuela, the president said: \"She might be involved in some aspect of it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I will have to speak to her. I think it's very nice that she wants to come in. And that's what I understand the reason is,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, after Maduro's ouster, Trump had said Machado \"doesn't have the support within, or the respect within, the country\". \"She's a very nice woman, but she doesn't have the respect,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has so far backed Delcy Rodríguez  as Venezuela's interim president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump describes Rodríguez as an \"ally\", and she has not been charged by US officials with any crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Delcy Rodríguez and her team have been very cooperative with the United States,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Machado has maintained that her coalition should \"absolutely\" be in charge of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado has said nobody trusted Rodríguez, telling CBS that the interim leader was \"one of the main architects... of repression for innocent people\" in the South American country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everybody in Venezuela and abroad knows perfectly who she is and the role she has played,\" Machado said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former legislator, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, described US military action in Venezuela as \"a major step towards restoring prosperity and rule of law and democracy in Venezuela\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez has rebuffed claims by Trump that the US was in charge of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan government rules our country, and no-one else does,\" she said in a televised speech. \"There is no external agent governing Venezuela.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Justice Department has been contacted for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday.  He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Powell called the investigation \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" Powell said. \"Those are pretexts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ probe \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\", Powell said in his statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job,\" Leavitt said. \"As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: The unusual move Powell made in disclosing criminal investigation</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was \"extremely chilling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" Yellen told CNBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She suggested investors should be concerned about the development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is expected to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">name someone in the coming weeks</a> to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global markets also proved \"remarkably resilient\" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlkxjm88ko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an \"unnecessary distraction\" and it could \"undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I think that's where you have problems,\" former FBI special agent Robert D'Amico said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Officials cite video footage</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local and federal officials have both cited video footage of the incident to support their interpretations of the event. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple angles show ICE agents approaching a car in the middle of the street and asking the driver - Good - to get out. One of the agents then tugs at the driver's side door handle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the vehicle begins to move forward, an agent stood in front of the car - Ross, who was also filming - points and shoots at Good. The car turns away from the officers and crashes on the side of the road.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local and state officials say the videos demonstrate that Good was not a threat as she was turning away from the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials, meanwhile, say the videos are evidence that Good was trying to drive her car into the officer and that his only choice was to use deadly force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former law enforcement officials told the BBC that judgements from both sides of the argument should have been withheld until a full investigation had been completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a politically charged situation where people on both the left and on the right have come to their conclusions before the investigation even started,\" said Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and a professor at the University of New Haven's Criminal Justice Department.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Justifying deadly force</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock A woman wearing a dark jacket with a hood over her head holds a candle and a picture of a Minneapolis woman fatally shot by an agent of ICE, the US  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The shooting last week led to protests around the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When analysing whether the ICE officer was justified in shooting Good, investigators will have to compare Ross's actions in the videos to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policy on the use of deadly force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former law enforcement agents said a previous episode in which Ross was injured on duty - as well as the quick determinations he had to make about the threat level - will likely be seen by federal investigators as providing that official justification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under DHS policy, agents are authorised to use deadly force if they believe they are at risk of death, imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm, Gray said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A specific clause states that officers cannot fire at a moving vehicle unless someone in the car is threatening the officer or unless the vehicle is \"operated in a manner that threatens to cause death or serious physical injury\" and \"no other objectively reasonable means of defence appear to exist, which includes moving out of the path of the vehicle\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the policy, officers are allowed to shoot at a threatening person inside the vehicle, but they cannot try to stop the car by shooting it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gray said Good may not have been purposely trying to run over the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But from the point of view of the officer or agent, all he knows is that this car is about to hit him,\" he said. \"If I were placed in the same situation, I think I would have shot.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials conducting the review will also consider that, just months earlier, Ross was dragged by a car and injured after confronting someone else in a vehicle. The incident could have convinced him Good was a similar threat, law enforcement experts said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">D'Amico said that even if officials determine Ross's first shot at Good was justified, it might be harder to justify the second and third rounds Ross appeared to fire after the vehicle pulled away from him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that it would have been easy to find justification to use deadly force during arrests made during his own career, such as when a suspect reached for an unspecified object. But that did not mean such force was always the best course of action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think they're going to find that (the shooting) was justified,\" said D'Amico. \"But just because you can take the shot doesn't mean you should.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Reconstructing the scene</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their review process, federal agents will also examine evidence beyond the videos, including reconstructing the scene physically and digitally, said Christopher Piehota, former head of the FBI Science and Technology Programs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness accounts, background information about Ross and Good and details about what else was going on that morning will help them examine what Piehota called the \"totality\" of the circumstances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota officials have said the federal government has blocked them from participating in the investigation. And Governor Tim Walz has expressed concerns that a probe conducted only by federal officials could be biased. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local officials have said they will conduct their own review.

I was angry because people thought I was sidelined based on injuries, when in reality, it was internal homophobia that kept me on the bench.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A change in management meant \"politics\" kept him off the pitch and limited his career opportunities, Cavallo said, also alleging a photo of him and his partner was mocked by his teammates in a group chat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the first time, I actually questioned if I should have kept my sexuality a secret.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for Adelaide United - which is due to take part in its fourth Pride Cup match on Saturday - said it was \"extremely disappointed by the claims made\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Adelaide United has always been committed to fostering an inclusive environment for players, staff and supporters, and we remain proud of our ongoing work to promote inclusion across football.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cavallo has previously spoken about receiving death threats on a near daily basis after his decision to publicly come out, but has said that his only regret is not coming out sooner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While former professional footballers or those in lower tiers have come out as gay before, Cavallo was the first to do so while actively playing in a premier league.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His 2021 revelation inspired Jake Daniels, who in 2022, at the age of 17, became the first British professional male footballer to come out in more than 30 years.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He's been our greatest ally in this situation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, pointing to the small number of people released so far, Guanipa warned Trump that \"if he thinks this is going alright, it is not\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Outside El Helicoide prisoners' relatives are keeping vigil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ramón Guanipa says he has only been allowed to visit his father once since the older man was arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Juan Pablo Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the result of the 2024 presidential election. That vote was lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the west of the country, to Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small,\" he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when his father was not among those freed, he felt \"defeated\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">El Helicoide prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers,\" Farfán says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an \"urgent\" step towards any transition of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-daniel-wittenberg.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Daniel Wittenberg.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead &amp; Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians.

He wrote \"RIP\" with a broken-heart emoji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Eagles guitarist Don Felder posted a lengthy tribute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship,\" Felder posted on Instagram with a photo of himself with Weir.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel so blessed to have been able to have him sing on 'Rock You' from American Rock and Roll.

Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the high-tech security fence into Israel at the start of the attack, landing in civilian areas where many residents died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 1,200 people were killed in the attack. It triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 71,419 people since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdel-Fattah confirmed to Australian broadcaster ABC that she had posted the image, but said she had done so before the true extent of the attacks was known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At that point, I had no idea about the death toll, I had no idea about what was happening on the ground... Of course, I do not support the killing of civilians,\" she told the ABC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The academic has been the target of public campaigns before. Opposition politicians and some prominent Jewish Australians called for research funding awarded to Abdel-Fattah to be cancelled in 2024. After a letter from Education Minister Jason Clare, the funding was suspended while Abdel-Fattah was investigated over allegations she had bent the grant's rules, though she was ultimately cleared last month.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f6d/live/236bef90-f00e-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Premier of South Australia Peter Malinauskas, wearing a navy suit and a white shirt, speaks to media\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">South Australia's premier Peter Malinauskas has backed the decision</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Norman Schueler, of the Jewish Community Council for South Australia, last week said his organisation had sent a letter to the Adelaide Festival board lobbying for Abdel-Fattah's removal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a very wise move and it will improve the cohesiveness of the festival by not having her there,\" he told the Adelaide Advertiser after her removal. Upon news of the growing walkout, he added: \"I think for everyone who has dropped out that it's rather pathetic because that means they agree with what Dr Fattah is on about... Namely, that Israel should not exist.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskus - whose government is a key backer of the festival - said that he \"wholeheartedly\" supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion and had \"absolutely made clear to the board that I did not think it was wise\" to invite her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Malinauskus denied having played any role in the board's decision, telling the ABC on Monday that, though he shared his opinion, he had not threatened to withdraw funding or sack anyone. He also denied that his position was influenced by Jewish lobby groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adler said the board's decision had been taken \"despite my strongest opposition\" and added: \"In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The board's statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism,\" she said. \"One doesn't have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of 'social cohesion' is propaganda.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After her appearance was cancelled, Abdel-Fattah said Australian arts and cultural institutions had displayed \"utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It isn't the first time Abdel-Fattah has been at the centre of the derailment of a writers' festival.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two days before it was due to begin in August last year, Bendigo Writers Festival issued a code of conduct requiring speakers to \"avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A subsequent walkout - led by Abdel-Fattah and others over concerns it could prevent free discussion of the Israel-Gaza war - led to the cancellation of around a third of the programme.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Allegations of hypocrisy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Abdel-Fattah has been accused of double standards, by sections of the media and Malinauskus, who claim that she had successfully demanded the exclusion of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman from the  Adelaide festival two years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter sent by her and nine other academics to the board followed his publication of a column in which he compared players in the Middle East to members of the animal kingdom, including caterpillars, wasps and spiders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Call it what you like, after the correspondence from Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, they removed a pro-Jewish Israeli speaker. Fast forward two years and I think it's reasonable for the board to apply the same principle,\" Malinauskus said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdel-Fattah rejected the allegations of hypocrisy, saying in a statement to the BBC that Friedman's article had \"compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of 'human animals' was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed 'culturally insensitive' and linked to the Bondi atrocity,\" her statement continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also denied that Friedman had been removed at her behest. In a letter dated February 2024 and quoted by Australian media, the board wrote that cancelling a writer was an \"extremely serious request\" and that while Friedman had been scheduled to attend he would no longer take part due to \"last-minute scheduling issues\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he was in fact quietly cancelled, it only underscores the racism of cancelling me in such a brazen and publicly humiliating manner,\" Abdel-Fattah said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Friedman for comment.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What have other writers said?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Jacinda Ardern wearing a linen blazer\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jacinda Ardern did not make a statement but confirmed her withdrawal on Monday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adler said at least 180 writers had withdrawn from the festival, devastating its programme.

But every hint of departure has been followed by constitutional amendments including the removal of presidential term limits and age limits - reforms that have enabled him to remain in office indefinitely,\" says political analyst Monday Akol Amazima.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, the clearest indications of an impending shift have surfaced inside the centres of power themselves, particularly within the armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of this is Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, whose growing prominence has recast long-standing questions about succession into more immediate and tangible ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His swift accumulation of authority, coupled with an increasingly public profile, has made the prospect of a hereditary transfer of power a central feature of political debate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After taking command of the land forces in 2021, Gen Kainerugaba's rise accelerated rapidly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the middle of the decade, he was overseeing the entire military, even as he cultivated a national following beyond the barracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, he traversed the country with a series of highly choreographed \"birthday\"  parties for himself that doubled as political rallies, before unveiling the Patriotic League of Uganda party, an organisation widely interpreted as a testing ground for his future political ambitions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite speculation that he might run for the presidency, he later declared allegiance to his father's re-election bid. However, his messaging continues to position him as a leader-in-waiting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shift became more pronounced in March 2024, when Gen Kainerugaba initiated sweeping changes within the senior ranks of the military. Such decisions had historically been the preserve of the presidency, not an active service chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By moving to reorder the command structure and improving retirement benefits, he signalled both an expansion of his authority and an effort to secure it, neutralising potential resistance while embedding loyalists in strategic roles across the security apparatus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet NRM spokesperson Dombo downplays suggestions that Museveni is grooming his son as an heir.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He insists the party has clear internal processes for leadership succession, adding that if Gen Kainerugaba were to express interest in a political position through the NRM, he would be required to follow those established channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether Gen Muhoozi would want to exploit his advantage as a military leader, he should also know that there are other things he must still prove, so that the combination of them can portray him as a leader he may choose to be,\" Dombo says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c40/live/85a5a150-ef97-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters A close-up of a stack of ballot boxes sealed with plastic ties.

The incident could have convinced him Good was a similar threat, law enforcement experts said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">D'Amico said that even if officials determine Ross's first shot at Good was justified, it might be harder to justify the second and third rounds Ross appeared to fire after the vehicle pulled away from him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that it would have been easy to find justification to use deadly force during arrests made during his own career, such as when a suspect reached for an unspecified object. But that did not mean such force was always the best course of action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think they're going to find that (the shooting) was justified,\" said D'Amico. \"But just because you can take the shot doesn't mean you should.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Reconstructing the scene</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their review process, federal agents will also examine evidence beyond the videos, including reconstructing the scene physically and digitally, said Christopher Piehota, former head of the FBI Science and Technology Programs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness accounts, background information about Ross and Good and details about what else was going on that morning will help them examine what Piehota called the \"totality\" of the circumstances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota officials have said the federal government has blocked them from participating in the investigation.

MGR and Jayalalithaa even became chief ministers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now Tamil superstar C Joseph Vijay, known as \"Thalapathy\" Vijay (General Vijay), is the latest to join the list. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in 2024 and soon after announced that he would retire from films to pursue politics full-time. His upcoming film this month, Jana Nayagan (The People's Hero), would be his farewell release, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vijay's reasoning was explicit: politics, he argued, is not something one can dabble in. Tamil Nadu's voters, he said, deserved nothing less than full commitment. And the state's political history supports that calculation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MGR and Jayalalithaa withdrew from active stardom before consolidating power. But Kamal Haasan's hybrid approach, which involves being active in cinema and politics both, has yielded limited electoral results. Vijayakanth's party rose quickly but faltered organisationally. Tamil politics has little patience for half-measures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is against this unforgiving backdrop that Jana Nayagan arrives. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Steeped in political imagery and rhetoric, Vijay's new film will open in nearly 5,000 cinemas across India and overseas this month. At 51, the star is stepping away from a career most actors would be reluctant to leave. He remains among Indian cinema's most bankable stars, driving festival releases and revenues across the global Tamil diaspora - from satellite rights and music to merchandise.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e40d/live/3f78e290-eedf-11f0-aa0d-d1c2c6b0da04.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"x Vijay taking a selfie at one of his rallies\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">x</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vijay launched his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam (TVK), in 2024</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chennai-based film critic Aditya Shrikrishna noted that Vijay's appeal has not rested on acting prowess alone. \"He's not a Kamal Haasan or Rajinikanth in terms of filmography,\" he said. \"But his box office pull and fandom are huge and undeniably influential. Dancing, comedy and a keen understanding of populist cinema are his strengths.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vijay's stardom, however, has never been accidental, said Pritham K Chakravarthy, film academic and critic. \"The seed was planted by his father who had Communist leanings and was keen on joining politics.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vijay began as a child actor in the 1980s and was launched as a lead actor in 1992 by his parents - filmmaker SA Chandrasekhar and singer-writer Shoba Chandrasekhar - with Naalaiya Theerpu. The film flopped, but his career did not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next three decades, he appeared in nearly 70 films, charting a carefully calibrated rise - from playing the romantic hero in his films in the late 1990s to acting as an angry young man in the 2000s to a carefully-honed image as saviour and vigilante in films after 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Vijay's early roles often leaned into hyper-masculine tropes, he later \"consciously course-corrected his image\", points out Shrikrishna. He later started projecting a saviour figure rooted in social justice in his movies. He spoke of farmers' distress in Kaththi, healthcare corruption in Mersal, supporting women's sports in Bigil and electoral manipulation in Sarkar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now it's a different Vijay. His on-screen persona as incorruptible, restrained, morally upright, mirrored the ethical imagination of Dravidian politics, a cinematic grammar Tamil audiences recognise instinctively,\" says Chakravarthy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Long before Vijay launched his party, his cinema had thus already done the ideological groundwork. Audio launches doubled as soft political addresses.
