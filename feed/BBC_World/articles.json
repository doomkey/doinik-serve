They have blamed the crisis on Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies to the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The facts are in - and they are undeniable. Palestinians in Gaza are enduring a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions,” UN Secretary General António Guterres said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is not a warning. It is a reality unfolding before our eyes. The trickle of aid must become an ocean. Food, water, medicine, and fuel must flow in waves and without obstruction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel imposed a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on the armed group to release its Israeli hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The blockade was partially eased after 11 weeks, after the Israeli government came under pressure from its allies, but the shortages of food, medicine and fuel have worsened.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has insisted there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is \"no starvation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, it has announced in recent days measures aimed at helping the UN and its partners collect aid from crossings and distribute it within Gaza, including daily \"tactical pauses\" in military operations in three areas and designated corridors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC says immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for an unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report does not formally classify Gaza as being in a famine, saying that can only be made through analysis that will be conducted \"without delay\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC - a global initiative by UN agencies, aid groups and governments - is the primary mechanism the international community uses to conclude whether a famine is happening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Households are classified as IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) if they experience an extreme lack of food, starvation and exhaustion of coping strategies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a famine to be officially declared in a specific area, there must be evidence that:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">At least 20% of households are in Phase 5</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">At least 30% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">There are two deaths for every 10,000 inhabitants per day, or four child deaths out of 10,000 children, \"due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease\"</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, the IPC warned the entire population of Gaza was facing high levels of acute food insecurity and that 470,000 people (22%) were facing \"catastrophic\" levels, or Phase 5.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC alert issued on Tuesday says the intensification of the Israeli military's bombardment and expansion of its ground operations over the past two months have had a \"devastating impact\" on civilians and critical infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">People's access to food across Gaza has also become \"alarmingly erratic and extremely perilous\" during the same period, it adds, noting the UN has recorded the killing of more than 1,000 people seeking aid by Israeli forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC says malnutrition has been rising rapidly in the first half of July and has reached the famine threshold in Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It cites the Gaza Nutrition Cluster - which is made up of UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations - as saying more than 20,000 children have been admitted to clinics for acute malnutrition between April and mid-July, with more than 3,000 severely malnourished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says hospitals have also reported a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths of children under five years of age, with at least 16 reported deaths since 17 July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC alert calls for immediate action to be taken to \"alleviate the catastrophic suffering\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This includes scaling up the flow of goods, restoring basic services, and ensuring safe, unimpeded access to sufficient life-saving assistance,\" it says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"None of this is possible unless there is a ceasefire.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The World Food Programme and Unicef expressed alarm that two famine thresholds - food consumption and acute malnutrition - had been breached in parts of Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They warned that collecting robust data on the third threshold - starvation-related deaths - under the current circumstances in Gaza was \"very difficult as health systems, already decimated by nearly three years of conflict, are collapsing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said another 14 people had died as a result of malnutrition over the previous 24 hours. That brought the number of malnutrition-related deaths since the war began to 147, including 88 children, according to the ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The World Health Organization also said on Sunday there had been 63 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza this month, including 24 children under five. It noted that the bodies of most of the dead showed \"clear signs of severe wasting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The unbearable suffering of the people of Gaza is already clear for the world to see. Waiting for official confirmation of famine to provide life-saving food aid they desperately need is unconscionable,\" said the WFP's executive director, Cindy McCain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We need to flood Gaza with large-scale food aid, immediately and without obstruction, and keep it flowing each and every day to prevent mass starvation. People are already dying of malnutrition, and the longer we wait to act, the higher the death toll will rise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">WFP and Unicef said \"barely a trickle\" of what was needed by Gaza's population had entered since Israel partially eased its blockade, and that more than 62,000 tonnes of aid - the equivalent of approximately 3,100 lorry loads - was required every month just to cover basic humanitarian food and nutrition assistance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At a news conference in Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the situation in Gaza was \"tough\" but that it was a \"lie\" that Israel was deliberately starving the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Who is responsible for this tough reality?... This is Hamas,\" he declared. \"Whether there is a starvation policy? No, the contrary is right.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Saar said 5,000 aid lorries had entered Gaza over the last two months, and that Israel was making \"amazing efforts, including this week, by opening these humanitarian corridors, by airdrops by any possible means\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli military body Cogat, which co-ordinates the entry of aid into Gaza, said more than 200 lorry loads were collected from crossings by the UN and other international organisations on Monday, and hundreds more were awaiting collection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Gaza residents said they had seen little to no improvement in the availability of food since Israel announced the new measures to facilitate aid distribution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[On Monday] they airdropped a very small amount of aid in our area. Thousands of people fought over it,\" mother-of-two Bakr Salah, 35, a nurse at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My children are starving. They have not eaten a single meal for two days. We keep hearing about aid coming in, but we never see any of it,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the southern city of Khan Younis, Bilal Atallah, a 45-year-old father of five, said he had spent all of Monday waiting for food aid without success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I had no choice but to buy flour from the looters who had stolen it from aid lorries,\" he said. \"It cost me $35 (£26) for 1kg (2.2lb) of flour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Other Gaza residents also reported that criminal gangs were intercepting and looting aid convoys, and then reselling supplies at unaffordable prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said most UN lorries that entered Gaza on Sunday were looted, but said it was by \"desperate individual civilians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of stealing aid. However, the New York Times cited senior Israeli military officials as saying on Sunday that the military had never found proof that the armed group had systematically stolen aid from the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reuters news agency also reported last week that internal US government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by Hamas of US-funded aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 60,034 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Record heatwaves hit the country's eastern region earlier this month while floods swept the country's southwest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Against the backdrop of the massive floods in northern China, President Xi Jinping has called for \"all-out\" rescue efforts and told authorities to prepare for \"worst-case and extreme scenarios\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"No effort should be spared to search for and rescue those missing or trapped, to transfer and resettle residents in affected areas, and to reduce casualties to the greatest extent possible,\" the president said on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chinese authorities have allocated 200 million yuan ($28m; £21m) for recovery efforts, including repairing transportation and other infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The outskirts of Beijing, including the suburban districts of Miyun and Huairou, were hit hardest by the torrential rain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The floods have damaged dozens of roads and disrupted power to more than 130 villages.

Her family had also been taking care of her pets: eight cats and three dogs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their village is small and remote, with just around 10 households, she said, adding that she feared rescuers might miss it altogether. Out of desperation, she took to social media to appeal for rescue, hoping they would be found soon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Residents from flood-hit areas recalled how quickly the disaster unfolded. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The flood came rushing in, just like that, so fast and suddenly,\" Zhuang Zhelin, a shop-owner in Taishitun town, near Beijing, told the Associated Press. \"In no time at all, the place was filling up.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zhuang's neighbour told the Associated Press that when the floods came he \"just ran upstairs and waited for rescue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I remember thinking, if no one came to get us, we'd be in real trouble,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing is no stranger to flooding, particularly at this time of year. One of the deadliest in recent memory occurred in July 2012, when 190mm of rain drenched the city in a day, killing 79 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This summer, floods have wreaked havoc across swathes of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two people were killed and 10 people went missing in Shandong province earlier this month when Typhoon Wipha struck eastern China. Two weeks earlier, a landslide killed three people in Ya'an city, southwestern China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Extreme weather, which experts link to climate change, has increasingly threatened China's residents and economy - especially its trillion-dollar agriculture sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Natural disasters in the first half of the year have cost China 54.11 billion yuan ($7.5bn; £5.7bn), its emergency management ministry said earlier this month.

Uribe is expected to appeal the verdict, having always maintained his innocence.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Uribe is best known for mounting an aggressive offensive against leftist guerrilla group the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) during his tenure. He has always denied ties to right-wing paramilitaries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The former president sat shaking his head as the verdict was read out, AFP reported, in the trial that has seen more than 90 witnesses testify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has condemned the court's decision, accusing the country's judiciary of being weaponised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The former president's \"only crime has been to tirelessly fight and defend his homeland,\" he wrote on the social media site, X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The result comes more than a decade after Uribe was first charged in 2012. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At that time, he accused a left-wing senator, Ivan Cepeda, of a plot against him. Uribe claimed Cepeda wanted to falsely link him to right-wing paramilitary groups involved in Colombia's internal armed conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the country's Supreme Court dismissed the former president's claims against Cepeda, instead investigating Uribe for the ties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The former president was then accused of contacting jailed ex-fighters and bribing them to deny connections to the paramilitary groups - tampering with key witnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Uribe said he had wanted to convince the ex-fighters to tell the truth.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Paramilitary groups emerged in Colombia in the 1980s with the stated goal of taking on poverty and marginalisation. They fought the Marxist-inspired guerrilla groups that had themselves battled the state two decades prior. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the armed groups which developed in the standoff made an income from the cocaine trade. Violent and deadly fighting between them and with the state has produced lasting rivalries for trafficking routes and resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Uribe was praised by Washington for his hard-line approach to Farc rebels – but was a divisive politician whose critics say did little to improve the inequality and poverty in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Farc signed a peace deal with Uribe's successor in 2016 though violence from disarmed groups persists in Colombia. </p></div></div></body></html>"

The BBC hasn't been able to verify any of Silent Crow's claims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the Russian prosecutor's office confirmed there had been \"a failure in the operation of the Aeroflot information system as a result of a hacker attack\" and said a criminal investigation had been opened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A number of passengers would be transferred to flights operated by other carriers, the transport ministry said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian hacking groups have been extremely active since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but it is hard to know when their boasts about various cyber-attacks are backed up with facts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These gangs are often run by volunteers who target organisations and exaggerate their attacks to make headlines and degrade enemy morale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This attack is a rare one that is having a visible and immediate impact on a major Russian company, affecting tens of thousands of civilians as well as the firm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Silent Crow said they worked with the long-established Belarusian hacker group Cyber Partisans, which has been carrying out attacks against targets in Russia and Belarus since 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky called the intervention \"extremely significant\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two weeks ago, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdv20v9lp1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Trump said President Vladimir Putin had 50 days</a> to end the war or Russia would face severe tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking at a news conference in Scotland, Trump said he would confirm the new deadline on Monday or Tuesday, but reiterated the threat to impose sanctions and secondary tariffs on Moscow. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky thanked Trump for the adjusted deadline, saying it came \"right on time\" in a social media post on X. He praised the US president's \"clear stance and expressed determination\" on \"saving lives and stopping this horrible war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier in July he said those would amount to 100% tax imposed on any country that trades with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This would make the goods so expensive that US businesses would likely choose to buy them cheaper from elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for both Russia and the country that trades with it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking after a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, Trump again expressed his disapproval at Putin's actions in Ukraine, where war rages on three and a half years into Russia's full-scale invasion. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While he refused to say whether he felt Putin had been \"lying\" to him, Trump highlighted the contrast between the Russian president's rhetoric during their one-on-one conversations and the missiles \"lobbed\" on Ukrainian cities on a near-nightly basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were going to have a ceasefire and maybe peace... and all of a sudden you have missiles flying into Kyiv and other places,\" Trump lamented, adding that he thought  negotiations would be possible but that it was now \"very late down the process\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I say, forget it. I'm not gonna talk anymore. This has happened on too many occasions and I don't like it,\" he said, though he also insisted that he and Putin always got along very well. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2830/live/f34a5340-6bc1-11f0-aecb-f793dee9bba5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Trump, wearing a blue suit jacket, red tie and white shirt, pointing at something off-camera while sat in the ballroom of his Turnbury golfing resort in Scotland\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Trump refused to say whether he felt Putin had been \"lying\" to him</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump also said he was \"no longer interested in talks\" - a line which instantly flashed up on major Russian media outlets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin has never commented on the timeframe. When the initial 50 days deadline was first announced, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov merely labelled it as \"very serious\" but added that Moscow needed time to analyse it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Referring to the latest developments on Monday afternoon, Russian MP Andrey Gurulyov said Trump's ultimatums \"didn't work anymore... not on the front line, not in Moscow\" and that Russia had the force of its \"weapons, principles and will\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Trump first mentioned shortening the deadline Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak praised him for \"delivering a clear message of peace through strength\" and added that Putin \"respects only power\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent months Russia has ramped up its attacks on Ukraine, launching swarms of drones and missiles on cities while pressing on with its summer offensive in the east of the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three rounds of ceasefire talks between Russia and Ukraine hosted by Turkey have resulted in thousands of prisoners of war being exchanged - but no real progress was made towards agreeing a ceasefire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After three and a half years of bloody conflict, it is unclear how the two sides could possibly reach an agreement to stop the fighting within 12 days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">All of Russia's preconditions for peace - including Ukraine becoming a neutral state, dramatically reducing its military and abandoning its Nato aspirations - are unacceptable to Kyiv and to its Western partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the last week's round of talks, which lasted barely an hour, Peskov said a \"breakthrough\" in negotiations was \"hardly possible\". </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The gunmen then demanded a ransom of one million naira ($655; £485) per captive, media in Nigeria report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local government chairman Manniru Haidara Kaura said that most of those killed were young people who \"were slaughtered like rams\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What happened was that the bandits demanded ransom money, and after some back-and-forth, they were given what they asked for.

To the good people of Zamfara, remain united and vigilant.

It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested on those charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also made abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But families often feel forced to pay to save their loved ones, citing the government's inability to ensure their safety. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Israel, it said, was \"whitewashing its image before the world\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel later carried out an airstrike during the \"tactical pause.\" Reports from the scene say a mother called Wafaa Harara and her four children, Sara, Areej, Judy and Iyad were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Israel continues to insist it is not responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and does not impose restrictions on aid entering Gaza, those claims are not accepted by its close allies in Europe, or the United Nations and other agencies active in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The new measures might be a tacit admission by the Israelis that they need to do more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More likely they are a gesture to allies who have issued strong statements blaming Israel for starvation in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest, on Friday 25 July, from Britain, France and Germany was stark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We call on the Israeli government to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and urgently allow the UN and humanitarian NGOs to carry out their work in order to take action against starvation. Israel must uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel followed a total blockade of all aid into Gaza with restrictions on the approval of the contents and movement of aid convoys. With the Americans, it has set up a new system of distributing aid through the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), intended to replace the aid network run by the United Nations. Israel claims that Hamas stole aid from the UN system. The UN says it is still waiting for the Israelis to back their claims with evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN and other agencies will not cooperate with the GHF system, which they say is inhumane and militarised. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been shot dead looking for food since the GHF operation, according to the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A retired US special forces colonel who worked for the GHF in Gaza told the BBC that he saw American colleagues and IDF soldiers opening fire on civilians. Both deny they have targeted civilians.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: Air drop aid seen arriving in northern Gaza</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jonathan Whittall, the head in the Occupied Palestinian Territories of the UN's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has already condemned the methods used by the GHF. Israel told him his visa would not be renewed after he posted on social media a month ago that the GHF system had brought to Gaza \"conditions created to kill… what we are seeing is carnage. It is weaponised hunger. It is forced displacement. It's a death sentence for people just trying to survive. It appears to be the erasure of Palestinian life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After Israel announced its new measures, Whittall told the BBC that \"the humanitarian situation in Gaza has never been worse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said for Israel's new measures to change matters for the better it would have to reduce the time it takes to allow trucks to transit the crossings into Gaza and improve the routes provided by the IDF for the convoys to use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel would also need to provide \"meaningful assurances that the people gathering to take food off the back of the trucks won't be shot by Israeli forces\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whittall has been going in and out of Gaza since the war started, though that is now ending unless Israel decides not to withdraw his visa after all. He says that as IDF military operations continue \"there remains an abhorrent disregard for humanitarian law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant are already the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year, accused of joint criminal responsibility for \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\" Netanyahu, Gallant and the Israeli state deny the allegations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel released grainy footage of a transport plane dropping pallets of aid into Gaza. Lines of parachutes billowed out the back of the aircraft in the dark of the night. The IDF said it had delivered seven packages of aid containing flour, sugar and tinned food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other wars I have seen aid being dropped, both from the aircraft themselves and close up on the ground as it lands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Air dropping aid is an act of desperation. It can also look good on television, and spread a feel-good factor that something, at last, is being done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a crude process, that will not on its own do much to end hunger in Gaza. Only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long term aid operation can do that.

I flew with them and watched British and American airmen dropping aid from the rear cargo ramps of the planes several thousand feet above the people who needed it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was welcome enough. But when a few days later when I managed to reach the improvised camps in the mountains, I saw young men running into minefields to get aid that landed there. Some were killed and maimed in explosions. I saw families killed when heavy pallets dropped on their tents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Mostar was besieged during the war in Bosnia in 1993, I saw pallets of American military \"meals ready to eat\", dropped from high altitude, scattered all over the east side of the city that was being constantly shelled. Some aid pallets crashed through roofs that had somehow not been destroyed by artillery attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professionals involved in relief operations regard dropping aid from the sky as a last resort. They use it when any other access is impossible. That's not the case in Gaza. A short drive north is Ashdod, Israel's modern container port. A few more hours away is the Jordanian border, which has been used regularly as a supply line for aid for Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gaza was one of the world's most densely populated places before the war when the population of more than two million Palestinians had access to the entire strip. In British terms, the Gaza Strip is slightly smaller than the Isle of Wight. Compared to American cities, it's roughly the size of Philadelphia or Detroit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now Israel has forced most of Gaza's people into a tiny area on the southern coast, amounting to around 17% of Gaza's land. Most of them live in densely packed tents. It is not clear if there is even an open space for despatchers high in the sky to aim at.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pallets of aid dropped by parachute often land far from the people who need it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each pallet will be fought over by desperate men trying to get food for their families, and by criminal elements who will want to sell it for profit.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But they were denied permission to unload the smoking, leaking container at ports in Qatar and India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The container had been leaking acid at a rate of about a litre an hour for at least eight days when it sailed into Sri Lankan waters late at night on 19 May 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It had requested emergency berthing - but by the morning the Singapore-flagged vessel was alight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite firefighting efforts from the crew, the Sri Lankan authorities and salvors, the fire spread throughout the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two weeks later, it sank, spilling its cargo and fuel into the sea around nine nautical miles off the country's south-west coast, between the capital Colombo and Negombo to the north.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Muditha Katuwawala shows tiny nurdles collected from a beach in Sri Lanka</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What happened next \"was just like out of a war movie\", says Muditha Katuwawala, an environmentalist and founder of the Pearl Protectors, a local NGO that volunteered to help the clean-up operation, which was run largely by Sri Lankan state authorities with funding from the ship's owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We started seeing turtles getting washed up with similar sorts of traits... the skin had burn marks [and] was peeling off. The nose and eyes were red and puffed up, and we saw dolphins washing up and... their skin was peeling off and red,\" Mr Katuwawala said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The nurdles on the beaches were \"like snow,\" he says, adding that \"it was horrifying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The clean-up began in earnest. At the start, Mr Katuwawala and his fellow volunteers \"were collecting like 300-400 kilos of nurdles\" each day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over time, it dropped to three to four kilograms in a couple of hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The nurdles were getting more dispersed, it was harder to see them as they got buried in the sand over time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was decided the cost-benefit ratio was no longer worth the effort of mobilising volunteers. The groups stood down, leaving the task to state-organised local clean-up groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, scientists were getting concerned about the possibility the plastic pellets - already harmful to animals which eat them accidentally - may be getting more toxic, contaminated from the spill, or from other pollution sources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the ensuing years, they have collected samples which could help trace the effect over time. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The most heavily contaminated nurdles are those burnt in the fire, forensic chemists say</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In November 2024, the BBC and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://watershedinvestigations.com/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Watershed Investigations</a> sent more than 20 of those samples to a team of forensic chemists specialising in environmental pollution from Manchester Metropolitan University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They found the most heavily contaminated nurdles were those burnt in the fire, which leach metals toxic to aquatic life, like arsenic, lead, cadmium, copper, cobalt and nickel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The team also found the pellets \"still going round appear to be sucking up more pollution from the environment\" and were becoming \"more toxic\", according to Mr Megson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They will be ingested [and] will pass pollution on to marine organisms,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tests carried out on fish caught near the site of the disaster - as well as the nearby Negombo lagoon - found some contained the same pollutants that were present in the ship's cargo and on the nurdles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the fish contained levels of hazardous metals  - some of which were found in the disaster - which exceeded safe limits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Researchers say the disaster cannot be discounted as the source of contamination, although it also can't be directly proven to be the source, as it's not known if these fish ate nurdles, how many they ingested, or if the pollution came from other sources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But placed on top of everything else that is in that system, there's a really good likelihood that it's causing harm to the environment and also potentially harm to people and humans that are eating and relying on that marine ecosystem for a source of their food,\" Mr Megson adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local fishermen do draw the link to the disaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's no fish since then. We've never had the same amount of fish that we used to catch,\" fisherman Jude Sulanta explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our lives have turned upside down. From the stretch where the ship sank up until here you don't get many new, young fish at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship's owner, X-Press Feeders Ltd, says to date it has worked diligently to ensure the best response to the disaster and spent more than $130m (£96m) to remove the wreck and debris at sea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says it has also paid more than $20m to the Sri Lankan government for clean-up operations on the coast and to compensate fishermen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says, however, that the Sri Lankan government has assumed responsibility for all shoreside clean-up activities and it is disappointed by the delays in that process and the ongoing impacts this is having.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Sri Lankan government says the amount paid by the ship's owner - which was capped by an interim UK maritime court order - is not enough to cover the long-term damage, and it is pursuing legal action to overturn the cap and secure further compensation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Thursday, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court ordered the company to pay $1bn as an initial payment to cover long-term economic and environmental damage it says the country suffered as a result of the disaster - but the cap remains in place. The Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction over Singapore, where X-Press Feeders Ltd has its headquarters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">X-Press Feeders said it was extremely disappointed with the judgment and that they are reviewing it with their legal advisers, insurers and other relevant stakeholders to best assess their next course of action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professor Prasanthi Gunawardena - an environmental economist at University of Sri Jayawardenapura who chaired an expert committee of scientists to assess the damage - puts the cost of the disaster at closer to more than $6bn, taking into account things like the loss of wildlife, as well as impact on tourism, fishing and harm to local residents from the toxic cloud released when the ship burned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Large quantities of dioxin and furan have been added to the atmosphere and these are carcinogens. And then we have calculated it may kill about 70 people in our country,\" says Prof Gunawardena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship owner rejects this assessment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It quotes the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF), an organisation which is funded by the shipping industry to assess marine spills. It says the report was \"unparticularised, inaccurate, and lacked credible scientific basis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship owner has also said itself and its crew have \"followed the internationally accepted procedures in dealing with the acid leak, while maintaining all safety and emergency protocols\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Colombo Port Authority has also denied any responsibility, saying it did not know of the issues until the ship arrived in its waters.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Jude Sulanta says many local fishermen are now selling their boats and trying to go abroad</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sea is the lifeblood of this island nation. Its stunning golden coasts are a huge draw for tourists, and for generations fishing has fed the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr Sulanta, the fisherman, is worried that his way of life no longer has a future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Many are selling their boats and trying to go abroad.

He wants to get the glory to boost his own political standing, and to secure minerals that are in America's interests,\" Prof De Waal said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, he noted that \"in DR Congo, China has already snapped up many of the minerals so the US is playing catch-up\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said that up to now US companies had been cautious about investing in DR Congo because of safety concerns and the \"moral hazard\" of dealing in so-called \"blood minerals\" - minerals financing rebellions - but this could change as the Trump administration implemented its peace model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof De Waal said this could also happen in other conflict-hit states like Sudan, where the Trump administration - along with Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - was expected to get involved in mediation efforts after previous initiatives failed.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that the Trump administration's peace model could not be dismissed out of hand, especially if it stops fighting that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions of others in conflicts that have raged for more than 30 years in eastern DR Congo. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump can get the different sides to talk, and shake things up,\" Prof De Waal said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Prof Hanri Mostert, an academic on mineral law at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, told the BBC that DR Congo \"risked compromising sovereignty over its minerals\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo could find itself locked into deals for years, in exchange for vague guarantees of security, she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was reminiscent of the \"resource-bartering\" deals pursued by China and Russia in numerous African states, Prof Mostert added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She cited as an example Angola, where China built infrastructure in exchange for oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Even when oil prices went up, Angola couldn't get more value for it,\" Prof Mostert said. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Three Chinese railway workers, two of whom are sitting and one of whom is walking, prepare to put tracks on 31 March2007 in Dondo in Angola\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">China has improved the rail network in Angola in exchange for access to the country's oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US State Department said in 2023 that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">DR Congo had an estimated $25trn (£21.2trn) in mineral reserves</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This included cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese and tantalum - needed to make the electronic components used in computers, electric vehicles, mobile phones, wind turbines and military hardware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For how long will DR Congo have to give its cobalt to US investors? Will it be 20 years or 50 years? What is the price for peace?\" Prof Mostert asked. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo government spokesman Patrick Muyaya confirmed to the BBC's Newsday programme in March that his country wanted to supply the US with \"some critical minerals\" in exchange for a security deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The M23 rebel group launched a major offensive early this year, seizing huge areas of eastern DR Congo and smuggling minerals across the border to Rwanda,  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/s/2025/446\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">UN experts said in a report earlier this month</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minerals were then mixed with Rwandan production, and \"their subsequent export to downstream actors reached unprecedented levels\", the UN experts added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rwanda denies accusations that it backs the M23, even though the UN has provided evidence it has thousands of soldiers in DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In what appears to be an attempt to address the issue of mineral smuggling, the US-brokered peace deal between DR Congo and Rwanda provides for a still-to-be negotiated \"regional economic integration framework\" between the two rival states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This would \"ensure illicit economic pathways are blocked\" and \"mutually beneficial partnerships and investment opportunities\" created for \"greater prosperity - especially for the region's population\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We're getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it,\" Trump said, ahead of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.state.gov/peace-agreement-between-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-and-the-republic-of-rwanda/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">peace deal signed by representatives of the two governments on 27 June in Washington</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A DR Congo researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Bram Verelst, told the BBC that the US initiative was running in tandem with another one being led by Qatar, a close US ally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Verelst said the US's focus was mainly on the regional dimension, while Qatar's was on domestic issues between DR Congo's government and the M23 rebel group that has set up its own administration in the east after capturing the regional capital, Goma. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The BBC's Paul Njie reports from inside rebel-held Goma</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist who specialises in the region, told the BBC that Qatar, like other oil-rich Gulf states, was expanding into Africa \"to project power, influence, but also to seek economic opportunities\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that it became involved in mediation efforts at the request of Rwanda, which perceived the US as being in favour of DR Congo, something Washington denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Stearns said Qatar had \"massive\" economic interests in Rwanda, pointing out that the Gulf state was building a new multi-billion dollar airport in Kigali and was in talks to acquire a 49% stake in the national airline. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explained that the US and Qatar were working closely together, but it was less than ideal to have two processes because \"you don't want to end up in a situation where there is a peace deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, but Rwanda then says: 'We don't control the M23', and the M23 continues escalating [the conflict] in eastern DR Congo\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So it's very important that the two processes are tightly tied to each other since the actors are so closely linked,\" Prof Stearns added.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the peace deal, DR Congo and Rwanda agreed to launch a \"security co-ordination mechanism\" within 30 days of the 27 June deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Verelst said that a ceasefire was expected to take effect on Tuesday, followed by the DR Congo government and the M23 signing a comprehensive peace agreement by 18 August, building on the \"declaration of principles\" they had already negotiated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo-based International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank analyst Onesphore Sematumba said the US and Qatar were getting deals struck in \"record time\" since Trump's rise to the US presidency in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Sematumba said their intervention came after various Africa-led mediation efforts had \"failed to get the parties to sign even a single document\" since 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Regional players do not have the same leverage to influence Kigali and Kinshasa,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But between the signing of an agreement and the achievement of peace, the road can be long, and it will be long in this case,\" Mr Sematumba warned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One key question is whether the M23 will give up the territory under its control, as demanded by Tshisekedi's government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Sematumba said the M23 had agreed to \"state authority\" being established across DR Congo, however, the rebels have also said they would not give up a \"single centimetre\" of land.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Personally, I think the transition should be gradual, and for certain areas there should be some kind of co-management. But everything will depend on the tact of the mediators, and their ability to break the ice,\" Mr Sematumba added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the success of the peace initiative also hinged on what the agreement called the \"lifting of defensive measures\" by Rwanda, widely interpreted to mean the withdrawal of its troops from eastern DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Rwanda denies backing the M23, it says it wants to wipe out the FDLR, a militia born from those who carried out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and then fled into DR Congo. Rwanda has accused the Congolese army of working with the FDLR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The peace deal spells out that the FDLR should be \"neutralised\", however this has been attempted several times over the past three decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For Rwanda, the neutralisation of the FDLR is a precondition for the withdrawal of its forces, while DR Congo says the two must be achieved simultaneously,\" Mr Sematumba pointed out, saying that mediators would have to find a solution as these issues had led to the failure of previous peace initiatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Just by following the different interpretations given by the parties to the texts signed, you can sense all the difficulties that lie ahead,\" Mr Sematumba said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Mostert agreed that diplomacy on its own could not achieve peace, and a broader initiative was needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You build peace by transforming pain. That takes more than diplomacy. It takes dialogue, decentralised participation and dignifying people's experiences,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's why I believe it is important that the dealmakers and the lawmakers remain aware of historical traumas, including decades of resource exploitation,\" Prof Mostert added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So if he wants the peace to hold for long enough for US companies to profit, Donald Trump may have to keep the pressure on for some time to come.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 gMiqnK bPmazG\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 jdmgui\">More BBC stories on DR Congo-Rwanda peace deal:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Many are now displayed in a nearby museum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ajay Kumar, leading the state archaeology team at Keeladi, says the key finds are elaborate brick structures and water systems - evidence of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This was a literate, urban society where people had separate spaces for habitation, burial practices and industrial work,\" Mr Kumar says, noting it's the first large, well-defined ancient urban settlement found in southern India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since the Indus Valley Civilisation's discovery in the early 1900s, most efforts to trace civilisation's origins in the subcontinent have focused on northern and central India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, the Keeladi finds have sparked excitement across Tamil Nadu and beyond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">William Daniel, a teacher from neighbouring Kerala, said the discoveries made him feel proud about his heritage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It gives people from the south [of India] something to feel proud about, that our civilisation is just as ancient and important as the one in the north [of India],\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Red and black pottery excavated from the site, displayed at the Keeladi Museum</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The politics surrounding Keeladi reflects a deep-rooted north-south divide - underscoring how understanding the present requires grappling with the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's first major civilisation - the Indus Valley - emerged in the north and central regions between 3300 and 1300 BCE. After its decline, a second urban phase, the Vedic period, rose in the Gangetic plains, lasting until the 6th Century BCE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This phase saw major cities, powerful kingdoms and the rise of Vedic culture - a foundation for Hinduism. As a result, urbanisation in ancient India is often viewed as a northern phenomenon, with a dominant narrative that the northern Aryans \"civilised\" the Dravidian south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This is especially evident in the mainstream understanding of the spread of literacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is believed that the Ashokan Brahmi script - found on Mauryan king Ashoka's rock edicts in northern and central India, dating back to the 3rd Century BCE - is the predecessor of most scripts in South and Southeast Asia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Epigraphists like Iravatham Mahadevan and Y Subbarayalu have long held the view that the Tamil Brahmi script - the Tamil language spoken in Tamil Nadu and written in the Brahmi script -  was an offshoot of the Ashokan Brahmi script.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now, archaeologists from the Tamil Nadu state department say that the excavations at Keeladi are challenging this narrative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have found graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 6th Century BCE, which shows that it is older than the Ashokan Brahmi script. We believe that both scripts developed independently and, perhaps, emerged from the Indus Valley script,\" Mr Kumar says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a81e/live/40b3b290-6792-11f0-bb36-0d40aadb5bb7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Keeladi Museum Graffitti found on a potsherd, placed on display at the Keeladi Museum in Tamil Nadu, India\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Keeladi Museum</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Archaeologists say some graffiti found in Keeladi resembles that of the Indus Valley</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Epigraphist S Rajavelu, former professor of marine archaeology at the Tamil University, agrees with Mr Kumar and says other excavation sites in the state too have unearthed graffiti in the Tamil Brahmi script dating back to the 5th and 4th Century BCE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But some experts say that more research and evidence are needed to conclusively prove the antiquity of the Tamil Brahmi script.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another claim by the state department of archaeology that has ruffled feathers is that the graffiti found on artefacts in Keeladi is similar to that found in the Indus Valley sites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People from the Indus Valley may have migrated to the south, leading to a period of urbanisation taking place in Keeladi at the same time it was taking place in the Gangetic plains,\" Mr Kumar says, adding that further excavations are needed to fully grasp the settlement's scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Ajit Kumar, a professor of archaeology at Nalanda University in Bihar, says that this wouldn't have been possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Considering the rudimentary state of travel back then, people from the Indus Valley would not have been able to migrate to the south in such large numbers to set up civilisation,\" he says.

For most it's an insurance policy against whatever they're concerned about. Having a second citizenship is a good back-up plan,\" he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Volek says the ease-of-travel advantages the Caribbean passports provide appeals to businesspeople, and may also present a security benefit. \"Some US clients prefer to travel on a more politically-benign passport.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prior to the Covid pandemic, the US was not even on Henley's \"radar\", Mr Volek continues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Movement restrictions proved \"quite a shock\" for affluent people used to travelling freely on private jets, prompting the first surge in stateside CBI applications. Interest ratcheted up again after the 2020 and 2024 US elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There are Democrats that don't like Trump but also Republicans that don't like Democrats,\" Mr Volek says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In the last two years we've gone from having zero offices in the US to eight across all major cities, with another two to three opening in the coming months.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Robert Taylor, from Halifax in Canada, bought a property in Antigua where he plans to retire later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He invested $200,000 just before the real estate threshold was raised to $300,000 last summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only does being a citizen avoid restrictions on length of stay, it also gives him the freedom to take advantage of business opportunities, he explains. \"I chose Antigua because it has beautiful water, I find the people very, very friendly and it also means great weather for the later part of my life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Still, such programmes are not without controversy. When passport sales were first mooted in 2012 by the then Antiguan government as a way of propping up the ailing economy, some considered the ethics a little iffy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Protesters took to the streets in condemnation, recalls former Speaker of the House Gisele Isaac. \"There was a sense of nationalism; people felt we were selling our identity, so to speak, to people who knew nothing about us,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Leaders of some other Caribbean nations that do not offer CBIs have also been quick to criticise, including St Vincent and the Grenadines' Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.

Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne said money raised had brought his country back from the brink of bankruptcy over the past decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Aside from buying property, other routes to Caribbean citizenship through investment typically include a one-off donation to a national development fund or similar. They range from $200,000 in Dominica for a single applicant, to $250,000 for a main applicant and up to three qualifying dependents in Dominica and St Kitts. In Antigua, investors also have the option of donating $260,000 to the University of the West Indies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the face of international pressure, the islands have committed to new measures to bolster oversight, including establishing a regional regulator to set standards, monitor operations and ensure compliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Additionally, six principles agreed with the US include enhanced due diligence, regular audits, mandatory interviews with all applicants, and the removal of a loophole that previously enabled an applicant denied by one country to apply in another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These days, passport sales account for 10-30% of the islands' GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Andre Huie, a journalist in St Kitts, says his country's CBI scheme is \"generally well supported\" as a result. \"The public understand the value of it to the economy, and appreciate what the government has been able to do with the money.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It is known for its crystalline bell-like tone and has been Kashmir's musical signature for centuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ghulam Mohammed belongs to a lineage of craftsmen who have been building string instruments in Kashmir for over seven generations. The Zaz family name has long been synonymous as the makers of the santoor, rabab, sarangi and sehtar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in recent years, the demand for handcrafted instruments has dwindled, replaced by machine-made versions that are cheaper and quicker to produce. At the same time, music tastes have changed, adding to the decline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"With hip hop, rap, and electronic music now dominating Kashmir's soundscape, younger generations no longer connect with the depth or discipline of traditional music,\" says Shabir Ahmad Mir, a music teacher. As a result, demand for the santoor has collapsed, leaving craftsmen without apprentices or a sustainable market, he adds. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4537/live/5cf92080-2411-11f0-9060-674316cb3a1f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Adil Amin Akhoon A photo album with a picture showing Ghulam Mohammed receiving the Padma Shri. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Adil Amin Akhoon</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Mr Ghulam Mohammed received India's fourth highest civil honour in 2022</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his century-old shop, Mr Ghulam Mohammed sits beside a hollow block of wood and worn iron tools - the quiet remnants of a fading tradition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no one left [to continue the craft],\" he says. \"I am the last.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it wasn't always this way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, renowned Sufi and folk artists have played santoors handcrafted by Mr Ghulam Mohammed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A photo in his shop shows maestros Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma and Bhajan Sopori performing with his instruments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Believed to have originated in Persia, the santoor reached India in the 13th or 14th century, spreading through Central Asia and the Middle East.

Growing up, he was surrounded by the sounds and tools of his family's trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Health issues forced him to leave formal education at an early age and that is when he began learning the art of santoor-making from his father and grandfather - both master craftsmen themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They taught me not just how to make an instrument but how to listen - to the wood, the air and the hands that would play it,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My ancestors used to be summoned by the courts of local kings and were often asked to build instruments that could soothe hearts,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his workshop, a wooden bench lined with chisels and strings lies beside the skeletal frame of an unfinished santoor. The air smells faintly of aged walnut wood, but there is no machinery in sight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ghulam Mohammed believes machine-made instruments lack the warmth and depth of those crafted by hand and the audio quality comes nowhere close. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Making a santoor is a slow, deliberate process, the craftsman says. It starts with selecting the right wood, aged and seasoned for at least five years. The body is then carved and hollowed for optimal resonance, and each of the 25 bridges is precisely shaped and placed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over 100 strings are added, followed by the painstaking tuning process, which can take weeks or even months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is the craft of patience and perseverance,\" he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4b9a/live/0077e7d0-6271-11f0-b986-3166a974b17d.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Traditional sufi musicians of Kashmir, play santoor and other musical instruments on the stage, on March 23, 2019 in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian administered Kashmir, India. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The santoor has been Kashmir's musical signature for decades</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent years, social media influencers have visited Mr Ghulam Mohammed's workshop, sharing its story online.

Over the years, he's had offers - government grants, promises of apprentices, even suggestions from the state handicrafts department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr Ghulam Mohammed says he's \"not looking for fame or charity\". What he truly wants is someone to carry the art forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now in his eighties, he often spends hours beside an unfinished santoor, listening to the silence of what's yet to be completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is not just woodwork,\" he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is poetry. A language. A tongue I give to the instrument.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I hear the santoor before it plays. That is the secret. That is what must be passed on,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the world outside embraces modernity, Mr Ghulam Mohammed's workshop remains untouched by time - slow, silent and filled with the scent of walnut and memory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Wood and music,\" he says, \"both die if you don't give them time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I want someone who truly loves the craft to take it forward.

Others urge tea drinkers to be careful about how much they use, and to savour matcha in its purest form rather than as an ingredient in recipes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's \"a bit sad\" to see high-grade matcha used in cooking - where its delicate flavour is often lost - or stockpiled for resale, said Ms Mori.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Matcha is the highest grade of tea and it's so special to us. So there's a bit of a contradiction when I hear stories about how it's resold or used in food.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dee/live/0978b490-66b3-11f0-bc39-7f9330c24093.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Courtesy of Camellia Tea Ceremony A photo of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony.

The president and his White House chief of staff were playing golf at Trump's Bedminster club in 2019, and Mulvaney was up by one stroke with three holes left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I slapped him on the shoulder and joked with him, 'I got you today, old man,'\" Mulvaney told the BBC. \"He looked at me, half smiled, half-sneered and just laughed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president birdied two of the next three holes and beat Mulvaney by two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mulvaney, who worked in Trump's White House for three years in his first term, says he played golf with, or in the group just behind, the president around 40 times and never beat the man 21 years his elder.  \"Just soul-crushing\" is how he described it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Golf has been a popular activity for many modern American presidents, but none has had quite the same relationship with the sport as Trump, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8g8w431wyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">who is in Scotland this weekend </a>for the opening of a new Trump course near Balmedie in Aberdeenshire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For presidents like Barack Obama and George W Bush, golf seemed to serve as a diversion from the burdens of office.

He said the future president's passion was clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He's nuts about golf,\" he said. \"He knew the background and history of the game. It was impressive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump, a real-estate developer turned politician, has played golf since his college days and bought his first golf property, Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach Florida, in 1999. Trump Golf currently owns 11 courses in the US and three in the UK, manages several others and has plans for new resorts in Oman, Indonesia, Vietnam and Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Golf clubs are a prized possession for Trump – and not always a profit-making one. According to filings with the British government, Trump's Balmedie course lost $1.83m (£1.35m) in 2023 – its 11th-straight year running a deficit. Turnberry, on the other hand, reported about $5m in profit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has at times clashed with local authorities over land use and sought to restrict construction of wind turbines off the coast of his Balmedie property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While his US courses have hosted major professional tournaments, he has long wanted Turnberry, which he will visit this weekend, to be the site of a future British Open Championship. The historic course has hosted four of the prestigious competitions, but none since Trump purchased the property in 2014.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac89/live/583b5da0-68aa-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PA Trump and Murdoch are in a crowd of people on the International Golf Links course.

When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the Oval Office in May, he gave the president an illustrated South African golf book and included golf professionals Ernie Els and Retief Goosen in his national delegation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That didn't help much, however, as the meeting devolved into <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">an extended confrontation over South African land confiscation policies</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump poses for a photo with Alexander Stubb\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Trump partnered with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in a tournament earlier this year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While that drama played out in front of the gathered press and live television cameras, Trump may see benefit from his more cloistered golf outings, as it gives him an opportunity for meetings well removed from the prying eyes of journalists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reporters accompany Trump on all of his public movements, but when the president is on the golf course they are kept well away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has time out of the eye of anybody else to deal with people,\" Johnston said. \"And of course, those heads of corporations or states, similarly, are going to use the opportunity to be away from any spotlight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president's penchant for privacy on the links also means there are wildly conflicting accounts of how good a golfer Trump really is. He boasts of winning dozens of club championships - all on courses he owns - including five this year alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sports journalist Rick Reilly, in his 2019 book Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, writes that Trump's championship claims are so \"over-the-top\" that he loses all credibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He details what he says is Trump's penchant for cheating, including moving his ball to better spots on the course and taking multiple mulligans – a custom in which a player is allowed to replay a stroke with no penalty, after a mishit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He's a notorious cheat,\" Johnston said. \"I spoke to someone once who played a round of golf with him, who told me that he had taken six mulligans on a single hole.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Mulvaney, who says he never saw Trump cheat, the president may use golf as a way to connect, but 18 holes with the president isn't about business or government or politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is golf,\" he said. \"And while that sounds obtuse, golfers know what I mean. Trump was a golfing enthusiast long before he was president. And he will be long after, as well.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
