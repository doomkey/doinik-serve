I have been informed that this has not been the case either,\" she said in a statement on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, Aaja Chenmitz, said: \"Nato in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said she hoped this meant that there would be \"the direct discussions that Denmark had asked for, for Denmark, Greenland and the United States on the way forward around Greenland, protecting Greenland's sovereignty\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is there any detail about the possible deal?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Danish and Greenlandic reiteration that sovereignty is non-negotiable appears to be aimed at rejecting reports in the New York Times, where anonymous officials said one idea under discussion was for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Denmark to cede sovereignty over small areas of Greenland </a>where the US would build military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This arrangement would be similar to the status of two military bases in Cyprus,  which are controlled by the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/default/files/document/files/2024/05/cy600816treatynicosia.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Akrotiri and Dhekelia have been under UK sovereignty since Cyprus became independent </a>in 1960. That treaty has been modified since, but essentially it is considered British territory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yvette Cooper did not confirm whether she knew what the framework agreement contained, but mentioned \"some very practical discussions about Greenland's security, whilst being very, very clear that Greenland sovereignty is not up for negotiation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In arguing in favour of seizing Greenland, Trump has mentioned the threat of Chinese and Russian vessels around the island, even though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/denmarks-arctic-commander-rejects-claims-of-immediate-russia-china-threat-to-greenland/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Denmark says there is no threat \"today\"</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this point, Nato allies have tried to reassure the US that they will boost security in the Arctic and Mark Rutte told the Reuters news agency on Thursday that the framework deal would also require this contribution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the ideas the UK has been calling for is to set up an Arctic Sentry, said Yvette Cooper on Thursday, which was a \"very similar to the approach that Nato has taken to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gx74d06ywo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Baltic sentry</a>\" - a mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were severed. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will any deal short of 'ownership' please Trump?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has had a military presence in Greenland since after World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. So discussions to reach a deal may centre on a renegotiation of that agreement, according to US officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US does have military bases in many countries - including Germany - but they do not constitute sovereign territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has insisted a lease agreement over Greenland is not good enough. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" he said two weeks ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In order to acquire the island, he has threatened to use force - until a U-turn in Davos where he dropped that threat to the relief of his Nato allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato was founded in 1949 on the principle that an attack on one ally is an attack on all. These attacks were meant to come from outside, and Denmark had made it clear a military attack would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, where the US is the major partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nato secretary-general has been criticised for the praise he has constantly showered on President Trump - at one point calling him \"daddy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can always take Donald Trump at his word. That is why I really think we are very glad to have him,\" Rutte said on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Danish prime minister said she had been in constant contact with Rutte before and after Trump's announcement. But it is not clear what - if any - Danish input led to the latest climbdown by Trump. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why does Trump want Greenland?</h2></p><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has sought to buy Greenland off Denmark since his first time in office - and he is not the only US president to try to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump says the US needs Greenland to protect against possible attacks from Russia and China. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also said Greenland is essential for his plan to build a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyvmj6mem70o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Golden Dome defence system</a>, designed to protect the US against missile attacks, and that European allies could co-operate in this endeavour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with Greenland's strategic location, the US has spoken about the island's vast - and largely untapped - reserves of rare earth minerals, many of which are crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has not said the US is after Greenland's riches, but that a US control over the island \"puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a deal that's forever.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ros Atkins on...

They provided no other details except that the group includes \"at least one young girl\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The landslides were triggered by heavy rains over the last few days, which led to flooding and power outages across the North Island.

signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As talks to end the war in Ukraine continue, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky are due to meet in Davos on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump repeated his often-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.</p></div><p

Thousands of apartment blocks remain without heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been concern in Kyiv that Trump's spat with his European Nato allies over the future of Greenland has deflected him from the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said after talks with Trump in Miami late last month that a 20-point US plan to end the war was 90% ready and that Ukraine's position on Donbas, in eastern Ukraine, was different to Russia's.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Specifically, Zelensky has offered to withdraw troops from the 25% of Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls by up to 40km (25 miles), to create an economic zone, if Russia does the same. Russian forces have advanced slowly in the east in the past year and Putin is known to covet control of the entire region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other big sticking point that Zelensky highlighted last month was future control of Ukraine's enormous Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, seized by Russia in March 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that discussion with the American envoys would continue \"on the Ukrainian issue and other related topics\" and refused to say whether he shared Witkoff's optimism on achieving a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has also not yet decided whether to join Trump's Board of Peace on Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's president had hoped to sign two key documents with Trump at Davos covering future security guarantees as well as economic prosperity, but said there was \"one mile left to finalise these documents\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not yet clear if any signings will take place during their meeting at the World Economic Forum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the head of Ukraine's national security and defence council, Rustem Umerov, said on Wednesday night that his team in Davos had discussed the issues of economic development, post-war recovery and security guarantees with their US counterparts.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It is due to begin operating commercially next month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"an-earlier-version-of-this-story-said-the-kashiwazaki-kariwa-nuclear-plant-was-in-tokyo-and-has-been-corrected-to-say-it-is-north-west-of-tokyo.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">An earlier version of this story said the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was in Tokyo and has been corrected to say it is north-west of Tokyo.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\" following the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \"terrorism and conspiracy\". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his \"only hearing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This has nothing to do with justice,\" she said at the time. \"Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,\" she added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been \"forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was \"left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold \"until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move renewed the possibility that the EU might move forward with tariffs on a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods it announced last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It had put those plans on hold while the trade deal was being finalised but those levies would now come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves to extend the pause or approves the new deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lange, speaking before Trump announced the \"framework deal\" and backed off the tariff threat,  said there would be \"no possibility for compromise\" until Trump's threats ended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also raised the prospect of the use of the \"anti-coercion instrument\" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\", an idea also backed by French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC after Trump's announcement, Lange declined to say whether it could salvage the trade deal, adding that it would take \"some time\" to understand its implications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to look what this so-called solution would mean,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There seems to be a sense in Brussels that Trump's climbdown was inevitable. When BBC News asked one well placed EU source for a response to President Trump saying he wouldn't go ahead with the tariffs, the response was simply an eye-rolling emoji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the last year, financial markets have batted away concerns over the impact of the US president's policy announcements, taking comfort in the TACO acronym, Trump Always Chickens Out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the sense of him not following through on threats has also taken hold in some corridors of power.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He called for \"immediate negotiations\" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security, announcing the \"framework\" of a future deal a few hours later.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's speech helped to calm financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, which had sunk in previous days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in the US gained further on the deal announcement, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising more than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the FTSE 100 closed slightly higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjnlm54po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal</a> amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said European leaders should not jump to retaliate, urging them to \"have an open mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I really don't think that we should be approaching this matter in a point-scoring way.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said South African police were doing their best to fight the violence \"but the problem is a growing one. That is my view\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His visit comes months after Nelson Mandela Bay was hit by a wave of killings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A deadly spike in violence hit the area in the latter half of last year, leaving 118 people dead between August and December, a local prevention group said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The violence has continued into the new year, with around 40 people killed across the region in January, local media reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79xyxdpzrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">11 people were killed in a mass shooting </a>linked to illegal mining turf wars near Johannesburg. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred just two weeks after another attack at the Saulsville Hostel in the capital Pretoria, where <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyvkrkl2jlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">11 people, including a three-year-old child, were killed.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another incident last May, gunmen killed eight customers at a tavern in the south-eastern city of Durban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised stronger law enforcement action and increased police deployment to tackle the gang violence in the country. </p></div></div></body></html>"

transactions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kampala is famous for its ubiquitous boda boda (motorcycle) taxis, with many operators earning their income through online ride-hailing apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The co-founder of SafeBoda told local media that the platform's entire server was down during the internet suspension, with many<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>riders forced off the road and other businesses that depend on the service deprived of their income.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Namukwaya Olivia, who sells traditional cultural clothing and depends heavily on Instagram, TikTok and WhatsApp to reach customers, says she did not make any deliveries during the period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She tells the BBC that many of her customers ask for pictures before deciding on what to buy.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Namukwaya

eZyhnA\">\"We could not send pictures, we could not receive orders, and we could not make deliveries,\" the businesswoman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that the effect of the shutdown was immediate, and made it difficult to cover basic costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We couldn't pay rent during that period,\" she says. \"Even now, things have not fully recovered because customers still struggle to access us online.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Journalist<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Ngabo Amon says his smartphone, a work tool for him, became largely useless. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options,\" Ngabo says.</p></div><p

difficult to cope. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone,\" he says. \"It was not a good situation.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was all I could do.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer,\" he points out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are \"fake\" and has cited \"ballot stuffing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, \"the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also notes that the shutdown \"created suspicion and mistrust\" in the election process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown \"almost gave me depression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you,\" she says. \"But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aaron Benitez says he could not study</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I could not connect with them at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp,\" the student says. \"We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise  its online location. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.</p></div><figure></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said it struck \"several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat\" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a \"terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached\" them, without mentioning a location. The Yellow Line demarcates territory in Gaza still under Israeli control under the ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 466 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began on 10 October, according to the health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups over the same period.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three photojournalists killed on Wednesday were reportedly working for the Egyptian Relief Committee in the Gaza Strip to film its camps for displaced people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the humanitarian organisation said the car that was struck was marked with its logo and that it was \"targeted during a humanitarian mission, resulting in the martyrdom of three individuals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas called the strike a \"dangerous escalation of the flagrant violations of the ceasefire agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate said it constituted a war crime and evidence of what it called \"a systematic Israeli policy aimed at silencing the Palestinian voice, obstructing the transmission of facts, and concealing crimes committed against civilians\", according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdul Raouf Shaat was regular contributor to French news agency AFP, which expressed \"immense sadness\" at his death and demanded a \"full and transparent investigation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) also said it was \"appalled\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Israel, which possesses advanced technology capable of identifying its targets, has an obligation under international law to protect journalists,\" regional director Sara Qudah said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CPJ has documented the killing of at least 206 journalists and media workers by Israeli fire in Gaza since the start of the war - the deadliest conflict for journalists ever documented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Wednesday, two journalists had been killed in Israeli strikes during the ceasefire, and a third had been killed by members of a Palestinian armed group, according to the US-based organisation's data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International news outlets, including the BBC, rely on local journalists in Gaza, as Israel does not allow them to send foreign journalists into the territory independently. Some journalists are taken into Gaza by the Israeli military under controlled access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,550 people have been killed, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe.

Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi.

Each is a negative hand stencil: the artist pressed a hand to the rock and sprayed red pigment around it, leaving the hand itself as bare stone outlined in colour. The rock surface is uneven and mottled green, cream and brown, with cracks and small cavities. Three stencils are clear, with long, unnaturally narrow fingers that taper to points, while the fourth, at the top right, is partly flaked away so only fragments of the palm and fingers remain. The overall effect is of glowing red halos of paint framing pale hands that seem to reach out from the ancient rock\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Ahdi Agus Oktaviana</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">More recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Sign up here.</a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A negotiated settlement, he said. No force required. But the US needed \"full title\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We want this land\" to build the \"greatest Golden Dome ever built\", he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm asking for a piece of ice... it's a very small ask.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was incredible to see this said out loud.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mixed reactions in the room</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reaction in the room ranged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California said the speech was \"TACO\" Tuesday, a reference to the \"Trump always chickens out\" catchphrase used to mock the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from leaders Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Only 28 of the victims had labels with clearly visible names in the photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Labels on more than 100 victims, who had their date of death recorded, showed that date as 9 January, one of the deadliest nights for protesters in Tehran so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's streets were set on fire during clashes with security forces, with protesters chanting slogans against the supreme leader and the Islamic Republic. It followed a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late shah. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaked photos provide a small snapshot of the thousands believed to have been killed at the hands of the Iranian state.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1977/live/6476d590-f6ad-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Iranians gather while blocking a street during a protest in Tehran, Iran on 9 January.

Sources claimed the true number of dead at the mortuary ran into the thousands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One source, who we are not naming for their safety, told us they weren't prepared for the level of devastation they encountered inside the mortuary complex, and said they saw victims ranging from as young as 12 or 13 to 60 and 70-year-olds. \"It was just too much,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid the chaos inside the mortuary, family members and friends were huddled together around a screen, we were told. They were trying to identify their loved ones while hundreds of images of the dead flicked across the screen. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Crowds of anti-government protesters in Tehran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The slideshow lasted for hours, they said, adding that many of the victims' injuries were so severe they could not be identified. One man's face was so swollen his eyes were barely visible. Another man still had a breathing tube in his mouth, suggesting he died after receiving medical treatment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some victims were so badly injured that their families asked to see the pictures again and to zoom in on their faces to make sure it was really them, we were told. At other times people recognised their loved ones instantly and were seen collapsing to the floor, screaming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many photos showed unzipped body bags with papers laid close to their faces, identifying them by name, ID number or date of death. In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cre28d2j2zxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">tracked the spread of anti-government protests</a> across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Passengers became scared and the carriage went silent, he said, \"and then we heard a crash\" and the train stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Luggage fell and the lights went out. Then they started to hear noises of pain and screams from the three carriages behind them that had derailed, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He and his girlfriend were uninjured, but people were in shock and crying, some experiencing panic attacks. A nurse beside him responded to a call for medical volunteers, and when she came back from the sixth carriage she told him someone had died. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Surviving passengers from the derailed carriages broke glass and went on the tracks to escape.

The transport minister, Óscar Puente, described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska was quick to rule out sabotage but said  all other hypotheses were being considered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of Renfe \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error. Álvaro Fernández Heredia said even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it and both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators have been focusing on a 30cm gap in the straight section of track that the Iryo train passed over and the transport secretary has said they are assessing if that broken section was the \"cause or the result\" of the crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Óscar Puente has confirmed reports that grooves the size of a coin were found on the wheels of the first five carriages of the Iryo train that went over the track safely before the next three carriages derailed. Two or three trains that had gone over the track shortly beforehand had similar notches, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have suggested that a welding failure on the track may have led to it breaking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a transcript has been published by daily El País of calls to the control centre in Madrid from the Iryo driver and from the conductor on the Renfe train.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iryo driver is initially unaware his train has been involved in a severe crash.

But now, a growing number are siding with Democrats in Congress and Nato allies who say a takeover of Greenland would violate US and international law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, some Republican leaders have said there's little interest in the US buying Greenland or seizing it through military force. The White House had previously left the military option on the table but on Wednesday it was ruled out by Trump in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican lawmakers have also joined Democrats in opposing a new plan by Trump to place tariffs on countries that don't back his bid to acquire the territory, which is self-governed but controlled by Denmark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The proposed tariffs would be \"bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies,\" Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote on social media, adding that the move would benefit China and Russia. \"It's great for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Republicans said Trump's ambition to annex Greenland was threatening to undermine the Nato alliance - to which both the US and Denmark belong - in a moment of growing tension between the US and European allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued the US must own the territory to better compete with China and Russia in the Arctic, and has vowed to take it \"one way or another\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the US president downplayed concerns that the issue was hurting Nato when asked by the BBC if he was willing to see the decades-old security alliance collapse as a consequence of his push for the territory. Trump reiterated his view that ownership of Greenland was critical for US and global security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need [Greenland] for national security and even world security,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC asks if breakup of Nato is price Trump willing to pay for Greenland</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump's insistence on obtaining the territory is increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill, as more Republicans have come forward to break ranks publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, a Trump critic, said Trump's push for Greenland could lead to an impeachment investigation. And the Republican leaders in each chamber of Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, said they opposed a military intervention in Greenland, when Trump was refusing to rule that out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Republicans have voiced support for Trump. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Sunday that it was \"overwhelmingly in America's national interest\" to own Greenland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it comes to Greenland, I want to commend President Trump, for being single-mindedly focused on America First, on US economic interests, and US national security interests,\" Cruz said in a Fox News interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress has some options to try to rein Trump in, if Republicans and Democrats do choose to pick a fight with the president over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress has the power of the purse and in theory would have to approve funding used to buy Greenland, experts said. Denmark and Greenland have both insisted the island isn't for sale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If Trump wants to buy Greenland it would require an act of Congress to provide the funds to do so,\" said Daniel Schuman, the executive director of the American Governance Institute and an expert on congressional procedure. It's unlikely that Congress could repurpose existing funding to buy the territory, Schuman added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the administration has expanded the use of executive power to enact Trump's immigration and tariff agenda, among other issues. The administration might try to claim some new authority to seize Greenland that would allow it to overrule any roadblocks by Congress, Schuman said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawmakers worried about a military incursion in Greenland have signalled support for measures prohibiting any US action without congressional approval. But it's unclear if the proposals have enough Republican support to pass in either chamber of Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five Senate Republicans joined Democrats earlier this month to advance a bill that would have blocked the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela, following the attack in December that deposed former President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuela war powers resolution ultimately failed to get through the Senate. But it signalled mounting frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers with Trump's use of military force abroad, after he ran in 2024 on a promise to reduce US involvement in foreign conflicts. Last week a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Denmark in a symbolic show of support for Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also unclear how the Senate, which ratifies treaties, would respond if the US reached some sort of agreement with Denmark to take over part or all of Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has an existing arrangement with Denmark established in 1951 that allows the US to expand its military presence in Greenland. Murkowski and other Republicans have argued that the US doesn't need to take over the territory to address national security needs in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senate could try to thwart Trump by opposing a treaty between the US and Denmark, in the event the two nations reach an agreement. Treaties require two-thirds support in the Senate for ratification, which Republicans currently fall well short of.  </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Senator Lisa Murkowski, flanked by other members of the US Congress, speaks at a press conference in Copenhagen\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Last week, a US bipartisan delegation which included Senator Lisa Murkowski (C) visited Denmark in a show of solidarity with the US ally</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republicans have already indicated that they'd consider breaking with Trump over Greenland.

But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on

commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded

his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of

We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of cheese and is mostly eaten with naan, a type of bread, and rice\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of paneer cheese</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff.

Loomer has denied being racist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Below the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time.

The city's residents would frequent it in droves, particularly ahead of festivals, weddings and other important occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What started the fire is still unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But witnesses say the speed at which it spread, a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Muhammed Amin's brother is still missing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rehan Faisal, who owned a bedsheet shop, said that he was able to escape because his shop was located near one of the exits - he broke down the door to get out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that although his staff had heard there was a fire in one part of the market, they had initially not worried because it was located some distance away from them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No-one knew it would spread so much,\" Faisal added, saying it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shoiab, 19, who worked at a decorations shop, said he first heard about the fire on a lower floor at around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shoiab was among the luckier ones.

Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA People gather to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the train collision that occurred on 18 January, in Punta Umbria, Huelva, Spain, on 20 January 2026.

Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result of Sunday's crash, and the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m78xl0gmpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver</a> near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The notice was followed soon by a demolition order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\"

when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The West Bank was split into three categories of territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

He promised the economy would be the primary thing, but I don't know that it's completely been that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In comparison from what I remember from the last Trump administration, I feel like I was doing a lot better then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We still have a lot of things that [the Trump administration] is working through, so we'll see. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Devynn De Velasco, 22, Nebraska</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This independent voter is worried about how Trump's focus on foreign policy will ultimately impact the US economy.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the first few months he'd reference the economy, but I can't tell you the last time I've seen reporters questioning Trump about the economy let alone he addresses it on his own. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My husband and I are honestly worried about an economic collapse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We've been saving a lot of money - thinking of buying a house - but we have that in the back of our mind that if there is some sort of problem, we do have a full safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Politics and the economy are very much linked, so what our president does impacts the economy. So the threats to Greenland and Denmark and these remarks about Nato has made me quite anxious. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Denise Demontagnac, 21, Maryland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This registered Democrat graduated from university last year, and she has not been able to find work since, despite a job market the president has touted.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One year post graduation, I have not been able to find a stable job which is extremely impacting my life and my family's life as well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not that I haven't applied for jobs. I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are \"marginally ahead\" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that. I do not think the policies have created enough growth so that it overshadows the cost increases that we're seeing at the same time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I hope that the Federal Reserve retains enough autonomy to manage independently.
