Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year, the US announced a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87l7xjp235o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">vast arms sale to Taiwan</a> worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdred61epg4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro</a>, carried out strikes against <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged drug boats</a> in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86vvjxe9z7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">acquire Greenland</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"not coming back\"</a> and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, about 100 clergy members were arrested at the Minneapolis airport while holding a protest calling on US airlines to refuse to transport detainees arrested by ICE.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the airports commission told the Minnesota Reformer that the arrests took place after the \"permitted activity went beyond agreed upon terms\" and was to done to protect the public safety and airport access. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota as part of \"Operation Metro Surge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The killing of 37-year-old Minneapolis woman <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Renee Good</a> earlier this month  flared tensions across the state and brought condemnation from local officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We want ICE out of Minnesota, and we want ICE out of every state, with their extreme overreach,\" said Bishop Dwayne Royster, whose organisation Faith in Action is supporting local partners in Minneapolis during the strike. \"We want Congress to stand up and provide oversight to ICE.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's marches are thought to be the largest display of opposition to date to the current immigration policy in the state, as thousands of people walked downtown through temperatures of -23C (-10F). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As they made their way to the city's NBA arena to hold an anti-ICE rally, taking place on the home court of the Minnesota Timberwolves, protesters chanted and played music. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday morning, Minneapolis resident Corey Lamb closed his business, Harriet Grove Botanicals, in solidarity and headed to a protest. He objected to the presence of ICE agents in his city, and was outraged by Good's death in early January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business, and others in his community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a lot of friends that we rely on, we have a lot of businesses that we rely on, in order to make our business work,\" Lamb told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When those individuals are struggling because they're afraid of being detained or disappeared, it has an effect not only morally but economically on what's going on here, and also in the greater Midwest.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lamb's business was joined by hundreds of others, from restaurants and tattoo parlours to toy stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kim Bartmann is the owner of six restaurants in Minneapolis, including four that remain open in the winter but that she shut on Friday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While she supports the cause, she said the decision to participate had been a tricky one, given the costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone is in solidarity, but everyone needs to buy groceries and pay their rents,\" she said, noting that staff at one of her locations had initially asked to stay open, before deciding the risk of backlash over not participating would be too great.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Economically, it is a severe blow to my business,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said sales at her restaurants, which include Barbette and Gigi's Café, have already dropped more than 30% over the past three weeks as a result of the ICE operation, which has prompted her to limit her opening hours as customers and staff stay home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a lot of employees who are US citizens or have paperwork to work in the US who are still terrified to leave their homes,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ICE's presence has outraged many of Minnesota's residents, who have protested against their operations and other federal officers operating in their city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, school officials in the suburb of Columbia Heights announced that four of their students had been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyrrqwxpz7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">detained by ICE, ranging from ages five to 17</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A two-year-old child was also detained on Thursday alongside her undocumented father while returning home from a grocery store in south Minneapolis, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech on Thursday, Vice-President JD Vance called for local Minnesota law enforcement to coordinate with federal officers to carry out immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota, and some of its cities, have so-called \"sanctuary\" policies, which limit the ways that local government and law enforcement cooperates with ICE. The Trump administration has criticised these policies as a threat to public safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a Minneapolis FBI agent resigned this week over concerns about the bureau's handling of the  investigation into Good's shooting, CBS News, the BBC's US partner, reported. The New York Times was first to report the resignation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tracee Mergen left \"in part due to the pressure on her to reclassify/discontinue the investigation\" over Good's death, CBS News reported, citing sources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the FBI for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, US media reported that at least six prosecutors in the Minneapolis US Attorney's office resigned over the administration's handling of the federal investigation. </p></div></div></body></html>"

This is completely up to Greenland,\" she said, which has legal authority over its own land and resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Likewise, Per Stig Moeller, another former Danish Foreign Minister, remains cautious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the situation is \"still very delicate\" and \"might change tomorrow\", pointing to recent meetings in Washington, and the White House's diverging interpretation of what had been agreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why it's very important that we insist, it all happens inside NATO,\" he suggests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land</a> where the US would build military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any sovereignty, making clear that it is a \"red line\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Frederiksen has said it was non-negotiable, although Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued that taking control over Greenland is necessary for the security of the United States, pointing to a growing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response Denmark and its European allies have sought to reassure the US that they'll boost Arctic security, while calling for a more substantive Nato presence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Danish PM Mette Frederiksen, in the centre of the picture wearing a light-brown puffer jacket, walks with the Greenland prime minister and a large crowd towards the camera on an ice-covered street in Nuuk with houses and a church in the background.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Frederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They withdrew bases.

They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trump-cabinet-member-weighs-in-on-alberta-separatism-9.7058082\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos</a> calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymd0d8zvyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">responded in his own speech with</a>: \"Canada lives because of the United States.

People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said.

They were due to be exported to the US for auction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68031028\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In trying to stop their sale</a>, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95.

The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km (186 miles) up the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rapid spate of incidents triggered local and international alarm, with dozens of beaches closed amid fear of further attacks. Predictably, calls for shark culls have gathered momentum and volume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are multiple factors that likely contributed to the recent spate of incidents, they say – and it's not the sharks that are the problem.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127 millimetres of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are shark attacks increasing overall?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after Arctic security <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60837944\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was thrust into the headlines </a>following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that the need for additional defences in the region are urgently needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such a threat is no longer theoretical. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyvmj6mem70o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is \"primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access\", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,\" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a \"business president\" who believed the island represented \"a more robust trading opportunity\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to \"shift the dial\" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,\" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, \"it's all still about potential\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"His logic is that there's a national security imperative,\" Spence said. \"My belief is that this is much more economically driven.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-natalie-sherman\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

It could give a platform to antisemites, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Royal commissions had not been launched into previous tragedies like Port Arthur, Albanese pointed out, comments which were widely dismissed. Promised reviews of intelligence agencies and law enforcement similarly did nothing to dissuade those calling for the inquiry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their pleas were mirrored by a coordinated campaign of letter writing that featured on the front pages of right-wing newspapers. \"I don't think it's controversial to say that the News Limited and other parts of the media were certainly stirring the pot,\" says Warhurst.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese's arguments against a royal commission were \"really hard to make in these circumstances\", says Kenny, and it backfired on him when he was ultimately forced to reverse course on the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have also suggested his reluctance may have been down to fears it could become complex, controversial and divisive. It could invite discussion of the war in Gaza, while potentially excluding examination of Islamophobia – which exploded after Bondi, with The Islamophobia Register Australia recording a 740% rise in incidents by early January - when many Labor MPs have large Muslim electorates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was likely also a \"reluctance to cave to the opposition\", Farr believes: opposition leader Sussan Ley had vociferously demanded the royal commission, asking what Albanese was \"hiding\", and revelled in his backflip.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A political opportunity</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is fair to say that, before December's attack, Ley had been struggling to land a punch on the government and assert authority over her own party. In the weeks before the shooting, some pundits were even predicting her imminent ousting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Bondi attacks offered her an opportunity to prosecute a very strong case against the government,\" says Kenny.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any momentum she gained over the royal commission collapsed this week when she failed to rally her Coalition behind the very hate speech laws she had so loudly demanded Albanese quickly implement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By Thursday - the national day of mourning for the Bondi attacks - things had fallen apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Party announced they were leaving the coalition, having refused to vote for the legislation despite a shadow cabinet agreement. They, despite earlier calls for haste, said they had not been given enough time to examine the proposals which they said could threaten free speech. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Australian Broadcasting Corporation Sussan Ley and David Littleproud\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">David Littleproud on Thursday said his National Party would not work with Sussan Ley</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On his way out the door, Nationals leader David Littleproud suggested the only way his party would consider returning to the fold was if Ley was dumped, leaving her already shaky leadership hanging by a thread.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm quite sure there are people... who are polishing their shoes and tightening the knot on their ties to step forward should that vacancy occur or be forced,\" says Farr.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Littleproud's bold ultimatum could be an overstep which costs him his own job, with mutterings that Liberals wouldn't accept him as a leader in any future coalition either.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, it seems all of Australia's politicians may be on shakier ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The posturing of the main parties over the past month has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Australians.

Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine.

First, he announced a complete overhaul of Vietnam's administration, slashing layers of bureaucracy, cutting the number of provinces from 63 to 34, and laying off at least 100,000 government employees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came Resolution 68, passed on 4 May last year at a meeting of the politburo, the highest decision-making body between party congresses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another country, its statement that the private sector will be \"the most important driving force of the national economy\" would be unremarkable. It was a barely noticeable change from the government's previous stance that it  was \"one important driving force\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in officially socialist Vietnam it marked a sea change, for the first time putting privately-owned businesses on the same level as state-run companies, which in the past had always been extolled as the bedrock of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting in May also announced breathtakingly ambitious targets for the economy: double digit annual growth, doubling the number of private businesses by 2030, and by 2045, the centenary of Vietnam's declaration of independence from French colonial rule, to have created an upper-income, knowledge- and technology-based economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words, to break out of the so-called \"middle income trap\". No other large South East Asian country has managed to do this.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Leading 'cranes'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A central part of his strategy is to back national champions in the private sector – \"leading cranes\" in the party's words – companies big enough to compete on the global stage. In the last Fortune 500 list of top companies in South East Asia 11 of the 100 largest were Vietnamese, and of those only four were privately-owned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most private companies are very small; only 2% employ more than 200 people. To Lam's goal is to have 20 globally competitive private companies by 2030, somewhat like the South Korean model in the 1970s of state-supported conglomerates known as chaebol, which led to the creation of global giants like Hyundai and Samsung.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vietnam's astonishing economic progress over the past 30 years has won it admiration around the world. Its record in poverty reduction is formidable. It turned an isolated, state-run economy which could barely feed its people into one of the world's manufacturing powerhouses. Yet behind these impressive achievements are some big limitations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One is the size of the state-owned sector. Even today, after all this frenetic change and growth, as of 2024, there are 671 state-owned enterprises accounting for 29% of Vietnam's GDP. Their advantages, getting preferential access to licences, government funding and resources like land make it difficult for private companies to compete and thrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even after Resolution 68 appeared to put them in second place, a new Resolution, number 79, was passed earlier this month, presumably after pushback by conservatives inside the party.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images This photo taken on November 4, 2025 shows employees assembling furniture inside the Jonathan Charles Fine Furniture factory in Ho Chi Minh City.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vietnam's economy is fuelled by export-led manufacturing, which makes it especially vulnerable to Trump's tariffs</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This stated that state-owned enterprises could also be \"leading cranes\", and proposed a target of 50 from Vietnam, double the current number, reaching the Fortune 500 list for the region by 2030.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another is the dependence of many Vietnamese industries on foreign investment, foreign technology and overseas markets. Vietnam has become an efficient, low-cost manufacturer of other countries' products. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To Lam himself spoke of this in January last year: \"What percentage of the value do we contribute here? Or are we at the lowest end of the value chain, mainly doing outsourcing for foreign companies? If a shirt is sold with the design, fabric, dye, thread and buttons all sourced from someone else, what do we get?  Perhaps only labour costs and environmental pollution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact the largest manufacturing company there is South Korean, Samsung, and it relies heavily on imported components and technology to make its phones and other electronic goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the challenge faced by most South East Asian countries. Like Vietnam, they saw their economies grow at breakneck speeds as they joined an increasingly complex global supply chain from the 1980s onwards. Poverty fell as people moved to the cities to take up low-end manufacturing jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet today countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are stuck, seemingly unable to move up the value chain and break out of economies dependent on natural resources and manufacturing components for foreign products. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Growth is stagnating, and in Thailand the population is aging quickly. Their largest home-grown companies are in banking, property, energy, telecoms and food. There is no Thai, Malaysian or Indonesian tech giant on the horizon.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could Vietnam be different?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It does have one impressive tech company, FPT, which is now winning contracts with clients like Airbus and several large car manufacturers to help manage and upgrade software.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is reporting revenue of more than $1bn a year, employs 80,000 people across 30 countries and has even built its own university to ensure it has enough graduates with coding and English-language skills to call on. FPT is one of the \"leading cranes\" To Lam is hoping will take Vietnam out of the middle income trap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet FPT is dwarfed by the biggest of the \"leading cranes\", Vingroup, Vietnam's largest private company, which is much more like the traditional, family-owned conglomerates that dominate the economies of other South East Asian countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vingroup is massive. There are Vin homes, Vin hospitals, Vin schools and universities, Vin resorts and amusement parks, Vin solar farms. Vingroup builds expressways, and was the main bidder to build a new high-speed 1,500km (930-mile) railway from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, until it pulled out last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there is Vinfast, the company taking on China to build world-beating electric cars. So far its attempts to break into the US and European markets have been a flop, with its models dismissed as inferior to their competitors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vinfast is thought to have lost as much as $11bn since 2021, but Vingroup is so big, its founder Pham Nhat Vuong so rich, it is willing to keep subsidising its EV experiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vinfast does well at home, thanks to political support from the Communist Party, like the recent ban on all combustion-engined motorbikes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City - Vinfast is the dominant player in electric two-wheelers.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A blue VinFast electric car on the streets of Hanoi surrounded by mopeds.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Although Vinfast cars are yet to break into US or European markets, they are popular in Vietnam </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vin Group will be the biggest of the national champions under To Lam's grand project. But without the political connections at home, success as a global player will be much harder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The main challenge remains unchanged: how to create globally competitive firms without spawning politically-connected rent-seekers\", says Nguyen Khac Giang at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To Lam's approach risks replacing one form of rent-seeking with another. If poorly executed, Vietnam could transition from inefficient state-owned enterprises extracting resources through monopoly positions, to private conglomerates doing the same through political connections. This would crowd out the small-medium enterprises that generate the most employment and innovation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No-one doubts the extraordinary drive and industriousness of the Vietnamese people, nor To Lam's determination to break out of the middle income trap. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without urgent reform we should expect failure, he said in June last year. Yet he is embarking on this journey at an especially difficult time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No other South East Asian country is as reliant as Vietnam on access to the US market, which is now uncertain after President Donald  Trump's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vietnam's famous \"bamboo diplomacy\", attempting to be friends to all, enemies to none, will also be sorely tested in the fraught international relations of the Trump II era.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
