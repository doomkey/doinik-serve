It has not yet announced which countries will be affected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bond said it was clear the government was \"deprioritising\" funding \"for education, gender and countries experiencing humanitarian crises such as South Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, and surprisingly the Occupied Palestinian Territories and Sudan, which the government said would be protected\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is concerning that bilateral funding for Africa, gender, education and health programmes will drop,\" Bond policy director Gideon Rabinowitz said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The world's most marginalised communities, particularly those experiencing conflict and women and girls, will pay the highest price for these political choices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At a time when the US has gutted all gender programming, the UK should be stepping up, not stepping back.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Foreign aid has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, with the one cabinet minister <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4lygdx95vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">admitting the public no longer supports spending on it</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One organisation that escaped the cuts was the World Bank. The Foreign Office confirmed that the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's fund for the world's lowest income countries, would receive £1.98bn in funding from the UK over the next three years, helping the organisation benefit 1.9 billion people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Labour governments under Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown committed to increasing the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of national income.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The target was reached in 2013 under David Cameron's Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, before being enshrined in law in 2015.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, aid spending was cut to 0.5% of national income in 2021 under the Conservatives, blaming the economic pressures of Covid.</p></div></div></body></html>"

findings that Russia had failed in probing attempts to hack US election databases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A declassified copy of the president's daily briefing prepared by US security service chiefs for Obama weeks after Trump beat Clinton and dated 8 December 2016 said: \"We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent US election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the FBI dissented from the findings it had initially co-authored, and a meeting was held at the White House a day later with top officials, according to the report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Afterwards an aide to then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emailed intelligence chiefs asking them to create a new assessment \"per the president's request\" detailing the \"tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gabbard argued the emails showed evidence of a  \"treasonous conspiracy\" to harm Trump, and she threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the justice department for prosecution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Obama's spokesman said in his statement on Tuesday: \"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US intelligence community published an assessment in January 2017 concluding that Russia had sought to damage Clinton's campaign and boost Trump in the vote three months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US officials found this effort had included Russian bot farms on social media and hacking of Democratic emails, but they ultimately concluded the impact was probably limited and did not actually change the election result.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A 2020 bipartisan report by the Senate intelligence committee also found that Russia had tried to help Trump's 2016 campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a senator at the time, was among the Republicans who co-signed that report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The first two years of Trump's first presidency were overshadowed by an investigation from his own justice department into whether he had conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The resulting Mueller report found a lack of evidence that Trump or his campaign co-ordinated with the Kremlin, and no-one was ever charged with such crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A subsequent special counsel inquiry, the Durham report, found the original FBI probe had lacked \"analytical rigor\" and relied on \"raw, unanalysed

BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Australia boasts plenty of superlatives when it comes to its natural landmarks. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's biggest coral reef system on the north-east coast, is rightly recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site. Buzzing with biodiversity, it's a diver's dream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there's a lesser-known record breaker on the other side of the country, on Australia's north-western coast: Ningaloo Reef.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A 14-hour drive north of Perth, Ningaloo is unique. The world's largest fringing reef and another of Australia's Unesco World Heritage Sites, it is home to a lush oceanic forest that spreads out along the coast for hundreds of kilometres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From the region's remote desert beaches, you can wade into vibrant turquoise waters and almost immediately start snorkelling in a seascape as famous for its vibrant corals as the wildlife that surrounds them - manta rays, reef sharks and whale sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this year, Ningaloo has found itself in trouble. Hit by a marine heatwave, higher water temperatures have stressed the corals and they've been turning white, in an effect known as 'bleaching'. While some may recover, it's not a given – and the damage has astounded scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only that, but the heatwave is responsible for another, more worrying  superlative. This is the first time that the reefs on both Australia's western and eastern coasts have been bleached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's like a raging underwater bushfire that has persisted for months now, wreaking harm right along the coast,\" says Paul Gamblin, who heads up the Australian Marine Conservation Society. \"It's an absolutely devastating event and people are reeling from it. It is enormous. It's unprecedented. It's absolutely not normal.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A school of suckerfish, sharksuckers and cobia follow a Whale Shark on Ningaloo Reef\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What's going on?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The marine heatwave that's damaging Ningaloo started in the Caribbean in 2023 . It then made its way across the Indo-Pacific, damaging coral reefs in its path. In 2024, while the Great Barrier Reef saw bleaching,  Ningaloo was spared. But by the end of last year and the beginning of 2025 – peak summer – temperatures had begun to soar in Western Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's all part of the fourth global bleaching event, which experts say has affected more than 80% of the world's coral reefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Kate Quigley, principal research scientist at Minderoo Foundation, likens the effect to a stomach bug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Instead of having bacteria in the human gut, corals have this little algal symbiont that lives inside their cells that allow them to do biological processes,\" she explains, adding that this algae is what gives the corals their colour. When water becomes too warm, that relationship breaks down and bleaching begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So, kind of like, if we got a stomach bug and the human body doesn't function the same way, [it's the] same thing with the coral,\" she explains. \"The warm water causes the biological processes inside that coral to go haywire. And just like humans get sick, corals get sick too.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Of particular worry to Dr Quigley is the prolonged warming scientists have seen. They expected temperatures to drop by April as peak summer passed. This year, that didn't happen.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An arid coastline seen from the air, with turquoise sea waters and dark patches of reef\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Ningaloo is the world's largest fringing reef, home to an oceanic forest that spreads hundreds of kilometres along the coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In previous warming events, water temperatures might have increased for a bit of time and then gone back down again so the corals can essentially recover - they can bounce back,\" explains Dr Quigley. \"But what we're really afraid of seeing, especially in the coming months, is really high levels of death.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While government scientists have been monitoring the reef, there's still a lot they don't know.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The natural world is an incredibly variable place, and sometimes we're... shocked by what we see, [because] it doesn't seem to follow the rules,\" says Dr Tom Holmes, the Marine Science Programme Leader at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in Western Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Holmes and his team are doing follow-up surveys between three and six months after the bleaching to assess how many corals have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There are certainly records of corals [being] in a bleached state for that period of time and still surviving,\" he says. \"So we just need to play the waiting game now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ningaloo attracts around 200,000 tourists to its waters each year. For swimmers and divers, though, the damage is clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was like snorkelling on a corpse,\" says British-South African tourist Jenna-Rae Clark, who has been up and down the coastline of Ningaloo in recent weeks. \"It was so grey and lifeless.

According to Nasa, the ocean is where 90% of global warming is happening – and the last decade was its warmest since the 1800s. Last year was its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/?intent=121\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">warmest on record</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These more worrying superlatives are threatening Australia's famous landmarks.

That way they can better track their health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People ask me, what can we do? Well, the first thing you can do is choose politicians that are considering reducing fossil fuels and are [supportive of] renewable energies,\" says Dr Roelfsema. \"Your vote has a voice for politicians, so you can choose that. But you can also drive less, [use] public transport, not have your air conditioning on all the time - these are all things that can help reduce our footprint.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There's also science being done in the lab.

That brings Dr Quigley back to the bushfire analogy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Interestingly, when bushfires happen here in Australia, the authorities are on it very quickly – there's a lot of response,\" she says. \"You don't see that on the coral reefs in Australia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One reason may be because it's corals at risk, not people. After all, there are no houses in the path of the underwater bushfire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Experts, however, say such a view is shortsighted. Coral reefs are home to 25% of all marine life. But they also look after human life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They are absolutely supercharged with nature and diversity and support the tiniest creatures to the biggest,\" says Paul Gamblin. \"They also support millions of people's livelihoods all over the world, and protect the coast from storm surges and extreme storm events that we're seeing more with climate change. So they provide enormous services to the planet.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These services often get forgotten by those above the surface. But as fossil fuels continue to warm the planet, life in the oceans is feeling the heat.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

From this facility – thought to be the largest of its kind in private hands nationwide – the 38-year-old has sold cubs and breeding pairs for the last 10 years. He is widely considered to be one of the biggest lion dealers in Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades these animals – lions, tigers, pumas, cheetahs and jaguars – have been a sign of power, status and even political fealty in the country. The tiger, for example, is a symbol of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More recently, with the dawn of short video social media apps like TikTok and Instagram, there's been a surge in ownership, with lions now sometimes even brought along to wedding events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the wake of a pet lion escaping and attacking a woman and her two children as they walked down the street in Lahore, the government has launched a crackdown – one which is already impacting people like Fayyaz.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among the new rules, owners must pay a one-time registration fee of 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($176; £129) per animal and farms are to keep a maximum of 10  big cats from no more than two species. The sites must also be open to the public for visits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Violating new laws could result in a fine of up to 200,000 Pakistani rupees and, for the worst offenders, up to seven years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another property on the outskirts of Lahore, five lion cubs – their coats muddied – pace around a cage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But where are the parents?\" a wildlife official asks himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearby, there are several empty cages. Wildlife officials are here after receiving a tip-off that a man was holding lions and cubs without a licence, and was breeding them for sale illegally. By the time they arrived, the owner was missing, leaving his caretaker holding the bag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I was only hired two weeks ago,\" he complains, as he was placed in the back of a truck and taken away for questioning.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The rescued cubs are being isolated for medical checks at Lahore's \"Safari Zoo\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The officials suspect the owner may have taken the cubs' parents away and hidden them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rescued cubs have now been transferred to a public zoo in Lahore, and isolated for medical checks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in a country where big cats have been sold for decades, officials worry the raids are barely scratching the surface. They believe there are in fact hundreds, if not thousands, of undeclared big cats in the state of Punjab alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is going to take at least six months,\" Mubeen Ellahi, the director general of Wildlife &amp; Parks, tells the BBC. He expects 30-40% of the lions in Punjab will not be voluntarily declared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is also another complication. Mubeen explains inbreeding has become a common practice in Pakistan, and some big cats may have to be euthanised. \"They have a lot of health problems. We are still considering the policy,\" he added.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d97/live/aa61c140-6716-11f0-8139-991899391ed8.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fayyaz Fayyaz and his tiger\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Fayyaz</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Fayyaz now has three months to turn his facility into a zoo</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He pointed to another incident in December last year, when another lion escaped in Lahore, and was then shot and killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back at Fayyaz's property, he is considering what to do next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An official told the BBC they're dissatisfied with the size of the cages, and that the farm needs to convert itself into a zoo.

a political shift that meant the sentencing recommendation would come not from the Biden administration, which brought the charges, but from the Trump-led justice department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, that recommendation - a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d135jz58zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">request for Hankison to serve one day in prison</a> - stunned some, including Taylor's family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every American who believes in equal justice under the law should be outraged,\" attorneys for the family said. \"Recommending just one day in prison sends the unmistakable message that white officers can violate the civil rights of Black Americans with near-total impunity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its sentencing request, the justice department argued that although Hankison was involved in \"executing the warrant\" during the deadly raid, he did not shoot Taylor \"and is not otherwise responsible for her death\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The justice department also said that additional prison time \"would simply be unjust under these circumstances\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ordinarily, sentencing recommendations are signed by lawyers involved in the case or career justice department employees who deal with sentencing requests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In this case, Trump's appointee to run the Civil Rights Department, Harmeet Dhillon, signed the recommendation. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What changes has Trump's justice department made?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since returning to the White House, Trump has made rolling back Biden-era policies a priority, particularly at the justice department. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, the justice department began the process of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e663n8glgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">dismissing lawsuits brought against the Louisville and Minneapolis police departments</a> following controversy over high-profile police killings and brutality, including that of Taylor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigations into police constitutional violations in other cities such as Memphis and Phoenix were also ended.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The justice department criticised the Biden administration for enacting \"sweeping\" oversight agreements \"that would have imposed years of micromanagement\" of local police by federal courts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During Biden's tenure, the justice department opened civil investigations into 12 state and local law enforcement agencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In four of those - in Louisville, Minneapolis, Phoenix and Lexington, Mississippi - the department issued reports of systemic police misconduct. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While accountability agreements were made with some of the police departments, they were not formally enacted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These changes have also come amid a mass exodus from the justice department. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the Civil Rights Division alone, the division of the department that made the Hankison sentencing recommendation, about 70% of attorneys have left since Trump was inaugurated, reports say. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Officials have not said why it was flying to Darwin, but it's most likely because the Royal Navy's flagship carrier is still in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the past few days, HMS Prince of Wales has been posting updates and photos on X (formerly Twitter) from the joint exercises it has been conducting off the coast of Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the plane was unable to return, engineers from the ship had visited it to fix it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But as they were unable to repair it, the UK ministry of defence <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/UKDefenceIndia/status/1942145462804636057\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">said</a> a fortnight back that they had deployed a team of 14 engineers \"to Thiruvananthapuram airport to assess and repair the F-35B aircraft\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There had been speculation that if the technicians failed to repair the aircraft, it would have to be partially dismantled and carried out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">F-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.

Among other things, it mandates that every new batch of food must be tested, and that rice, flour and cooking oil must be bought at centralised procurement points. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Authorities in Tianshui have also announced that children suffering from lead poisoning can receive free treatment at designated hospitals and legal assistance will be made available to affected families. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Peixin will be temporarily managed by a state-owned kindergarten. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Justice Varma has denied any wrongdoing by him or his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dhankhar's official schedule had listed a visit to the western city of Jaipur on Wednesday in his capacity as vice president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on Monday evening, he submitted his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu, saying he wanted \"to prioritise health care and abide by medical advice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It has been a privilege and satisfaction to witness and partake in India's remarkable economic progress and unprecedented exponential development during this significant period. Serving in this transformative era of our nation's history has been a true honour,\" Dhankar said in the letter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The abrupt move sent ripples through political circles, with some remarking that they had spoken to Dhankhar just hours before his resignation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What is going on in this government?\" asked Anand Dubey, spokesperson of the Shiv Sena (UBT) party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This decision came without proper consultation or discussion. If health was the concern, the resignation could have been submitted a few days before the session or even after,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Manish Tewari, an MP of India's main opposition Congress party, called the move \"totally unexpected\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"No doubt Mr Dhankhar has to give topmost priority to his health,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But, clearly there is far more to his totally unexpected resignation than meets the eye.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jairam Ramesh, another Congress MP, called Dhankar's resignation \"unprecedented\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also pointed to the absence of two ministers from an advisory committee meeting presided over by Dhankar that was supposed to happen on Monday afternoon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ramesh said Dhankar was not personally informed of their absence and took \"umbrage\" before rescheduling the meeting for Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Jagdeep Dhankar's resignation speaks highly of him. It also speaks poorly of who got him elected as vice president in the first instance,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dhankar, a lawyer by profession, first entered politics as an MP from Rajasthan's Jhunjhunu seat in 1989.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2003, he joined the BJP and went on to head the party's legal department. In 2019, he was appointed the governor of West Bengal state where he was often at loggerheads with the state government, run by the Trinamool Congress party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He resigned as governor in 2022 after the BJP nominated him as vice president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dhankhar underwent angioplasty in Delhi in March but quickly resumed his duties and remained active in parliament.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With the vice president's seat now vacant, his responsibilities are likely to be handled by the deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha or another member designated by the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The mystery - and the nationwide attention it attracted - left the small Idaho town reeling while obsessive amateur internet sleuths tried to fill in the blanks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Finally, on 30 December, after weeks of unanswered questions, police announced they had arrested a suspect, Kohberger, at his family home hundreds of miles away in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A crime with no motive</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly three years later, there is no public explanation why Kohberger murdered the four students, to whom he had no known connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kohberger himself has not offered any reasons, only entering a guilty plea in court to planning and carrying out the stabbings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Journalists and members of the public have sought answers, digging into Kohberger's past, and finding old writings online about struggles with depression, his lack of remorse and a former heroin addiction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He had a fascination with criminals, studying under true crime writer and forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland, who expressed shock that a man she viewed as polite and respectful could have committed such crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">​​\"I thought, 'they have to have this wrong,'\" she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/kohberger-serial-killer-teacher-ramsland.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">told</a> the New York Times. \"It's not the Bryan Kohberger that I know.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kohberger would eventually pursue a criminology doctorate at Washington State University, where he was fired from his job as a teaching assistant for evaluating students too harshly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Newly released documentaries and books - including one by thriller novelist James Patterson - have speculated about his motive, suggesting that he was angry about romantic rejections, or even that he was trying to emulate <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43892189\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">misogynist killer Elliot Rodger</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A gag order in the case prevented those close to the investigation from speaking out.

A private Facebook group about the case gained more than 30,000 members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Relatives and friends of the victims were bombarded with messages, some accusing - without any evidence - grieving roommates and others who were close to the victims of being involved in the murders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some descended on the small college town, trying to access the boarded house, surrounded with caution tape. The frenzy frustrated local law enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,\" the Moscow Police Department said at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Behind the scenes, investigators were combing through thousands of tips from the public, cell phone records and video surveillance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several pieces of evidence helped them eventually piece together the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A white Hyundai Elantra car captured in footage near the scene of the crime matched Kohberger's vehicle. Cell phone records put the 30-year-old near the Moscow off-campus home at the time of the murders, and suggested he drove by the house repeatedly leading up to, then hours after, the crime, before roommates learned of the horrible scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps the most important piece of evidence came from a key item left behind: a knife sheath with DNA that matched a sample taken from trash at Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania, where officials would finally track him down during his holiday break.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A small town tries to move past tragedy</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A house where four students were murdered is cordoned off\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The house where the four students were murdered has since been destroyed</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 1122 King Road, just a few streets away from the centre of the University of Idaho's campus, the grey-shuttered three-story home no longer sits on a slope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A year after the murders, the school decided to tear down the off-campus house where the four students were killed, calling it a \"grim reminder\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[I]t is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue,\" the university said at the time, eliciting mixed reactions from the victims' relatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With a guilty plea for Kohberger now secured, Mogen's family agrees that it is time to turn from \"tragedy and mourning\" to \"the light of the future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her father has said the marketing student was \"known for her ability to make others smile and laugh\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Goncalves, Mogen's good friend, was a \"defender and protector\" of her family who \"did absolutely everything she set her mind to\", relatives said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chapin's mother said her son, who was a triplet, was \"the life of the party\" and \"the kindest person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kernodle was a strong-willed student who was with her friends \"all the time\", her father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To honour their memories, university students last year built a circular steel structure engraved with the four students' names, where visitors have come to lay flower bouquets, stones, candles and notes remembering their lost friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lying in a grassy memorial garden, the top of the structure lights up at night, one of the sole remaining signs of a tragedy that shook the small Idaho town.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

roughly the equivalent of the population of Tunisia or Belgium.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF had seized Khartoum soon after the war started in April 2023, following a massive fall-out between Gen Burhan and his then-ally, the paramilitary group's commander, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as \"Hemedti\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF helped Burhan stage a coup in 2021 and crush dissent until they turned on each other after Gen Dagalo resisted his plan to integrate the paramilitary force into the army.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">International Crisis Group think-tank analyst Alan Boswell told the BBC that the army now wanted to defeat the RSF in Kordofan so that it could push westwards into Darfur - the paramilitary group's birthplace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the other hand, the RSF wanted to seize Kordofan as it would give it \"new momentum\" and put it \"within striking distance of central Sudan, including the capital, again\", Mr Boswell said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Suliman Baldo, the director of Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker think-tank, told the BBC that he doubted the army could break through RSF defence lines in Kordofan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the majority of RSF fighters were from the large Misseriya ethnic group living in West Kordofan state, which borders Darfur, \"and therefore they will be fighting to protect their own communities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Airstrikes earlier this month by the army in West Kordofan - including its capital, el-Fula, and the town of Abu Zabad - have also antagonised locals, he said, adding that it was a \"counterproductive policy of collective punishment of the so-called social incubators\" of the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The army still controls oil fields in the region, but the RSF had threatened to expand the war to oil-producing Heglig in South Kordofan, near the border with South Sudan, if the air bombardment did not stop.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If the army's aviation returns again and bombs citizens in West Kordofan state, we will strike and shut down Heglig's oil and kill the engineers,\" Youssef Awadallah Aliyan, the head of the RSF's civilian administration in the state, was quoted as saying by the Sudan Tribune news site after visiting the market hit by airstrikes in el-Fula.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said the strikes on el-Fula and Abu Zabad, including on a school sheltering families, reportedly killed more than 20 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ocha condemned the attacks, saying that civilians and civilian buildings - including schools, homes, and shelters - should \"never be targeted\", and warring groups should uphold international humanitarian law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF has also been accused of targeting civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN children's agency (Unicef) said more than 450 civilians -

And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Suddenly everyone wanted to know about her  - and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and  spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge – there was no real woman behind the online sensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact \"pure revenge\" on her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast  - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Babydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021. The initial photos were her real pictures that had been morphed, Ms Agarwal said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As time passed, Bora used tools such as ChatGPT and Dzine to create an AI version.

The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says. And people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Much of the weaponry used in Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) strikes on the strip has been built or sold by Western nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But information around the extent of the UK's military support to Israel often remains unclear or classified, and some MPs have called for a public inquiry into the extent of the assistance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Does the UK supply Israel with arms?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK is not one of Israel's main suppliers of arms. The US is by far the biggest seller - helping Israel develop one of the world's most advanced militaries - followed by Germany and Italy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since 2015, the UK has approved arms export licences to Israel worth over £500m ($676.4m) -  peaking in 2018, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://caat.org.uk/data/exports-uk/overview?region=Israel&amp;date_from=2015-04\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) pressure group</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, much of the attention around the UK's support for Israel has focussed on parts made in Britain for the F-35 jet. A state-of-the-art multi-role fighter, it has been used extensively by Israel to strike Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK supplies between 13-15% of the components used in the jet, including ejector seats, rear fuselage, active interceptor systems, targeting lasers and weapon release cables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the Labour Party came to power last year, it suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licences, affecting equipment such as parts for fighter jets, helicopters and drones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Any UK company that wants to sell arms abroad must apply for a licence, and the government said at the time that there was a \"clear risk\" the equipment could be used to commit serious violations of international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But crucially, parts for the F-35 were not included in the export ban. The government said it could not prevent Israel obtaining these components as they are sent to manufacturing centres abroad as part of a global programme - not directly to Israel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professor Anna Stavrianakis, an expert in UK Arms Export, described the government's decision to allow for this exemption as \"an enormous loophole\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"UK-made parts for the F-35 mostly go to the USA, where they are incorporated into jets bound for Israel,\" she told BBC Verify, noting that because the White House \"does not want to stop supporting Israel\", the UK export bans were quite limited in their effectiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK also co-developed the Hermes drone, which has been widely used in Gaza. While the UK version of the aircraft, called the Watchkeeper 450, is unarmed, the Israeli-made Hermes drone can be armed with Spike missiles and was reportedly used in the attack that killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is hard to say what the UK is still exporting to Israel under the active licences. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said last year that the ban was not a \"blanket ban or an arms embargo\" and said it remained essential that Israel could defend itself from attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Department of Business and Trade, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-9964/CBP-9964.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">161 of the extant licences relate to military products.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A UK Parliament report said that the remaining licences could include \"items such as trainer aircraft and naval equipment, and dual-use items for civilian use in telecoms and data equipment\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Has the UK shared intelligence with Israel?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The extent to which the UK has shared intelligence with Israel since the 7 October attacks is unclear.

For example, thousands of Ukrainian troops have come to Britain since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 for basic training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lord Coaker - a minister of state at the UK MoD - said in April that \"fewer than 10\" IDF personnel have been trained on non-combat military academic courses in the UK every year since 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He declined to say exactly how many IDF troops had taken part in courses over that time, or what classes they had taken \"in order to protect personal information\". But ministers have insisted that the courses emphasise the importance of complying with international humanitarian law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard confirmed in June that \"a limited number of Israel Defense Forces personnel\" were taking part in UK-based training courses, but declined to offer further details.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Has the UK sanctioned Israel for its actions in Gaza?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK's approach to holding Israel accountable for its campaign in Gaza changed after the general election in 2024.

In Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed that the Palestinians were a problem to be managed. The real threat, he insisted, was Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu's rhetoric opposing Hamas was undimmed, but he had also given permission for Qatar to funnel money into Gaza. It gave him space for his real priorities in foreign policy - confronting Iran and finding a way to normalise relations with Saudi Arabia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Washington, then-President Joe Biden and his administration believed they were close to hatching a deal between the Saudis and Israelis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was all a series of illusions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has refused to establish an enquiry to look into the mistakes he made alongside his army and security chiefs that gave Hamas its opportunity to attack with such deadly effect on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The century-long conflict between Jews and Arabs for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean was unresolved, festering, and about to explode into a war that looks to be as consequential as its other landmarks, in 1948 and 1967.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Middle East has been transformed since 7 October, and almost two years into the war, the conflict in Gaza is at another inflection point.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has been a hard war for journalists to report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They were taken by surprise on 7 October when Hamas attacked, and since then Israel has banned international journalists from Gaza to report freely. Palestinian journalists inside the Strip have done valiant work, and nearly 200 have been killed doing their jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But key facts are clear. Hamas committed a series of war crimes in the attacks it launched on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, mainly Israeli civilians. Hamas took 251 hostages, of which perhaps 20 who are still being held inside Gaza are believed to be alive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And there is clear evidence that Israel has committed a series of war crimes since then.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's list includes the starvation of Gaza's civilians, the failure to protect them during military operations in which Israeli forces killed tens of thousands of innocents, and the wanton destruction of entire towns in a manner that is not proportionate to the military risk Israel faces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu and his former defence minister are the subject of arrest warrants for war crimes issued by the International Criminal Court. They insist on their innocence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has also condemned a legal process at the International Court of Justice which alleges that it is committing genocide against Palestinians. Israel denies the accusations, and claims they are antisemitic \"blood libels\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel is running out of friends. Allies who rallied around after the 7 October Hamas attacks have lost patience with Israel's conduct in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even Israel's most important ally, Donald Trump, is reported to be losing patience with Netanyahu after being taken by surprise when the Israeli leader ordered the bombing of Damascus – attacking Syria's new regime, which Trump has recognised and encouraged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Other western allies of Israel ran out of patience months ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another joint statement, condemning Israel's actions, was signed on 21 July by foreign ministers from the UK, much of the European Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They used strong words to describe civilian suffering in Gaza, and the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c15wz2ee05do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">failing and deadly aid distribution system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)</a> that Israel introduced to replace tried and trusted methods used by the UN and leading global relief groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/joint-statement-on-the-occupied-palestinian-territories\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the statement</a> said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity. We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Israeli Government's denial of essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable. Israel must comply with its obligations under international humanitarian law.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">David Lammy, Britain's foreign secretary, followed the joint statement with one of his own, using similar language, in the House of Commons in Westminster. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was not enough for Labour MPs, who want strong words to be backed by strong actions. One told me there was \"fury\" at the government's reluctance to act more decisively. Top of their agenda is recognition of a Palestinian state, which has already been done by a majority of members of the United Nations. The UK and France have discussed doing so jointly, but so far seem to believe the time is not right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's parliament, known as the Knesset, is only days away from its summer recess, which will last until October. That means Benjamin Netanyahu will have a break from the threat of a vote of no confidence from the extremist nationalists in his coalition who oppose a ceasefire in Gaza. His reluctance to negotiate a truce is a result of their threats to quit his government. If Netanyahu lost power in an election, his day of reckoning for his 7 October mistakes - as well as the end of his long running corruption trial - would race towards him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A ceasefire is looking more possible, a chance of survival for Gaza's civilians and for the Israeli hostages who have been prisoners of Hamas for so long.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">None of that means the conflict will end. The war has taken it to new depths. But if there is a ceasefire there will be another chance to switch from killing to diplomacy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Seconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why \"did he cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/air-india-crash-senior-pilot-eab72db5\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/air-india-cockpit-recording-suggests-captain-cut-fuel-engines-before-crash-2025-07-18/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Reuters</a> news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Italian newspaper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.corriere.it/economia/trasporti/aerei/25_luglio_18/air-india-comandante-trappola-2db9160e-9395-4daf-8746-fa0278faaxlk.shtml\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Corriere della Sera</a> claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Understandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aaib.gov.in/What's%20New%20Assets/APPEAL%20VT-ANB%2017-07-2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">selective and unverified reporting</a>\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1946299060060610699\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">\"premature and speculative\"</a> and that “investigations of this magnitude take time\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents several possibilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Peter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Indian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ai-crash-probe-looks-for-vital-clues-of-electric-malfunction-in-tail-wreckage-10137487/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">electrical fire in the tail</a> as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Summing up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.</p></div></div></body></html>"
