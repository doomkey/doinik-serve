He said 12 people had been rescued, but dozens were unaccounted for. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most of the victims are believed to be Ethiopian nationals, said the IOM.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yemen is a major pathway for migrants from the Horn of Africa travelling to Gulf states in search of work.

The Iran-backed Houthi group has controlled much of north-western Yemen since 2014, when they ousted the internationally-recognised government from the capital, Sanaa.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At least 27 Palestinians were killed, hospitals in Gaza say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli hostages Braslavski, 21, and David, 24, were abducted from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023 during the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are among 49 hostages, out of 251 originally taken, who Israel says are still being held in Gaza. This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would \"respond positively\" to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Other Rom Braslavski lies on the ground, only his head visible, crying\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Other</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A still of a video released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad showing Rom Braslavski </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days...

The BBC believes the madams have moved location since then. The police said the women and young girls we filmed could not be traced. To date there have been no arrests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Convictions are rare in Kenya. For successful prosecutions, police need testimonies from children. Often vulnerable minors are too afraid to testify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC's grainy footage filmed on the street in the dark showed one woman, who calls herself Nyambura, laughing as she says: \"They're still children, so it's easy to manipulate them by just handing them sweets.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Undercover filming in Maai Mahiu with the madams and some of their young victims</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Prostitution is a cash crop in Maai Mahiu; the truckers basically fuel it. And that's how we benefit. It's been normalised in Maai Mahiu,\" she explained, adding that she had one girl as young as 13, who had already been \"working\" for six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It becomes very risky when you're dealing with minors. You can't just bring them out openly in town. I only sneak them out at night in great secrecy,\" Nyambura said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The act of prostitution by a consenting adult is not explicitly criminalised under Kenyan national law but it is banned by many municipal by-laws. It is not banned in Maai Mahiu, which is part of Nakuru county.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the penal code it is illegal to live from the earnings of prostitution, either as a sex worker or third party facilitating or profiting from prostitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trafficking or sale of minors under the age of 18 carries a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked whether the clients wear condoms, Nyambura said she usually made sure they had  protection but the odd one did not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Some children want to earn more [so don't use them]. Some are forced [not to use them],\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In another meeting, she led the undercover investigator to a house where three young girls sat huddled on a sofa, another on a hard-backed chair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nyambura then left the room, giving the investigator an opportunity to speak to the girls alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They described being repeatedly abused for sex, on a daily basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sometimes you have sex with multiple people.

We also have our regulars who always come back for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cheptoo took the undercover investigator to a club to meet four of her girls.

She was pregnant and had her three young children with her after fleeing her husband because of domestic violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At her wooden kitchen table in a bright parlour at the front of her house, she introduced the BBC to four young women who were all forced into sex work by madams in Maai Mahiu when they were children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each girl shared similar stories of broken families or abuse at home - they came to Maai Mahiu to escape, only to be violently abused again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Michelle described how, at 12 years old, she lost her parents to HIV and was evicted on to the streets where she met a man who gave her somewhere to live and began sexually abusing her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I literally had to pay him in kind for educating me. I reached my limit, but I had no-one,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two years later, she was approached by a woman who turned out to be a madam in Maai Mahiu and forced her into sex work.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lilian, who is now 19, also lost her parents at a very young age. She was left with an uncle who filmed her in the shower and sold the images to his friends. The voyeurism soon turned into rape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That was my worst day. I was 12 then.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When she escaped, she was raped again by a truck driver who took her to Maai Mahiu. It was here, like Michelle, where she was approached by a woman who forced her into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These young women's short lives have been fuelled by violence, neglect and abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, housed by Baby Girl, they are learning new skills - two in a photography studio and two in a beauty salon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They also assist Baby Girl with her outreach work in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nakuru county has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya, and Baby Girl, supported by US aid agency USAID, is on a mission to educate people about the risks of unprotected sex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She has an office at Karagita Community Health Centre, near Lake Naivasha, where she works providing condoms and advice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, with US President Donald Trump's decision to pull USAID funding, her outreach programmes are about to stop.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">As part of her outreach work, Baby Girl hands out condoms on the streets near Lake Naivasha in Nakuru county</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"From September we will be unemployed,\" she told the BBC World Service, adding how worried she was about the young women and girls who depend on her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You see how vulnerable these children are.

Everything feels extravagant, emotional and larger than life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now imagine all of that without the bride and groom. No pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual where the couple takes seven rounds around a sacred fire), no relatives, no tearful farewells. Just the party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Welcome to the world of fake weddings - a rising trend in Indian cities where people gather to enjoy the wedding party, minus the actual marriage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These ticketed events, organised by hotels, clubs and companies, are designed purely for fun and promise to offer the full experience of a wedding party without any stress, rituals or responsibilities. Simply put, it's a wedding-themed party night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the past few weeks, fake weddings have been making a splash in big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The attendees are usually young people looking to enjoy a night out with friends, indulging in the drama and fun of a traditional Indian wedding without the attendant pressures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, we attended one such curated event in Delhi - a fake sangeet<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i>(a sangeet is a night of music and dance usually held a few days before the wedding).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the event, held at a plush club, the vibe was electric: women twirled in sequinned saris and lehengas (long skirts and blouses), men showed up in tailored kurtas and ethnic jackets. A traditional dhol drummer led the crowd to the dance floor and tequila-filled gol gappas (a popular Indian street snack) made the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shivangi Sareen, who attended an event like this for the first time, found it \"amazing\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Shivangi Sareen, right, said the fake sangeet was a memorable experience</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At family weddings, there's so much pressure - the rules around dressing up, the judgement [from relatives]. But here, it's just fun,\" she said. \"Especially because we got to do it all with our friends. We decided our outfits the day before and got ready together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ticket prices typically start at around 1,500 rupees ($17; £13) and can go up to 15,000 rupees or more, depending on the venue and facilities. Shivangi and her friends paid 10,000 rupees per couple to attend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I wouldn't mind spending this once a month. The whole experience was totally worth it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sharad Madan, owner of a restaurant which hosted the event, says the trend underscores that novelty is key in the hospitality sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to keep doing something new for our patrons,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It cost them around a million rupees to plan and organise the event, Mr Madan says, and the team expected to make double that through ticket sales. But it's not just about profits, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's about engagement. Even if it doesn't give me the same kind of returns, I would still do it because our patrons want something different.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kaushal Chanani, co-founder of 8Club events which hosted a fake wedding party attended by 2,000 people in Bengaluru last month, says that the inspiration for fake weddings came from young Indians living abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People from the diaspora would gather and dance to Bollywood music, dress in ethnic [traditional] clothes and enjoy the evening,\" he said. \"This is the idea we followed as well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The response to the Bengaluru event, held at a five-star hotel, was \"overwhelming\", he says. It encouraged them to plan a similar event in Delhi - which was sold out - and they started getting queries from event organisers in other cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata and Lucknow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We now give out our standard operating procedure (SOP) to people who are interested,\" he says. \"It is a guide on how to create the experience, market it and make it profitable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, not all fake weddings follow the same script.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Trippy Tequila A woman dancing while showing her back.

Alcohol was deliberately left out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sometimes booze takes away from the experience,\" Mr Pandey said. \"We wanted to do more than just a pub night or a regular takeover. We wanted to showcase the spirit of Indian weddings.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Commentators say the popularity of these events reflects young people's growing desire to find reasons to celebrate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People need a hook of some kind… an occasion to celebrate. And there's no better setting than a wedding, which brings together all the elements of fun,\" says writer and social commentator Santosh Desai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's the pinnacle of enjoyment - especially when it's free from the stress that accompanies real weddings.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also points out that these events give people a reason to re-wear expensive wedding outfits bought in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, are such events here to stay?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Event planner Vijay Arora, founder of Delhi-based Touchwood Events, believes fake weddings are currently a fad - but one with potential.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Gen Z definitely wants to be part of such celebrations,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If it emerges as a new market category then it can be a major game changer since the scale will increase - which eventually amps up business opportunities for the entire industry.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's wedding industry <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wrightresearch.in/blog/analyzing-indias-booming-dollar130-billion-wedding-industry-wright-videos/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">is estimated to be worth around $130bn</a>, according to investment advisory firm Wright Research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While the sector is booming, there are constraints. Most weddings take place during the cooler months - typically between November and March - and often at auspicious times, while the monsoon season (June to August) is considered off-season.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With venues free, vendors available and people constantly chasing experiences, fake weddings could step in to fill the gap if the trend holds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Arora says he was surprised by the rise of fake weddings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But it also helps in understanding that such events are something that we want to celebrate or be a part of. Even if we can't attend the real events our friends or family host, we still want to experience them by joining these fake ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, not every guest walks away thrilled.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Third Place People wearing traditional Indian clothes participate in games at a fake wedding party \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Third Place</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Some fake wedding events include tarot readings or astrology-themed games</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Srishti Sharma, a 23-year-old Bengaluru-based marketing professional, said she was underwhelmed by the only fake wedding she attended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I've lived away from home for a few years now and I really missed attending a wedding,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The biggest plus was not having nagging relatives telling you 'you're next in line to get married'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Sharma and her friends spent hours picking outfits, but the event fell short.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They began with EDM and switched to Bollywood only after two hours,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expected wedding food but got pizza and fries - no dessert, just alcohol.

One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The biggest embassy in Europe</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China bought the old Royal Mint Court for £255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Carmen fled to London but believes she has continued to be targeted</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you.

More than 300 women turned up to share their experiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK study is not an outlier.

South Korean serums are better-suited for her skin compared to some Western brands that tend to be more harsh, the 27-year-old graphic designer says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now \"95% of my skincare is made up of K-beauty products\", she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Mak is not alone in her preference for South Korean skincare brands. Americans spent as much $1.7bn (£1.3bn) on K-beauty products in 2024, according to industry estimates. That marks a more than 50% rise compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">K-beauty products are often more attractively priced than their Western counterparts - but also feature ingredients that are not as commonly found in the West - from heartleaf to snail mucin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US President Donald Trump has now imposed a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpvl9krxwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">15% import tax on South Korean goods</a> traded between Seoul and Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's less than the 25% levy that Trump had threatened, but many consumers are not taking any chances. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US K-beauty retailer Santé Brand saw orders spike by nearly 30% in April, right after Trump unveiled sweeping US import taxes on most of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the tariff announcements hit, customers got strategic with how they were going to weather the storm,\" Santé Brand's founder Cheyenne Ware told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Consumers are preparing against the uncertainty.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another K-beauty retailer, Senti Senti, has been ordering more products since Trump started his tariff threats, says manager Winnie Zhong. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This week, she received alerts from suppliers urging retailers to \"stock up before tariffs\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both retailers said prices of K-beauty products are likely to increase as the levies push up costs across the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Anyone telling you prices will stay flat through the next two years is naive,\" says Ms Ware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prices are bound to rise, especially for smaller sellers of beauty products on platforms like Amazon, who operate with slim profit margins, economist Munseob Lee from the University of California San Diego says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite higher prices, the global popularity of South Korean culture means K-beauty products are likely to remain in demand in the US, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Casual buyers might be turned off by the higher price, but fans won't find an easy substitute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Zhong agrees.
