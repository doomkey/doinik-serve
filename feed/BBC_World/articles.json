We've done, they've done a phenomenal job.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the interview, the president added that his administration was \"reviewing everything\" about Pretti's death and said that it \"will come out with a determination\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun. Local authorities say the gun was legally registered, he was not brandishing it, and he was shot after the gun was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has described Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment saying \"the sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62r4g590wqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets</a>.

One conducted by Politico shortly after Renee Good's death this month suggested about half of Americans felt the mass deportation campaign was too aggressive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as \"EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States\" must \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He listed a series of requests that he said were \"rooted in common sense\", most notably petitioning US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of \"all these problems\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging \"left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

agents and Pretti just before the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvg812n01no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a \"full investigation\" into the killing of Pretti.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, it said: \"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were seeking Jose Huerta Chuma during a \"targeted\" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims, and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanor-level traffic offenses from more than a decade ago.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Unpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by

agent shot dead Renee Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident who was taking part in such an observation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, Good's family law firm Romanucci &amp; Blandin urged all Americans to \"trust their own eyes as they interpret the horrific video\" of Pretti's shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their statement went on: \"It is time for a hard reset. ICE agents can leave Minneapolis. The residents of Minnesota cannot. We call for a complete and immediate end to the ICE invasion of this beautiful American city.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes.

A crackdown on illegal immigration was central to his successful re-election campaign and is backed by many around the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety efffort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US.

Other state and local officials have echoed Walz's view.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.

A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He felt he had two options: \"Go to the police and say, 'I'm in the Interpol system,'\" and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean \"you can't rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked\", which is what happened to him, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's constant nerves, all the time,\" he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country.  The police can \"break into your house at any time… that's why you're like a cornered rat\", he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you,\" that breaks families apart, he adds.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says it wasn't just that he was against \"having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to\" but that \"it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency's checks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol's internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), arguing that Russia's request was politically motivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol's constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used \"to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images A firefighter is standing on a ladder next to a light grey multi-storey building which has white smoke pouring out of it.

He showed us CCF documents that said the information Russia had provided was \"generic and formulaic\" and there had been an \"inadequate explanation\" of the alleged crime. Interpol cancelled the request for Pestrikov's detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol only releases very basic data about illegitimate requests for arrests and since 2018 has not revealed which countries are the subject of complaints and inquiries. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the scale of the problem, but for the first time, the leaked documents reveal a much fuller picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One batch of files shared with the BBC contains a list of complaints sent to the CCF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The data is not complete, but it covers a broad range of countries, and where the nation requesting an arrest is listed, there are more complaints about Russia than anywhere else - this has been the case for the past 11 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files also show that in the past decade, at least 700 people who were wanted by Russia complained to the CCF, and at least 400 of them had their red notices or diffusions overturned - that is more than for any other country, according to the data we received.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The files show Russia attempted to use Interpol's messaging system to get information about journalist Armen Aramyan after he left the country</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Historically it has been Russia who is one of the main perpetrators of abusive red notices,\" says British barrister Ben Keith, who has represented many clients wishing to have their names removed from Interpol's wanted lists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He thinks Interpol has a particular problem with Russia and that the agency's attempts to prevent abuse have not been successful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says that he has \"a steady flow of clients who are subject to Russian red notices who are either politically connected, or often pro-Ukraine, or alternatively as a result of corporate raiding\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International lawyer Yuriy Nemets, who specialises in Interpol matters and extradition, agrees that Interpol's extra scrutiny of Russia's requests for arrests, introduced after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has not proved effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is aware of a number of cases in which Russians opposed to the war \"have been targeted for speaking out against what's going on and were charged with financial… or other ordinary crimes and put into the database based on that\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not hard to game the system,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as information on notices and complaints, the Interpol insider also provided the BBC with thousands of messages sent between individual countries via Interpol's messaging system, revealing another, less formal route to trace people abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One message from Moscow to law enforcement agents in Abu Dhabi explained how Interpol had denied a request for a red notice, but that it still wanted help in tracing the subject's whereabouts.

The exchange relating to Karakulov happened after Interpol announced its additional vetting of Moscow.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool via REUTERS Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova sit on opposite sides of a desk.

And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even while concerns about Russia's misuse of Interpol's systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This seems to have been settled in Moscow's favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its \"strict rules on the processing of data\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was \"concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol's systems\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Russia's ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. \"If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time,\" says Keith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, \"with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting: Andreea Jitaru and Ned Davies</b></i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully,\" Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. \"As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours\", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Bureau Chief of BBC in India Sir Mark Tully recording a despatch from the historic Jama Masjid in Delhi, May 10, 1994.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the world</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Sir William Mark Tully in Delhi\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBC</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan.

He described the award as \"an honour to India\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continued to write books about India - essays, analyses, short stories too, sometimes in collaboration with his partner, Gillian Wright. He lived un-ostentatiously in south Delhi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Mark never gave up his British nationality but was proud also to become late in life an Overseas Citizen of India. That made him, he said, \"a citizen of the two countries I feel I belong to, India and Britain\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the moments before the shooting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him.

This year, it will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has invited them as chief guests for the celebrations, placing the European Union at the centre of one of the country's most prestigious state events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this day, India turns the heart of its capital into a stage.

Over the decades, the choice of chief guest has come to be closely watched as an indicator of India's foreign policy priorities and the relationships Delhi wants to highlight at a particular moment, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The practice began in 1950 with the then Indonesian president, Sukarno, attending India's first Republic Day parade.

The chief guests have been from leaders of neighbouring countries - such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka - to heads of state and government from major powers, including the US and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has featured as the chief guest five times - including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - reflecting the long and complex history between the two countries.

Following the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyr6p30054o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest Russian bombardment </a>overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither?

Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services.

They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are shark attacks increasing overall?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
