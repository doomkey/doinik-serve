The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards, some experts believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Volunteers give out food and drinks after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Hundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to some</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Residents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year.

US officials are heading to Moscow next week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak underlined his leading role in those negotiations when he told The Atlantic website hours before news of the searches emerged that \"as long as Zelensky is president, no-one should count on us giving up territory.

primarily of North African descent - at a Montreal elementary school were suspended after a government report said they had created a toxic environment for students and staff, and largely avoided certain subjects like science and sex education.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the teachers had tried to introduce \"Islamist\" beliefs and vowed to strengthen secularism measures in schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.quebec.ca/gouvernement/politiques-orientations/laicite-etat/comite-etude-respect-laicite\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a government-mandated committee</a> released a report with recommendations including a ban on religious symbols for daycare workers and the phasing out of public funding for private religious schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And last month, the Legault government passed a law extending secularism rules to staff who interact with students in public primary and high schools, and barring students from wearing face coverings. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95e0/live/c8a8f470-cbcf-11f0-8e93-71481b645865.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images A man is black athletic clothes runs by a blue sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French 'I choose secularism'\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A sign for the federal Bloc Québécois that reads in French \"I choose secularism\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Quebec's secularism law?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bill 21 prohibits public officials in positions of authority - such as judges, police officers, teachers and public servants  - from wearing religious symbols such as the kippah, turban or hijab while at work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also requires public services to be provided and received with the face uncovered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Bill 21, the Quebec government invoked the \"notwithstanding clause\" - a part of the Canadian constitution that allows government to override \"fundamental freedoms\" of religion, expression, and association, as well as the right to life, liberty and security of the person, and freedom from discrimination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It essentially serves an opt-out that prevents courts from striking down the legislation on constitutional grounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bill 21 does not mention any specific religion and would include symbols worn by a person of any faith, including Christians, and affirms the religious neutrality of the province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics argue it targets mostly religious minorities, especially women of Muslim faith. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law has faced a number of legal challenges in Quebec. Canada's Supreme Court has now agreed to take up the case, which will hinge both on the law itself and the use of the notwithstanding clause. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate over secularism - broadly, the principle that religion and government institutions should be separate - has played a significant role in the province's public discourse for almost two decades. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Known in the majority French-speaking province as laïcité, it has been an important value in Quebec society since the 1960s as the Catholic Church's strong influence began to wane in the province.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A September survey by polling firm Leger, commissioned by media outlets Le Journal de Montréal and TVA, indicated that 68% of respondents thought secularism was an important value. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar legislation to Bill 21 is in place in various countries across the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France passed a ban on veils, crosses and other religious symbols in schools in 2004 and on face covering in public spaces in 2010. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They are surrounded by a number of Israeli border guards. They then kneel on the ground. One of them lifts his t-shirt, apparently to show that he is not armed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a short period, they move back into the building. Border police then open fire, killing them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A joint statement from the IDF and police said forces had been trying to apprehend wanted individuals who had carried out \"terror activities\", including throwing explosives and firing at security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The forces entered the area, enclosed the structure in which the suspects were located, and initiated a surrender procedure that lasted several hours,\" the statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Following the use of engineering tools on the structure, the two suspects exited. Following their exit, fire was directed toward the suspects.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Writing on X, Ben-Gvir said \"the fighters acted exactly as expected of them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The raid in Jenin is the latest in a months-long Israeli campaign in cities in the northern West Bank, which Israel says is necessary to tackle Palestinian armed groups it says were responsible for attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. On Wednesday the Israeli military launched an operation in the nearby city of Tubas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Violence in the West Bank has spiked since the Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023, which led to a devastating Israeli military campaign in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli troops or settlers have killed more than 1,000 Palestinians, including members of armed groups and civilians, in the West Bank since then, the UN says.

They include the southern Crimean peninsula, annexed in 2014, and the eastern Donbas region, which Moscow now occupies for the most part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Kyiv, which has ruled out relinquishing the parts of the Donbas it still holds, rewarding Russia for its aggression is a non-starter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking after Putin's address, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia \"scorned\" efforts \"to truly end the war\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters during a trip to Kyrgyzstan, Putin accused Kyiv of wanting to fight \"to the last Ukrainian\" - which he said Russia was \"in principle\" also ready to do. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He repeated his view that Russia has the initiative on the battlefield and the fighting would only end when Ukrainian troops withdrew from Donbas, which is made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they don't withdraw, we'll achieve this by force of arms,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Russia's slow gains in eastern Ukraine have come at significant cost of manpower. According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised during talks between Ukrainian and US negotiators in Geneva. European representatives were also in the Swiss city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian <i id=\"de-facto\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">de facto </i>control<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i>but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in a video address late on Thursday that Ukrainian and US delegations would meet \"to translate the points we secured in Geneva into a form that puts us on the path to peace and security guarantees.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president did not mention any names, but his chief of staff Andriy Yermak had said US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was due to visit Kyiv later in the week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate. There was therefore \"no use\" signing any documents with them, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208wjpv4r9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset</a> and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere.

It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This part of the country is the heartland of the Shia Muslim community, and for decades has been under the sway of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political party. On streets, banners with the faces of fighters killed in battle hang from lamp-posts, celebrating them as \"martyrs of the resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I arrived in Froun an hour after the strike. Rescue workers had already removed the body parts of the only casualty - a man who was later described as a \"Hezbollah terrorist\" by the Israeli military. Despite a ceasefire deal that came into force last November, ending the latest war with Hezbollah, Israel has continued with its bombing, almost every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Who is going to help us?\" one resident, Mohamad Mokdad, asked me. The car had been hit as it passed in front of his house, and he was still cleaning up the veranda. \"There were body parts here and in the trees.\" He sounded despondent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're against all this... I just want to live in peace. I don't want parties,\" he said. He did not mention Hezbollah - which means \"Party of God\" - by name, but that is probably what he meant. \"I don't want anyone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah and the group's efforts to recover after being severely weakened in the war. I travelled to southern Lebanon to see the impact of the Israeli campaign, and saw that the attacks had shattered people's sense of security and even some long-held views in areas where Hezbollah has traditionally enjoyed widespread support.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8500/live/694820d0-cac8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man and woman sit on a tiled area outside a house, after dark.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Israeli attack in Froun happened outside Mohamad Mokdad's house</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ceasefire in Lebanon ended 13 months of war that killed 4,000 Lebanese and 120 Israelis. Israel and Hezbollah have been fighting for decades, and this conflict started when Hezbollah began firing rockets and missiles at Israeli positions a day after Israel launched its massive military response to the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The truce, brokered by the US and France, required Hezbollah to remove its fighters and weapons from the south of the Litani river, about 30km (20 miles) from the border with Israel, and Israeli troops to withdraw from areas of southern Lebanon that they invaded during the war. Thousands of Lebanese soldiers would then be sent to areas that had been effectively under Hezbollah control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, the Israeli military continues to occupy at least five hilltops in southern Lebanon and has carried out air and drone attacks across the country on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn81j54xjx1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Last Sunday, it killed the group's chief of staff and four others</a> in a strike on a building in the Dahieh district, outside Beirut.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon that operates south of the Litani, says Israel has committed more than 10,000 air and ground violations during the ceasefire. According to the Lebanese health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Israeli attacks, including civilians.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli officials say Hezbollah has been working to rebuild its military capabilities south of the Litani, which would be a violation of the ceasefire, and also tried to smuggle weapons into Lebanon while ramping up the production of explosive drones as an alternative to rockets and missiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, Israel has not made the evidence it says it has public. But, for weeks, Israeli journalists have been briefed on plans for a possible escalation against the group. \"Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,\" Israel Katz, the Israeli defence minister, said recently.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bceb/live/86c01b60-cadf-11f0-995e-fb191683181c.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC Destroyed buildings and piles of rubble are seen on a hillside in southern Lebanon.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lebanese communities along the border with Israel are still in ruins, and thousands of residents remain displaced</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joseph Aoun, the Lebanese president, came to power in January promising a \"state monopoly on arms\" - in other words, to disarm Hezbollah. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, Hezbollah is more than a militia.

Hezbollah, too, rejects the Israeli allegations and says the terms of the ceasefire deal only apply to south of the Litani. There, it has not opposed the Lebanese army's operations against its arsenal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has not fired on Israel since the truce came into force, although it did launch several mortars that hit an Israeli army base in the disputed Mount Dov/Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights in December, in response to what it said were repeated Israeli violations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8981/live/8ff36b90-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC Hands hold a mobile phone, on which can be seen a satellite image with red and blue dots marking locations.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The map, issued by a spokesperson for the Israeli military, showing locations that were allegedly being used by Hezbollah in the village of Beit Lif</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Lt Col Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli army, published on social media a warning for the Lebanese village of Beit Lif: Israel had detected \"dozens of terrorist infrastructures\" belonging to Hezbollah, and would act to remove any threat. Worried that an attack could be imminent, residents made a public appeal, late at night, for Lebanese soldiers to be deployed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I visited Beit Lif the following morning. (To travel to southern Lebanon, we had to inform Hezbollah's media office in Beirut; the group did not interfere in our reporting.) The village had a pre-war population of around 8,000; now, less than a third remains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local imam, a 63-year-old man who did not want to have his name published, told me the Lebanese soldiers had arrived with Unifil troops, patrolled the streets and left after about five hours, before dawn. The Lebanese military has refused to inspect private properties, possibly in order not to be seen to be collaborating with Israel; in Beit Lif too, the imam said, they did not enter any houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we spoke, half a dozen men gathered around us on the grounds of a mosque that had been destroyed in an Israeli air strike during the war. Quietly, one of them told me: \"Hezbollah needs to decide: it either responds to Israel or accepts defeat, disarms and let us move on with our lives. This can't continue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public criticism of Hezbollah is still rare but, exhausted, some appear to be questioning the old consensus. We then heard a distant sound – from Israeli fighter jets in the sky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the locations that appeared to have been highlighted in Col Adraee's  message was a house in front of the municipality building. Israel has frequently accused Hezbollah of embedding its arsenal in civilian areas, an allegation I had also heard from some residents during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ezzat Hammoud, the Beit Lif mayor, told me: \"No, no, no. There are no militants or weapons here. I can be held responsible for what I'm saying.\" So why, if that was the case, had his village attracted the attention of the Israeli military? \"Either to terrify the residents and force them to move,\" he said, \"or to put pressure on the Lebanese army to confront people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man is seen on a road, with a woman nearby, in front of a building which has a large image on the side.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Haider said his house had been marked by the Israeli military as a building being used by Hezbollah, which he denied</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A man called Haider, whose family owned the house, insisted on taking me to visit it.

He said the group would \"never\" surrender its weapons, which he called the \"source of its strength\". \"The enemy,\" Qassem said, referring to Israel and the United States, \"wants to erase our life and our existence, but we'll remain steadfast. We'll either live with dignity or die with dignity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hezbollah's arsenal, more powerful than that of the country's own army, has long divided the Lebanese. Opponents accuse Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into wars and of defending the interests of the group's main backer, Iran. They see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it. But President Aoun, who is a former army chief, has refused to use force against Hezbollah, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to a civil war. If the authorities were not careful, Aoun said in April, \"we'll lead Lebanon to ruin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Western diplomat familiar with the discussions told me the Lebanese authorities were under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, which was frustrated with the pace of the efforts and supported Israel's actions in Lebanon. \"Some are seeing this as the 'Lebanese way' of doing things,\" the diplomat said about the disarmament plans, and \"aren't convinced\" it can work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army is expected to announce it has completed the disarmament of the group in the areas south of the Litani next month. The army, an intelligence officer told me, would then turn its attention to other parts of the country - Hezbollah's presence is also significant in the Dahieh and the eastern Bekaa Valley. This will be a more challenging, and risky, mission without the group's consent, and there is no timeline for that.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man with a weathered face and grey hair looks into the camera.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nayef al-Rida is one of the few remaining residents in the border village of Yaroun, which was devastated during the war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I drove on to the border village of Yaroun.

That is when a leaked draft of a 28-point US plan to end the war first emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan, whose references to Ukraine giving up territory and limiting the size of its military led some to describe it as a \"Russian wish list\", caused consternation in Kyiv and sent European diplomats scrambling to limit the perceived damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some ways, it felt like a re-run of events in August, when anxious European leaders rushed to Washington to bend Trump's ear after the American president rolled out the red carpet to Putin in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the weekend, the Europeans had drafted a counter-proposal, also 28 points long, which replaced the blunt territorial concessions of the US plan with \"negotiations on territorial swaps\" and stiffened the language on security guarantees, a key concern of Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how much influence the Europeans had over Sunday's talks in Geneva remains unclear.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A joint US-Ukrainian statement, issued after the talks wrapped up, spoke of \"highly productive\" discussions, saying any future agreement must deliver a \"sustainable and just peace\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer was one of several European leaders who seized on the words \"sustainable and just\" as indicating that progress had been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials sounded relieved too. The First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the latest version of the plan had been slimmed down to just 19 points, with the most contentious issues – territory and Ukraine's future relations with Nato – put off for Trump and Zelensky to decide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid recriminations over how the original 28-point version had been leaked (with fingers pointing in multiple directions), a tight veil of secrecy has been drawn around the latest version.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite talks in Abu Dhabi involving the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll (a new addition to Trump's Ukraine team), Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and Russian officials, Ushakov says the plan has still not been discussed in detail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff due in Moscow next week and talk of Zelensky paying another visit to the White House, it seems the pace of diplomacy is not about to let up.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A white-haired man in blue jacket, white shirt and pink tie speaks and gestures  in an ornate office.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But where are we?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are now on a fast track to something,\" says Daniel Fried, former US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To a failure or a fast track to a success, I can't say, but it's moving fast.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ambassador Fried says last week's 28-point US plan was a \"hot mess\" but that the impetus behind it is real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To the Trump administration's credit, it's pushing hard for a settlement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sense of dread which settled over Kyiv last week - which caused Zelensky to observe that Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history – has lifted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Geneva, Ukraine's delegation was very satisfied,\" says Myroslava Gongadze, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, speaking from Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The point of the exercise was not exactly to make an agreement but to throw out that 28-point plan and put some Ukrainian interest in that possible negotiation and show that Ukraine is really willing to discuss and negotiate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if Kyiv feels it has successfully countered some of the worst of what was being demanded – and we still do not know how much – there are plenty of lingering concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief among them: what sort of security guarantees can it expect to receive if it finally strikes a deal with the country that launched an unprovoked invasion of its territory and still seems to covet more?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The essential question we must ask here is security guarantees,\" says Gongadze. \"Who will be giving those guarantees, who is being held accountable and which border would not be violated?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the answers are weak, then it's setting up Ukraine for another crisis.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters A middle-aged man in a blue jacket, white shirt and gold tie gesticulates in a room.  \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is in due in Moscow next week </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the original US document's rather vague promise to offer \"reliable security guarantees\", European leaders spoke of a US guarantee that \"mirrors Article 5\", a reference to Nato's principle of collective defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, the Axios news website reported the existence of a separate US paper, presented to Ukraine, which outlines \"security assurance modelled on the principles of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, adapted to the circumstances of this conflict\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This critical aspect of the plan is clearly still a work in progress. Following Tuesday's virtual meeting of the UK-French led Coalition of the Willing, participants agreed with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, to \"accelerate joint work with the United States to take forward the planning on security guarantees\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer says operational plans for a multinational \"reassurance force\" for Ukraine are fully formed but until the Trump administration indicates what, if any, backup it is willing to provide, those plans remain largely theoretical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Security guarantees are going to have to be fleshed out,\" says Ambassador Fried.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Coalition of the Willing is a great idea, but it hasn't landed on any result to date, partly because they are waiting to see whether the Americans will back them and partly because they're waiting to see what they're going into.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where we are on territory is another big unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week's 28-point plan stated, bluntly, that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be \"recognised as de facto Russian\", and that Ukrainian forces would withdraw from the heavily contested parts of the Donetsk region still under Kyiv's control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this language vanished in the European counter-proposal. Ukraine, it said, would commit \"not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means\". All territorial negotiations, it said, would \"start from the Line of Contact\" – the current front lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not known the extent to which Europe's approach informed the document that emerged after the talks in Geneva.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The joint US-Ukrainian communique offered only an oblique insight, saying the two sides \"reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The word \"fully\" appeared to be carrying a lot of weight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given Trump's mercurial approach to the war in Ukraine, Putin's lingering ambitions and Zelensky's domestic difficulties - the current round of diplomacy takes place in the midst of a corruption scandal that is undermining his domestic standing - it is extremely difficult to know where this process goes next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it might be overly optimistic to think we are near the end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're still in the middle of this process,\" says Leslie Shedd, another of the Atlantic Council's non-resident fellows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's certainly a long way to go still.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for all the apparent chaos surrounding the Trump administration's efforts, including a constantly shifting – and possibly competing – cast of characters, Shedd believes the administration is serious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It appears that the president… [is] truly prioritising finding a peace in Ukraine. And I think that is actually really important.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the leaked audio recording obtained and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">shared as a transcript by Bloomberg</a>, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were words that brought crowds out across Italy demanding change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two years on, MPs have voted for a law on femicide after a long and passionately debated session of parliament. It makes Italy one of very few places to categorise femicide as a distinct crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Introduced by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the law was backed by her own hard-right government as well as opposition MPs.

His wife was the only one in the family who didn't go to work or school on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chungs moved in a decade ago to Wang Cheong House – the first of the seven tower blocks at Tai Po to go up in flames. When the fire started, Mr Chung says, the smoke on the 23rd floor, where they lived, turned so thick within just 10 minutes, that his wife couldn't find her way out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cause of the fire is still unclear, but authorities believe renovations using flammable material and scaffolding helped spread what has now become the deadliest blaze in Hong Kong in six decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It engulfed seven of the eight buildings - comprising 1,800 units - in Wang Fuk Court, a subsidised housing estate built in 1983 to the north of Hong Kong Island, where the city's wealthy live. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 40% of Wang Fuk Court's residents are aged 65 or above, according to the 2021 census.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's partly why it's feared so many residents were trapped - because they are older and less likely to have made it out quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Fung, 40, has not been able to find her mother yet. She and her parents moved to the estate only last year - for its views of the ocean. Her father and she were at work when the fire started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Fung received a call from her neighbour, who said she was hiding with Ms Fung's mother inside a toilet.

But the vast country - bigger than France and Germany combined - also faces many other security challenges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent attempts by US President Donald Trump and his supporters to frame the insecurity purely as the persecution of Christians overlooks the complexity of Africa's most-populous nation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are criminal gangs in the north-west, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, clashes over land in central regions and separatist unrest in the south-east - leaving the 400,000-strong army and the police force of 370,000 officers overstretched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's a breakdown of the main armed groups and flashpoints:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Bandits'  - kidnap gangs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", are largely composed of people  from the Fulani ethnic group, who traditionally make their living by raising animals. They have traded their pastoral tools for assault rifles, which have flooded Nigeria - and other states in the region - since Libya descended into anarchy following the overthrow in 2011 of long-time strongman Muammar Gadaffi by Nato-backed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs are not known to be motivated by any religious or political ideology, but see kidnapping people for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money rather than walking for miles with their livestock in search of water and grazing land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They typically move in large numbers on motorcycles, which makes them highly mobile and allows them to strike quickly and escape before the security forces can respond - a tactic used during two recent school abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no centrally organised leadership - each gang, often drawn from one family or a specific community, tends to be loyal to its own leader. The police have placed bounties on some of the notable leaders, including Ado Aleru and Bello Turji, and in 2022 the government designated the bandits as \"terrorists\" in a bid to stem their violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aleru is from Yankuzo town - an area in the north-western state of Zamfara which has been a hub for bandit activity over the last three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs, which sometimes fight one another, also travel to neighbouring states and central regions to carry out kidnappings. They also prey on their local communities and are indiscriminate in their ransom demands. In some areas, they tax residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Younger bandits, some in their teens, are increasingly taking to TikTok to show off their ransom money, guns and motorcycles - and have garnered thousands of followers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Boko Haram - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Islamist militant group became infamous around the world in 2014 for kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok - around 90 of whom remain missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It evolved from a local Islamist sect founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri with the official name of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad and a political goal of creating an Islamic state. Local residents dubbed it Boko Haram - a name which in the Hausa language loosely translates as \"Western education is forbidden\" because of their opposition to Western-style schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its full-blown insurgency was triggered in 2009 by the killing of Yusuf who had been taken into police custody after Boko Haram clashed with the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At one point under its new leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram controlled large swathes of territory in Nigeria's north-east - and appointed \"emirs\" to administer some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chibok girls were only a small fraction of the many thousands of women and children taken into captivity and forced into sexual slavery, domestic servitude or used as suicide bombers by the militants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram then split into rival factions. After the death of Shekau four years ago, its strength has diminished, however it still conducts regular attacks on both civilians and security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram has spawned a range of groups that use kidnapping to raise funds, focusing on soft targets such as schools, churches, mosques and remote villages where paved roads and bridges are either inadequate or absent.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iswap - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Boko Haram commanders - including Abu Musab al-Barnawi, believed to be the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf - formed what became known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) in around 2016 as they felt Abubakar Shekau was violating Islamic doctrine by killing Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram routinely targeted markets and mosques, often with suicide bombers. Iswap generally avoids attacking Muslim civilians and focuses on military and government targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/west-africa/nigeria/b196-jas-vs-iswap-war-boko-haram-splinters\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Iswap is still locked in a violent turf war with Boko Haram</a>, with reports of deadly clashes between the two groups around Lake Chad earlier this month. In fact, Shekau is said to have killed himself during a battle with Iswap, exploding a suicide vest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains active and last week killed a Nigerian general, Brig Gen Musa Uba, after an ambush in Borno state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iswap commander Hussaini Ismaila was recently sentenced to 20 years in jail for multiple attacks in the northern city of Kano in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The north-eastern jihadist group was initially blamed for an attack on a Catholic church in the south-west of the country in June 2022 that killed at least 50 worshippers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors now believe it was a single cell linked to Somalia's al-Shabab jihadist group that was responsible. Five men are currently on trial for the attack and it is alleged they went to Somalia for training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind the two recent school kidnappings in the north-west of Nigeria in Kebbi and Niger states, but the government believes that Boko Haram and Iswap are behind them, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is a claim disputed by some experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits,\" conflict analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ansaru - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This splinter group has moved away from the north-east, where Boko Haram and Iswap dominate, to carry out its operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have participated in the 2022 attack on a high-speed train travelling between the capital, Abuja - in the centre of the country - and the city of Kaduna, about 200km (124 miles) north, in which at least seven people were killed and more than 100 commuters were abducted for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, Khalid al-Barnawi, was arrested in 2016 and is facing trial over several attacks, including the 2011 bombing of the UN building in Abuja.

In April, its fighters killed several vigilantes and attacked a market there, killing Fulani men and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their recent focus has shifted slightly north of Kwara - to Niger and Kebbi states - areas long plagued by bandit violence, where the two recent school abductions occurred.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lakurawa - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A relatively new Islamist militant group, Lakurawa has been attacking communities in Sokoto and Kebbi states in the north-west and in Niger, the country which borders Nigeria to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say it maintains ties with jihadist networks in Mali and Niger, and members have settled among border communities, marrying locally and recruiting young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially presenting itself as a protector against the bandits that roam the north-west, the group has gradually imposed harsh controls - such as checking villagers' phones for music, which is banned as it is considered un-Islamic, and flogging offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was declared a terrorist organisation in 2025 and accused of cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacking top government officials.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">JNIM - Sahel jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Active mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso, where it controls large areas, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), may be making inroads into Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A confirmed JNIM attack in northern Benin early in 2025 occurred close to the Nigerian border. In October 2025, the group claimed what would be its first attack inside Nigeria, in Kwara - the same state where more than 30 worshippers were abducted from a church last week and which has also seen increasing incursions by bandits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If JNIM activities are confirmed, it would complicate an already dire situation in parts of the country where Ansaru, Lakurawa, Mahmuda and the bandits are all active.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Herders v farmers - battles over resources</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This long-running conflict in central Nigeria - also known as the Middle Belt - has devastated communities, fuelling displacement and the spread of small arms as both herders and farmers arm themselves for what has become a deadly cycle of reprisal attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been framed by some as a religious fight, but the central grievance is over grazing rights - access to land and water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The herders are mainly Fulani Muslims, while the farmers are largely Christians from various ethnic communities, although some are Muslim. Fulani families traditionally walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find land for their prized cattle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But urbanisation has seen encroachment onto these age-old grazing routes and locals accuse the Fulani of letting their cattle trample their crops and forcing them out of their homes and fields.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notable clashes have taken place in Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states. In order to try and curb the violence, some state governments have imposed anti-open grazing laws and set up ranches for the herders - but have faced resistance from all sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fallout from the conflict is the establishment of ethnic militias that, in some cases, have turned to criminality, plundering the people they ostensibly claim to be protecting. Ethnic Tiv militias in Benue have been accused carrying out mass killings and some of their leaders have been killed or arrested by the security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ipob - separatist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The separatist violence in the south-east has its roots in calls for Biafran independence that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51094093\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">date back nearly 60 years to the brutal civil war that led to the deaths of up to a million people</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rebellion was crushed but demands for an independent state for the Igbo people of the region continued as some Igbos continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), led by Nnamdi Kanu, is one of the groups promoting that call for secession. In 2009 Kanu launched Radio Biafra that broadcast separatist messages to Nigeria from London. Ipob was designated as terrorist organisation in 2017 - and three years later Kanu created an armed wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Eastern Security Network (ESN), as it was called, and other splinter groups have since been implicated in arson, kidnappings and killings of civilians and security personnel in five states across the south-east.

were shot at close range near Farragut Square in downtown Washington DC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The soldiers had been on a high-visibility patrol near the corner of 17th and I streets, an area where many office workers mill around at lunchtime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Metropolitan Police Assistant Chief Jeff Carroll said the suspect \"came around the corner\" and

Mr Jiménez's workshop on the main provincial road is there to help any that need new tyres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Añelo is located in the heart of Vaca Muerta, a 30,000 sq km (12,000 sq mi) oil and gas-rich geological formation. It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Matías Zibell García Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez leaning on tyres at his garage\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Matías Zibell García</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Business has boomed for mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This accounts \"for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Añelo's size and population has soared over the past decade</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won't be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Roads in and around Añelo are now busy with traffic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

Substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cardboard, debris and paint thinner is also often found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong, although reports said these were caused by falls and other safety failures, rather than fires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were \"relatively old\" - they were built in the 1980s - so \"the glass windows are not that fire resilient\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane...

The BBC visited one such facility in Noida, near Delhi, on a weekday morning a few days back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a packed waiting hall outside the doctor's consulting room, anxious parents stood in line with children sneezing, coughing or complaining of breathing difficulties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most started falling ill in October, when the capital's air quality dipped to hazardous levels and waiting times for doctor's appointment had stretched longer than usual.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toxic air is a recurring problem in Delhi and across parts of northern India during the winter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There isn't a single cause behind the problem, but a mix of factors like low wind speeds, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, dropping temperatures and the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the last month, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) - which measures different types of pollutants, including the level of fine particulate matter PM2.5 that can clog lungs - has been hovering between 300 and 400. This is more than 20 times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Readings above 400 affect all healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, but high exposure to PM2.5 hits children and the elderly the hardest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the capital, many hospitals have seen an influx of children who are sick because of the unbreathable air.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These particles can affect the child's immunity, especially because their system is still developing and the cells are learning an immune response in the early years,\" Dr Shishir Bhatnagar, the paediatrician at the Noida clinic, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These cases have increased tenfold in recent years.

This year, it even tried cloud seeding to trigger artificial rain, without success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But none of it has helped ease the pollution crisis that sparks anxiety among the city's 20 million people - particularly among parents of young children. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images A child on a railway platform through dense smog as the temperature drops in Lucknow, India, on 23 January, 2024.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">High exposure to PM2.5 - or fine particulate matter - hits children the hardest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khushboo Bharti, 31, says she shudders every time she remembers the night of 13 November, when she had to rush her one-year-old daughter Samaira to the emergency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember her waking up with a violent cough that made her vomit several times,\" Ms Bharti says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She tried the usual home remedies, but nothing worked.

And the toxic air outdoor makes things worse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These children are consistently exposed to high degrees of pollution so their lung defence systems are reduced. If you fail to treat such childhood infections, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs,\" says Dr Fathahudeen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He points out that several studies show how early childhood infections caused by the exposure of \"immature lungs\" to air pollution can lead to chronic obstructive airway disease in adulthood, similar to what's seen among smokers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Fathahudeen says those who can should strictly keep their children indoors and make sure they are properly hydrated and wear N95 masks - which filter out 95% of the pollutants - when outdoors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But parents question how long can they keep children shut indoors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're growing, they need space to play and while they do get brief moments in nature, we are now forced to stop them,\" said Seema*, a mother. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They protest sometimes, but what choice do we have?
