Cambodia has yet to confirm whether it suffered any casualties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both sides exchanged gunfire early on Thursday, with each claiming the other had triggered the conflict. It escalated quickly, with Thailand accusing Cambodia of firing rockets and Bangkok carrying out air strikes on Cambodian military targets.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand has closed its border with Cambodia, while Cambodia has downgraded its ties with Thailand, accusing its military of using \"excessive force\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both countries have asked their citizens near the border to leave the areas, with Thailand evacuating 40,000 civilians to safer locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[The fighting] is really serious. We're in the middle of evacuating,\" Sutian Phiwchan, a local resident of Ban Dan district in Thailand's Buriram province near the Cambodian border, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thai authorities said that a total of 11 civilians - including an eight-year-old and a 15-year-old - as well as one military personnel have been killed in the Surin, Ubon Ratchathani and Srisaket provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand claims that it began with Cambodia's military deploying drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia says Thai soldiers initiated the conflict when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The dispute dates back to more than a hundred years ago, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Things officially became hostile in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register an 11th Century temple located in the disputed area as a Unesco World Heritage Site - a move that was met with heated protest from Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were sporadic clashes over the years which saw soldiers and civilians killed on both sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on one another. Cambodia banned imports from Thailand such as fruits and vegetables, and stopped importing power and internet services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both countries have also strengthened troop presence along the border in recent weeks.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand's acting premier Phumtham Wechayachai said that its dispute with Cambodia remains \"delicate\", and must be addressed with care and in line with international law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said his country wants to resolve the dispute peacefully - adding, however, that it has \"no choice\" but to \"respond with armed force against armed aggression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Serious exchanges of fire between the two countries have de-escalated relatively quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while it appears the current fighting is unlikely to blow up into a full-scale war, both countries currently lack leadership with enough strength and confidence to pull back from this confrontation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hun Manet, the son of a former strongman, does not yet have his own authority - and Hun Sen, his father, appears willing to push this conflict further in order to burnish his own nationalist credentials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Thailand, there is a shaky coalition government backed by another former strongman, Thaksin Shinawatra. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thaksin believed he had a close personal relationship with Hun Sen and his family, and feels betrayed by Hun Sen's decision to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vrrj72xy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">leak a private conversation</a> which led to his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, being suspended as prime minister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-may-titthara-in-phnom-penh.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by May Titthara in Phnom Penh.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It noted that appearing in the documents was not a sign of any wrongdoing by Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response, a White House spokesman called it a \"fake news story\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Trump administration has been under mounting pressure to disclose more information about Epstein - with whom Trump was friendly before, according to the president, they fell out in 2004.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump had promised to release such files about the well-connected sex offender. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But his supporters have since grown frustrated with the administration's handling of the issue, including its failure to deliver a rumoured \"client list\" of Epstein. In a memo earlier this month, the justice department and FBI said there was no such list.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 as he awaited his trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. His death was ruled a suicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His crimes, and the nature of his death, have long been the subject of conspiracy theories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Separately on Wednesday, a US judge in Florida denied the justice department's bid to unseal court files on Epstein that relate to his prosecution there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later that same day, a sub-committee of the US House of Representatives voted to subpoena the justice department for its files.

It escalated quickly, with Thailand accusing Cambodia of firing rockets and Bangkok carrying out air strikes on Cambodian military targets.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand has closed its border with Cambodia, while Cambodia has downgraded its ties with Thailand, accusing its military of using \"excessive force\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both countries have asked their citizens near the border to leave the areas, with Thailand evacuating 40,000 civilians to safer locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[The fighting] is really serious. We're in the middle of evacuating,\" Sutian Phiwchan, a local resident of Ban Dan district in Thailand's Buriram province near the Cambodian border, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thai authorities said that a total of 11 civilians - including an eight-year-old and a 15-year-old - as well as one military personnel have been killed in the Surin, Ubon Ratchathani and Srisaket provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand claims that it began with Cambodia's military deploying drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia says Thai soldiers initiated the conflict when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The dispute dates back to more than a hundred years ago, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Things officially became hostile in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register an 11th Century temple located in the disputed area as a Unesco World Heritage Site - a move that was met with heated protest from Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were sporadic clashes over the years which saw soldiers and civilians killed on both sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on one another.

Several waved placards that read \"shame\", \"12414 [the new law] sounds like 1984\", and \"Parliament is full of parasites\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The activists see the move as a return to the corruption of a decade ago when Ukraine was ruled by pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The gatherings constitute the largest anti-government demonstrations since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fight against corruption is seen as closely tied to Kyiv's prospects for integration within the EU – a path that started in 2014, when anti-government protests ousted Yanukovych in favour of closer ties with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The creation of Nabu and Sap was one of the requirements set by the European Commission and International Monetary Fund more than a decade ago in order to move towards a relaxation of visa restrictions between Ukraine and the EU. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2022, Kyiv was granted the coveted status of EU candidate – a significant development that boosted spirits and strengthened ties between Ukraine and its European backers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, there is concern Zelensky's move may undermine Kyiv's growing proximity to the West – a cause for which many Ukrainians feel their country continues to pay the price of the Russian onslaught. \"Corruption lives – the future dies,\" one placard at the Kyiv protest read.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Von der Leyen's spokesman reiterated that respect for the rule of law and the fight against corruption were \"core elements\" of EU membership - and that as a candidate country, Ukraine was expected to uphold those standards. \"There cannot be a compromise,\" he added.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/006c/live/12149550-67d1-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Young Ukrainians in Kyiv hold placards, including a young woman with a white T-shirt and a blue sash\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Ukrainians turned out in big numbers - with placards calling on Zelensky to \"veto\" the bill</figcaption></p></figure><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Corruption in Ukraine is endemic and the country currently ranks 105 out of 180 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. The rating may be low - but it nonetheless marks an improvement of 39 points since Nabu and Sap were created in 2014.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then the two bodies have been involved in far-reaching investigations into the misappropriation of millions of dollars' worth of assets and bribes across various ministries and sectors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2023 a joint investigation resulted in the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-65610985\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">arrest of the head of Ukraine's Supreme Court</a>, Vsevolod Kniaziev, in connection with a $3m (£2.4m; €2.9m) bribe. Earlier this month, it also emerged Nabu was conducting searches at the residence of former defence minister Oleksii Reznikov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now Nabu and Sap will have to operate under presidential oversight, leading some to wonder whether high-profile figures close to the government will eschew scrutiny. By curtailing the bodies' independence the government had \"destroyed everything that has been worked on for years,\" one protester in Kyiv told Radio Liberty.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite a nationwide ban on mass gatherings under martial law, more protests were expected in an even greater number of cities across Ukraine on Wednesday evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The \"scandalous\" new law \"dealt a critical blow to Ukraine's European integration process,\" the Ukrainska Pravda website said, while another outlet, Dzerkalo Tyzhnia, warned that Zelensky had taken a \"step towards authoritarianism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prominent war veteran Masi Nayem told his 54,000 Facebook followers that he had joined the protests in Kyiv as a \"duty\" to the victims of Russia's war. \"I fought for the nation, for the people and the democratic system,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">European allies have also sounded alarm bells. The legislation \"hampered Ukraine's way towards the EU,\" said Germany's foreign minister Johann Wadephul, and France's European affairs minister Benjamin Haddad urged Kyiv to reverse its decision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a joint statement on Wednesday the Nabu and Sap said they had been deprived of the guarantees that allowed them to combat corruption effectively. They also thanked Ukrainians for their \"principled position, active support and concern\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wednesday saw the beginning of the third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul.

Two other roommates were not physically injured. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Authorities worked for more than six weeks to catch him, using a DNA sample from a knife sheath he left at the scene of the crime as well as phone records and surveillance footage of his white car. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Eventually, Kohberger - who officials say visited the students' Moscow residence several times before the murders - was arrested at his family home in Pennsylvania on 30 December. He also received a sentence of 10 years for burglary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, when asked by the judge if he wished to speak, he replied: \"I respectfully decline.\" He had <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2zvzm9v9jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">pleaded guilty in deal to avoid the death penalty.</a> </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Relatives of the four university students spoke for over two hours at the hearing, sharing the trauma Kohberger had inflicted on their lives. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The family members offered memories of their lost loved ones, describing the four students as bright and empathetic. Their descriptions left many in the court in tears, including the judge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Madison Mogen was someone who listened carefully to others, her step-father, Scott Laramie, told the court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Karen and I are ordinary people, but we lived extraordinary lives because we had Maddy,\" he said of him and his wife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kristi Goncalves, the mother of Kaylee, told Kohberger he had stolen her peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You've altered my every waking moment,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some took the chance to express their fury with Kohberger, including Kaylee Goncalves' sister, Alivea, who told the defendant to \"sit up straight\" while she talked to him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You're a textbook case of insecurity. You are not profound, you're pathetic,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You're going to go to hell,\" said Xana Kernodle's step father, Randy Davis. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Aunt of murdered Idaho student says she has \"forgiven\" killer</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But one woman, an aunt of Kernodle, told Kohberger she forgave him, and that she wanted answers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Any time you want to talk, I'm here for you,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court also heard statements from two of the students' roommates who were sleeping in the house the night of the murders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the roommates, Dylan Mortensen, saw the assailant in a ski mask in the hallway as he was leaving. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sobbing as she spoke, Ms Mortensen told the court she had not been able to sleep since the murders, too afraid to close her eyes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People call me strong, they call me a survivor but don't see what my new reality looks like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He didn't just take their lives, he took the light they carried into every room,\" she said of her four friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Kohberger declining to speak, the three-hour long sentencing hearing did not provide the answers that some relatives and members of the public had long been hoping for. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/58fe/live/ba404590-67f8-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters Dylan Mortensen cries into the shoulder of another woman who is also crying\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Dylan Mortensen told the court she will continue living with the pain, but Kohberger will stay there \"empty, forgotten and powerless\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many questions remain surrounding the case - including why Kohberger, a criminology doctorate student at Washington State University, would drive to another campus a state over to brutally stab four students.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the sentence, investigators told the media despite using \"every resource possible\", they did not discover a single connection between Kohberger and his victims, or surviving roommates.

He is holding up the booklet containing the order.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan is a big deal for President Donald Trump's upheaval of the world's trading system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On his own terms, it could now be said that his aggressive approach is yielding tangible results.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Right from the off, the US side has been talking up the chances of a deal with Japan, but despite several delegations, the deal had been strangely elusive - until now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a narrow sense, this is a win for the Trump approach, especially if Japan becomes the domino that leads the rest of the world to come into line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan now has the best deal, or rather, the least worst deal, of all the nations with major trade surpluses with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The general tariff of 15% to be charged on Japanese goods being imported to the US is higher than the UK's 10%, but the UK has no surplus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As I've reported before, the fury of the Japanese negotiators during talks was noted among Washington DC diplomats accustomed to the nation's extreme politeness. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tokyo was playing hardball. The Japanese finance minister described the nation's $1.1 trillion holding of US Treasury bonds, the largest in the world, as a \"card\" that could be put on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was rumours about hedge funds in Japan dumping US bonds following Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement in April that sparked a wider sell-off, and bigger questions over the world's biggest economy and safe haven status of the US dollar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So the reaching of a deal matters hugely, in and of itself, and as an example to other major economic blocs, including the European Union (EU).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The deal comes on the day the Japanese host EU leaders in Tokyo. There had been some chatter about Japan, the EU and Canada coordinating their retaliation. This stops any such initiative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some members of the EU will wonder why a similar deal cannot be struck, at the very moment that Germany and France up the ante on retaliation, perhaps against the US tech giants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The world awaits the details here, but it is clear that Japan has protected its agricultural imports, though will import more US rice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is unclear what can change the lack of popularity of large American cars in the country, though Japanese private companies will be backed to invest half a trillion dollars in the US, in some form.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan has done this deal when it might have waited out to see how things develop and international markets react when Trump's tougher tariffs for a host of countries come into force on 1 August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The domestic political weakness of its Prime Minister may have been a factor, though other countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines have also done deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The big picture though is a weary acceptance of the US levying what would have been a year ago unthinkable tariffs on its major allies, for fear of something worse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Japan's case it was a 25% tariff threatened by Trump. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Tariff revenue rising for the US</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tariffs are now raising significant sums for the US Treasury, without retaliation against US exporters. At over $100bn so far this year, about 5% of US federal revenue is coming from tariffs, versus 2% more typically. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent thinks that the annual tariff take will be $300bn. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is way off the amount raised by income taxes, but a notable amount. It is being taken without direct retaliation and without right now the market turmoil seen earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the story does not end here. Who is actually paying these tariffs? Ultimately US consumers will pay a large part in terms of the prices they pay for imported goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past Bessent and others have suggested that a rising value of the US dollar would help mitigate the cost of imports for consumers. The opposite has happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The dollar has slumped in the first half of this year, losing 10% of its value against a basket of world currencies. This will add to the cost of imports, in addition to the tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a wider canvas here too. The governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey said this week that \"the most crowded trade in the market at the moment is 'short dollar'\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that established safe haven patterns in markets, especially the US dollar, were \"essentially breaking down\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a \"reduction of exposure\" to the dollar as companies and traders now take out trades or \"hedges\" designed to ensure they are protected against its decline,\" the governor said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As I've discussed before, there is suspicion in the markets that this weaker dollar may actually have been part of the point of these interventions, designed to help boost, for example, American rust-belt manufacturers regain competitiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On top of that, the US has also helped its great rival China to at least make a case to the rest of the world, that it can be a more stable trade partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For this first stage of the great global trade war, Japan is an important win for the White House, which will push back against the suggestion that \"Trump always chickens out\" or TACO. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While it could also translate into more apparent wins ahead of next week's deadlines, driving further market euphoria, the broader economic picture remains far murkier.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Readers in the UK can <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zgmn46f\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">sign up here</a>.

BBC visits remote Australian reef to find out</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Australia boasts plenty of superlatives when it comes to its natural landmarks. The Great Barrier Reef, the world's biggest coral reef system on the north-east coast, is rightly recognised as a Unesco World Heritage Site. Buzzing with biodiversity, it's a diver's dream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there's a lesser-known record breaker on the other side of the country, on Australia's north-western coast: Ningaloo Reef.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A 14-hour drive north of Perth, Ningaloo is unique. The world's largest fringing reef and another of Australia's Unesco World Heritage Sites, it is home to a lush oceanic forest that spreads out along the coast for hundreds of kilometres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From the region's remote desert beaches, you can wade into vibrant turquoise waters and almost immediately start snorkelling in a seascape as famous for its vibrant corals as the wildlife that surrounds them - manta rays, reef sharks and whale sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this year, Ningaloo has found itself in trouble. Hit by a marine heatwave, higher water temperatures have stressed the corals and they've been turning white, in an effect known as 'bleaching'. While some may recover, it's not a given – and the damage has astounded scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only that, but the heatwave is responsible for another, more worrying  superlative. This is the first time that the reefs on both Australia's western and eastern coasts have been bleached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's like a raging underwater bushfire that has persisted for months now, wreaking harm right along the coast,\" says Paul Gamblin, who heads up the Australian Marine Conservation Society. \"It's an absolutely devastating event and people are reeling from it. It is enormous. It's unprecedented. It's absolutely not normal.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/abb3/live/0b502f40-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A school of suckerfish, sharksuckers and cobia follow a Whale Shark on Ningaloo Reef\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What's going on?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The marine heatwave that's damaging Ningaloo started in the Caribbean in 2023 . It then made its way across the Indo-Pacific, damaging coral reefs in its path. In 2024, while the Great Barrier Reef saw bleaching,  Ningaloo was spared. But by the end of last year and the beginning of 2025 – peak summer – temperatures had begun to soar in Western Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's all part of the fourth global bleaching event, which experts say has affected more than 80% of the world's coral reefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Kate Quigley, principal research scientist at Minderoo Foundation, likens the effect to a stomach bug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Instead of having bacteria in the human gut, corals have this little algal symbiont that lives inside their cells that allow them to do biological processes,\" she explains, adding that this algae is what gives the corals their colour. When water becomes too warm, that relationship breaks down and bleaching begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So, kind of like, if we got a stomach bug and the human body doesn't function the same way, [it's the] same thing with the coral,\" she explains. \"The warm water causes the biological processes inside that coral to go haywire. And just like humans get sick, corals get sick too.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Of particular worry to Dr Quigley is the prolonged warming scientists have seen. They expected temperatures to drop by April as peak summer passed. This year, that didn't happen.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5789/live/6a932530-65f0-11f0-b5f1-33588113b421.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An arid coastline seen from the air, with turquoise sea waters and dark patches of reef\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Ningaloo is the world's largest fringing reef, home to an oceanic forest that spreads hundreds of kilometres along the coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In previous warming events, water temperatures might have increased for a bit of time and then gone back down again so the corals can essentially recover - they can bounce back,\" explains Dr Quigley. \"But what we're really afraid of seeing, especially in the coming months, is really high levels of death.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While government scientists have been monitoring the reef, there's still a lot they don't know.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The natural world is an incredibly variable place, and sometimes we're... shocked by what we see, [because] it doesn't seem to follow the rules,\" says Dr Tom Holmes, the Marine Science Programme Leader at the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions in Western Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Holmes and his team are doing follow-up surveys between three and six months after the bleaching to assess how many corals have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There are certainly records of corals [being] in a bleached state for that period of time and still surviving,\" he says. \"So we just need to play the waiting game now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ningaloo attracts around 200,000 tourists to its waters each year. For swimmers and divers, though, the damage is clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was like snorkelling on a corpse,\" says British-South African tourist Jenna-Rae Clark, who has been up and down the coastline of Ningaloo in recent weeks. \"It was so grey and lifeless. You can sometimes hear fish munching on the coral - there was nothing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For residents, there's an additional fear: that tourists will turn their back on Ningaloo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People have been really devastated off the back of summer, and a lot of people are talking about how they were crying in the water, coming out of the ocean just really upset,\" says Sara Morgillo, who moved here from Perth to dive and work in conservation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's still amazing parts of the reef here that are worth seeing and we're still running dive tours every day,\"  she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think it's also really important to witness what's happening and [see] the effects of the marine heat wave that we've had.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why is this happening?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Scientists are all in agreement about what's causing this heatwave: rising carbon emissions are heating up the planet and its oceans. According to Nasa, the ocean is where 90% of global warming is happening – and the last decade was its warmest since the 1800s. Last year was its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/ocean-warming/?intent=121\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">warmest on record</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These more worrying superlatives are threatening Australia's famous landmarks. But there's another, more home-grown problem too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just up the coast from Ningaloo is one of the world's largest fossil fuel projects, the North West Shelf gas plant. In May, the Australian government announced it would allow Woodside, the company which runs the project, to keep it operating until 2070.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The same company is also trying to get approval to develop Australia's biggest untapped gas reserves in the Browse Basin, further up the coast.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e5cd/live/36689820-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A red rock shelf in the foreground with an industrial site in the background, including a flaming gas tower\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Huge fossil fuel projects are continuing with government approval in Australia - despite record levels of global warming</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While these projects alone don't create the heat that's damaging Ningaloo, it's a symbol of the competing interests in Western Australia – where the gas industry fuels the economy far more than tourism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo are sources of deep wonder, the equivalent of Antarctica or the Serengeti or the Amazon,\" says the Australian Marine Conservation Society's Paul Gamblin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The juxtaposition is incomprehensible: at a time when places like Ningaloo are clearly suffering the consequences of climate change, for government even to contemplate opening up new fossil fuel projects...

That way they can better track their health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People ask me, what can we do? Well, the first thing you can do is choose politicians that are considering reducing fossil fuels and are [supportive of] renewable energies,\" says Dr Roelfsema. \"Your vote has a voice for politicians, so you can choose that. But you can also drive less, [use] public transport, not have your air conditioning on all the time - these are all things that can help reduce our footprint.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There's also science being done in the lab. Dr Quigley and her team at Minderoo have been selectively breeding combinations of corals to find out which types are the most tolerant to higher temperatures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have these fertilized eggs from many, many different genetic backgrounds and we raise them over a series of days until we have coral babies, coral teenagers,\" she explains. \"Just like butterflies, corals also undergo different metamorphoses and stages.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By testing those corals, researchers can assess which ones are more tolerant to higher temperatures. Then the idea is to place them back in the water.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c29d/live/4199e3c0-6759-11f0-a885-47a260cd1e9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A sea turtle swimming in the sea, seen from above\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Scientists have compared the Great Barrier Reef and Ningaloo to the Amazon and the Serengeti</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Dr Quigley has done this in the Great Barrier Reef, it's at a much earlier stage here in Ningaloo - and she admits that the method is not ideal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It would be very hard to scale for all reefs around the world,\" she concedes. \"It would make much more sense to get at the root cause, which is emissions, for that long-term livelihood of coral reefs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Viewed by critics as merely a sticking plaster, there's pressure for authorities to do more. That brings Dr Quigley back to the bushfire analogy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Interestingly, when bushfires happen here in Australia, the authorities are on it very quickly – there's a lot of response,\" she says. \"You don't see that on the coral reefs in Australia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One reason may be because it's corals at risk, not people. After all, there are no houses in the path of the underwater bushfire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Experts, however, say such a view is shortsighted.

From this facility – thought to be the largest of its kind in private hands nationwide – the 38-year-old has sold cubs and breeding pairs for the last 10 years. He is widely considered to be one of the biggest lion dealers in Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades these animals – lions, tigers, pumas, cheetahs and jaguars – have been a sign of power, status and even political fealty in the country. The tiger, for example, is a symbol of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More recently, with the dawn of short video social media apps like TikTok and Instagram, there's been a surge in ownership, with lions now sometimes even brought along to wedding events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the wake of a pet lion escaping and attacking a woman and her two children as they walked down the street in Lahore, the government has launched a crackdown – one which is already impacting people like Fayyaz.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among the new rules, owners must pay a one-time registration fee of 50,000 Pakistani rupees ($176; £129) per animal and farms are to keep a maximum of 10  big cats from no more than two species. The sites must also be open to the public for visits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Violating new laws could result in a fine of up to 200,000 Pakistani rupees and, for the worst offenders, up to seven years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another property on the outskirts of Lahore, five lion cubs – their coats muddied – pace around a cage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But where are the parents?\" a wildlife official asks himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearby, there are several empty cages. Wildlife officials are here after receiving a tip-off that a man was holding lions and cubs without a licence, and was breeding them for sale illegally. By the time they arrived, the owner was missing, leaving his caretaker holding the bag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I was only hired two weeks ago,\" he complains, as he was placed in the back of a truck and taken away for questioning.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The rescued cubs are being isolated for medical checks at Lahore's \"Safari Zoo\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The officials suspect the owner may have taken the cubs' parents away and hidden them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rescued cubs have now been transferred to a public zoo in Lahore, and isolated for medical checks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in a country where big cats have been sold for decades, officials worry the raids are barely scratching the surface. They believe there are in fact hundreds, if not thousands, of undeclared big cats in the state of Punjab alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is going to take at least six months,\" Mubeen Ellahi, the director general of Wildlife &amp; Parks, tells the BBC. He expects 30-40% of the lions in Punjab will not be voluntarily declared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is also another complication. Mubeen explains inbreeding has become a common practice in Pakistan, and some big cats may have to be euthanised. \"They have a lot of health problems.

In addition to metals and lumber, Canada exports large quantities of oil, cars and car parts, other machinery, food and pharmaceuticals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Office of the US Trade Representative, in 2024 the US exported nearly $350bn (£258bn) in goods to Canada, and imported more than $412bn from its northern neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has announced a large array of tariffs both on specific product categories and countries, alleging that the US has been treated unfairly by its foreign trading partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has also given other justifications for the tariffs, including that he is trying to exert pressure on his neighbours to curb illegal shipments of fentanyl into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to data from the US Customs and Border Patrol, about 0.2% of all seizures of fentanyl coming into the US occur at the border with Canada, with almost all of the rest confiscated at the border with Mexico.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since unleashing a global programme of tariffs, Trump has announced a handful of deals - including with the UK, Japan and Indonesia - but those agreements have kept in place some higher tariff rates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Tuesday, for instance, the White House announced a deal with the Philippines including a 19% tariff on goods from the country – up from a 17% rate initially announced, but lower than a 20% tariff Trump threatened in a letter earlier this month.</p></div></div></body></html>"

findings that Russia had failed in probing attempts to hack US election databases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A declassified copy of the president's daily briefing prepared by US security service chiefs for Obama weeks after Trump beat Clinton and dated 8 December 2016 said: \"We assess that Russian and criminal actors did not impact recent US election results by conducting malicious cyber activities against election infrastructure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the FBI dissented from the findings it had initially co-authored, and a meeting was held at the White House a day later with top officials, according to the report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Afterwards an aide to then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper emailed intelligence chiefs asking them to create a new assessment \"per the president's request\" detailing the \"tools Moscow used and actions it took to influence the 2016 election\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gabbard argued the emails showed evidence of a  \"treasonous conspiracy\" to harm Trump, and she threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the justice department for prosecution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Obama's spokesman said in his statement on Tuesday: \"Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US intelligence community published an assessment in January 2017 concluding that Russia had sought to damage Clinton's campaign and boost Trump in the vote three months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US officials found this effort had included Russian bot farms on social media and hacking of Democratic emails, but they ultimately concluded the impact was probably limited and did not actually change the election result.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A 2020 bipartisan report by the Senate intelligence committee also found that Russia had tried to help Trump's 2016 campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was a senator at the time, was among the Republicans who co-signed that report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The first two years of Trump's first presidency were overshadowed by an investigation from his own justice department into whether he had conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The resulting Mueller report found a lack of evidence that Trump or his campaign co-ordinated with the Kremlin, and no-one was ever charged with such crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A subsequent special counsel inquiry, the Durham report, found the original FBI probe had lacked \"analytical rigor\" and relied on \"raw, unanalysed

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Typhoon Wipha, known locally as Crising, is the third storm the Philippines has seen this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to tropical cyclones, due to its location on the Pacific Ocean where such weather systems form. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About 20 tropical cyclones form in that region every year, half of which impact the country directly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Six people have been reportedly killed since the rains started last weekend, while tens of thousands have been displaced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And there appears to be no respite from the stormy weather as two more cyclones are predicted to develop or enter the Philippines later this month. Historically, the strongest and deadliest storms hit towards the end of the year, just before Christmas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The deluge comes days ahead of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's annual State of the Nation Address to Congress next Monday, which will be closely watched for his plans to address the perennial flooding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During the height of torrential rains earlier this week, Marcos suspended preparations for his speech after photos of government personnel putting up his portraits on Manila lamp posts went viral and stoked anger online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Critics said government resources should be focused on disaster response, rather than preparations for a political spectacle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Marcos, who is in Washington to negotiate a trade deal with US President Donald Trump, said he had ensured the preparedness of disaster response agencies before he left the country.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why do floods keep happening?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Much of the flooding has been concentrated in Metro Manila, which is home to more than 13 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is one of the world's most densely populated mega cities and its rubbish disposal is a major challenge. Uncollected and improperly disposed waste pollutes waterways and clogs drain systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The floods are caused by Metro Manila's \"very old\" and \"inadequate\" sewage system, according to Manuel Bonoan, Marcos' public works minister. It dates back to the early 1900s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The system is also 70% silted or clogged after over a century of use, Mr Bonoan told news outlet ABS-CBN News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Mahar Lagmay, a geologist at the University of the Philippines and an expert in disaster response, said on social media that the floods were in part caused by roads built over natural waterways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Solving the flood problem would need to take into account several factors, including the tides on Manila Bay, potential storm surges, and the possible failure of nearby dams, Dr Lagmay said in an earlier opinion piece.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Houses collapse into Philippines storm surge water</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr Bonoan says a master plan to tackle the floods is being put together with help from the World Bank, adding that Manila has allocated billions of pesos to the problem. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One immediate solution involves repairing 32 water pumping stations in the capital to reduce the strain on the drainage system, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to sit down once and for all, at the soonest possible time, to find a solution,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The newly wed Mr Verdillo thinks it is a problem that can one day be solved, so couples no longer have to wade through waters to get to the altar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have seas and rivers here in the Philippines, so we have so much water. The government should invest in flood gates, pumping stations and wider canals,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Improvements cannot be done in a day, but could be done in years...

The new rates, while lower than those proposed in April, have done little to allay anxieties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among nations that received letters from Donald Trump were apparel hubs like Cambodia and Sri Lanka, which are heavily dependent on the US as an export market. The letters said that the two nations would face tariffs of 36% and 30% respectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nike, Levi's and Lululemon are among big-name US brands that have the bulk of their clothing made in these countries.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Can you imagine what will happen if [we] lose our jobs? I'm so worried, especially for my kids. They need food,\" says Nao Soklin, who works in a garment factory in southeastern Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Soklin and her husband Kok Taok make a living sewing bags for 10 hours a day. Together, they earn about $570 a month – barely enough to cover rent and provide for their two young sons and aged parents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[I want to] send a message to President Trump, to tell him to please lift the tariff on Cambodia... We need our jobs to support our families,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia, which has become a popular alternative to Chinese retailers because of its ready supply of low-wage labour, exported more than $3bn worth of apparel to the US last year, according to the Asean Statistics Division. The sector, which employs more than 900,000 people, makes up more than a tenth of the country's overall exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Sri Lanka, exports to the US helped the garment industry – which directly employs some 350,000 people – earn $1.9bn last year, making it the country's third-largest foreign exchange earner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If [30%] is the end number, Sri Lanka is in trouble because our competitors, such as Vietnam, have received lower tariffs,\" Yohan Lawrence, secretary general of Sri Lanka's Joint Apparel Association Forum, told the Reuters news agency.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Last-ditch negotiations</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sri Lankan authorities are hopeful of negotiating a further reduction to the tariffs but have not disclosed what they would consider an acceptable rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of its leaders have noted that the country has received the highest concession – of 14 percentage points – so far as a result of earlier negotiations. \"We see this as the beginning of a very good situation,\" secretary to the Finance Minister Harshana Suriyapperuma said last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia, which got a 13 percentage point concession, is also seeking further talks.  \"We are doing everything we can to protect the interests of investors and workers,\" said Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, who leads the negotiating team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We want the tariff to be zero...

The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Born in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four.

JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A one million rupees [$11,600; £8,600] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbi.gov.in/press-detail/MjU0Mg==#:~:text=CBI%20ANNOUNCES%20A%20REWARD%20OF,STUDENT%20OF%20JAWAHARLAL%20NEHRU%20UNIVERSITY\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reward for information</a> about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images) JNU students with people from different organisations, during a protest march and dharna against Delhi Police over missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed at Jantar Mantar, on December 14, 2016 in New Delhi, India.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images)</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Najeeb Ahmed's disappearance sparked massive protests in Delhi in 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Explaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Colin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked. <b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees says she's not done fighting.

Protests are set to continue this Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least five demonstrators have died while confronting official security forces in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it is not the orthodox political opposition – predictably crushed in local elections last week – that has mobilised frustrated young Togolese people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead it is musicians, bloggers and activists who have tapped into popular anger and weariness with a regime that has been in power – under the leadership of Faure Gnassingbé or, before him – his father Gnassingbé Éyadéma, for almost six decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That outstrips even Cameroon's 92-year old President Paul Biya - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckglpnk0kqko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">who has just confirmed his intention to stand for an eighth successive term</a> in elections later this year – or Gabon's father-and-son presidents, Omar Bongo and Ali Bongo, latter of whom was deposed in a coup in August 2023.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The lessons of that episode did not escape Faure Gnassingbé, a shrewd and often discreet operator who quickly moved to devise a new constitutional structure for Togo, to prolong his own hold on power while playing down his personal profile, in a bid to defuse accusations of dynastic rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He will no longer need to stand for re-election in his own name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 59-year-old holds the premiership because his Union pour la République (Unir) party dominates the national assembly - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, thanks to a constituency map gerrymandered to over-represent its northern heartlands and understate the voting weight of the pro-opposition coastal south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gilbert Bawara, Togo's civil service and labour minister, maintains the 2024 election was above board, with \"all the major political actors and parties\" taking part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The government cannot be held responsible for the weakness of the opposition,\" Bawara told BBC Focus on Africa TV last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that those with a genuine reason to demonstrate could do so within the law, blaming activists abroad for inciting \"young people to attack security forces\" in an attempt to destabilise the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The new constitutional framework was announced at short notice in early 2024 and quickly approved by the compliant government-dominated national assembly. There was no attempt to secure general public approval through a referendum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A one-year transition concluded this May as Gnassingbé – who had been head of state since 2005 – gave up the presidency and was installed in the premiership, a post now strengthened to hold all executive power and total authority over the armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To occupy the presidency, a role now reduced to a purely ceremonial function, legislators chose the 86-year old former business minister, Jean-Lucien Savi de Tové.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu/Getty Images Four girls in colourful print clothes with headscarves on a motorbike driven by a young man in a grey sweatshirt and white helmet seen recently on a street in Lomé, Togo.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Anadolu/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Togo is one of the poorest countries in the world and has been governed by the Gnassingbé family for almost 60 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This reshuffling of the power structure was presented abroad by regime mouthpieces as moving from a strong presidential system to a supposedly more democratic \"parliamentary\" model – in tune with the traditions of the Commonwealth, which Togo, like Gabon, had joined in 2022, to broaden its international connections and reduce reliance on traditional francophone links with France, the former colonial ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The transition to new constitutional arrangements designed to perpetuate Gnassingbé's rule passed off almost without outside comment from international partners whose attention is currently focussed on Gaza and Ukraine rather than Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nor was there any complaint from fellow leaders in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), even after Togo held fresh legislative elections just weeks after the new constitution had been promulgated, in flagrant breach of the regional bloc's protocol on good governance and democracy, which says that after a change of constitution at least six months must elapse before any major election is held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Badly shaken by the decision of three military-run countries -

It later announced a plan to address \"systemic issues\" in the culture of ice hockey.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What is the case about?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The complainant, a woman known publicly as EM due to a standard publication ban, alleges that a group of hockey players engaged in sexual activity with her without her consent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The accused are Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Carter Hart. All were players with the National Hockey League (NHL) when the allegations surfaced, although one was playing in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over nine days of sometimes graphic testimony during the trial, EM described how a one-night stand with McLeod turned into a group sexual assault. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">EM said she went to McLeod's hotel room after meeting him at a local bar, and they had consensual sexual intercourse. But she alleges he invited other teammates into the room, leaving her shocked and humiliated as they engaged in sexual activity with her that she said she did not consent to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the course of the trial, the judge has heard that the players performed a variety of sexual acts on her, including oral sex, intercourse, and slapping the woman's buttocks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lawyers for the players tell a different story, asserting EM consented to these acts.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They argue she gave the men the impression that she wanted to have a \"wild night\" and that she had discussed with McLeod inviting his friends over \"to have some fun\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The players claim the woman asked them to have sex with her, and that she had agreed to what transpired that evening in London.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How the trial unfolded</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were many legal twists and turns since the trial began on 23 April, including a declaration of a mistrial early on and the dismissal of the jury mid-way through, after members accused some defence lawyers of mocking them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case will now be decided by the judge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In opening arguments, Crown attorney Heather Donkers warned the jury that the case would be unconventional and might challenge preconceptions about consent and assault.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It would not be about whether the woman \"removed herself from an unwelcome situation\", but rather if she \"voluntarily agreed to engage in each and every sexual act that took place\", she argued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Evidence included texts from McLeod's phone, which showed him inviting the other players to his room for a \"3 way\" and asking EM to make a police investigation into the night \"go away\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court also viewed a group chat from June 2018 between the players in which they appeared to discuss damage control after they had been informed that there would be an internal Hockey Canada investigation into the incident. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A text on the group chat from McLeod's phone read: \"We all need to say the same thing if we get interviewed [by Hockey Canada], can't have different stories or make anything up.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"No boys, like you don't need to make anything up. No one did anything wrong. We went to that room to eat. The girl came. She wanted to have sex with all of us,\" another teammate replied. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court was also shown two videos of the woman wrapped in a towel after the incident, where she can be heard saying \"it was all consensual\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over days of testimony, EM<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>said that she was \"uncomfortable\" and went on \"auto-pilot\" mode as the men demanded sex acts from her, and that they at one point discussed putting golf balls and a golf club in her vagina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The woman told the court that she had adopted a \"porn star persona\" as a coping mechanism. A lawyer for one of the players countered by arguing that her actions made the men think she was consenting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Defence lawyers also used text messages EM sent to her friend the following day, noting that she discussed the incident but did not say she was sexually assaulted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm going to suggest to you that if you had – in any way, shape or form – felt that you had been sexually violated or assaulted that night, you would have said that to your best friend,\" defence lawyer Lisa Carnelos said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Only one of the accused players, Carter Hart, testified in his own defence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Asked by the Crown why the woman was asked to be filmed giving consent, he responded that it was common practice for professional athletes.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">From jury to judge alone</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case was re-opened by London police after their initial investigation in 2018 and early 2019 ended without charges. Formal charges were later laid in early 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The five players have had to put their hockey careers on hold during the case. All had NHL contracts when they were asked to surrender to police in January 2024, forcing them to take a leave of absence from their respective teams. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their NHL contracts have since expired. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just two days after the trial began on 23 April, a mistrial was declared by Justice Carroccia after an interaction between a jury member and one of the defence lawyers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A new trial was then ordered with a brand new, 14-member jury.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then on<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>16 May, that jury was dismissed when one member complained to Justice Carroccia that the same defence lawyer had laughed at them and mocked their appearance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While the judge said she had not witnessed bad behaviour, the accusation compromised the fairness of the trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead of restarting the trial once again, lawyers for both sides agreed the case would be decided by the judge alone.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Its wider impact in Canada</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case has made headlines across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Carolynn Conron, a criminal lawyer from London, Ontario, told the BBC that the courtroom was crammed on the first days - especially during EM's testimony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The high profile of the defendants, and the revered place that ice hockey has in the national consciousness, has captivated attention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is quite an extraordinary case from a legal and social perspective,\" said Daphne Gilbert, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, citing the \"winding\" and \"unusual\" road leading up to the trial, as well as the impact the allegations have had on Hockey Canada as an institution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Legally, Prof Gilbert said there is interest in how the case could reshape how consent is interpreted in Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has been established under Canadian law that consent is not the absence of \"no,\" but rather the affirmation of \"yes\" in words or conduct. Consent also cannot be obtained prior to or after the sexual act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the case raises important questions on how consent can be interpreted in a situation where the victim says they felt that they have no choice, Prof Gilbert said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has been criticism of the proceedings from some, especially from support groups for victims of sexual assault.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Ontario Coalition of Rape Crisis Centres, which is a network of more than 30 community-based sexual assault centres in Ontario, said the trial and the conduct of the attorneys perpetuates harmful \"myths\" about sexual assault.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Over the last few weeks and five cross-examinations in court, EM has faced almost every harmful and victim-blaming sexual assault myth in existence,\" they said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A big question will be if it was \"ultimately good for EM to have gone through this experience,\" regardless of the outcome, said Prof Gilbert.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There will be conversations about how we treat sexual assault complainants and what we ask for them in these cases,\" she said, with some likely wondering: \"Is it worth it?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman did not say whether the players would be allowed to return to play in the league if they were acquitted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have said continuously we are not making any comments while the judicial process is taking place. We respect that,\" Mr Bettman said earlier this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I want to be clear. What has been alleged is abhorrent and disgusting and should not be allowed,\" he added.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Like others, he had lingering questions about the mysteries surrounding the case, including a motive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kohberger chose not to speak on Wednesday, with just family and friends of the victims describing the traumatic impact of his crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ben Mogen, Madison's father, the deal marked a moment of closure for a family that had dreaded a gruelling trial after years of being thrust into the national spotlight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's been this nightmare that's approaching in our heads,\" Mr Mogen told the New York Times.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A nightmare in a close-knit college town</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was a typical Saturday night out for four young college students near the tree-lined University of Idaho campus, weeks before the Thanksgiving break.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Xana Kernodle, 20, and her boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, went to a party at his fraternity.

The mystery - and the nationwide attention it attracted - left the small Idaho town reeling while obsessive amateur internet sleuths tried to fill in the blanks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Finally, on 30 December, after weeks of unanswered questions, police announced they had arrested a suspect, Kohberger, at his family home hundreds of miles away in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A crime with no known motive</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly three years later, there is no public explanation why Kohberger murdered the four students, to whom he had no known connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kohberger himself has not offered any reasons, only entering a guilty plea in court to planning and carrying out the stabbings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Journalists and members of the public have sought answers, digging into Kohberger's past, and finding old writings online about struggles with depression, his lack of remorse and a former heroin addiction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He had a fascination with criminals, studying under true crime writer and forensic psychologist Katherine Ramsland, who expressed shock that a man she viewed as polite and respectful could have committed such crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">​​\"I thought, 'they have to have this wrong,'\" she <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/02/us/kohberger-serial-killer-teacher-ramsland.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">told</a> the New York Times. \"It's not the Bryan Kohberger that I know.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kohberger would eventually pursue a criminology doctorate at Washington State University, where he was fired from his job as a teaching assistant for evaluating students too harshly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Newly released documentaries and books - including one by thriller novelist James Patterson - have speculated about his motive, suggesting that he was angry about romantic rejections, or even that he was trying to emulate <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43892189\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">misogynist killer Elliot Rodger</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A gag order in the case prevented those close to the investigation from speaking out.

A private Facebook group about the case gained more than 30,000 members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Relatives and friends of the victims were bombarded with messages, some accusing - without any evidence - grieving roommates and others who were close to the victims of being involved in the murders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some descended on the small college town, trying to access the boarded house, surrounded with caution tape. The frenzy frustrated local law enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is speculation, without factual backing, stoking community fears and spreading false facts,\" the Moscow Police Department said at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Behind the scenes, investigators were combing through thousands of tips from the public, cell phone records and video surveillance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several pieces of evidence helped them eventually piece together the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A white Hyundai Elantra car captured in footage near the scene of the crime matched Kohberger's vehicle. Cell phone records put the 30-year-old near the Moscow off-campus home at the time of the murders, and suggested he drove by the house repeatedly leading up to, then hours after, the crime, before roommates learned of the horrible scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps the most important piece of evidence came from a key item left behind: a knife sheath with DNA that matched a sample taken from trash at Kohberger's family home in Pennsylvania, where officials would finally track him down during his holiday break.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A small town tries to move past tragedy</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3944/live/0f9eb3a0-666e-11f0-b6be-43d98367b4c3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A house where four students were murdered is cordoned off\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The house where the four students were murdered has since been destroyed</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 1122 King Road, just a few streets away from the centre of the University of Idaho's campus, the grey-shuttered three-story home no longer sits on a slope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A year after the murders, the school decided to tear down the off-campus house where the four students were killed, calling it a \"grim reminder\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[I]t is time for its removal and to allow the collective healing of our community to continue,\" the university said at the time, eliciting mixed reactions from the victims' relatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With a guilty plea for Kohberger now secured, Mogen's family agrees that it is time to turn from \"tragedy and mourning\" to \"the light of the future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her father has said the marketing student was \"known for her ability to make others smile and laugh\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Goncalves, Mogen's good friend, was a \"defender and protector\" of her family who \"did absolutely everything she set her mind to\", relatives said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chapin's mother said her son, who was a triplet, was \"the life of the party\" and \"the kindest person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kernodle was a strong-willed student who was with her friends \"all the time\", her father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To honour their memories, university students last year built a circular steel structure engraved with the four students' names, where visitors have come to lay flower bouquets, stones, candles and notes remembering their lost friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lying in a grassy memorial garden, the top of the structure lights up at night, one of the sole remaining signs of a tragedy that shook the small Idaho town.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

roughly the equivalent of the population of Tunisia or Belgium.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF had seized Khartoum soon after the war started in April 2023, following a massive fall-out between Gen Burhan and his then-ally, the paramilitary group's commander, Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, better known as \"Hemedti\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF helped Burhan stage a coup in 2021 and crush dissent until they turned on each other after Gen Dagalo resisted his plan to integrate the paramilitary force into the army.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">International Crisis Group think-tank analyst Alan Boswell told the BBC that the army now wanted to defeat the RSF in Kordofan so that it could push westwards into Darfur - the paramilitary group's birthplace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the other hand, the RSF wanted to seize Kordofan as it would give it \"new momentum\" and put it \"within striking distance of central Sudan, including the capital, again\", Mr Boswell said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Suliman Baldo, the director of Sudan Transparency and Policy Tracker think-tank, told the BBC that he doubted the army could break through RSF defence lines in Kordofan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the majority of RSF fighters were from the large Misseriya ethnic group living in West Kordofan state, which borders Darfur, \"and therefore they will be fighting to protect their own communities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Airstrikes earlier this month by the army in West Kordofan - including its capital, el-Fula, and the town of Abu Zabad - have also antagonised local people, he said, adding that it was a \"counterproductive policy of collective punishment of the so-called social incubators\" of the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The army still controls oil fields in the region, but the RSF had threatened to expand the war to oil-producing Heglig in South Kordofan, near the border with South Sudan, if the air bombardment did not stop.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If the army's aviation returns again and bombs citizens in West Kordofan state, we will strike and shut down Heglig's oil and kill the engineers,\" Youssef Awadallah Aliyan, the head of the RSF's civilian administration in the state, was quoted as saying by the Sudan Tribune news site after visiting the market hit by airstrikes in el-Fula.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) said the strikes on el-Fula and Abu Zabad, including on a school sheltering families, reportedly killed more than 20 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ocha condemned the attacks, saying that civilians and civilian buildings - including schools, homes, and shelters - should \"never be targeted\", and warring groups should uphold international humanitarian law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF has also been accused of targeting civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN children's agency (Unicef) said more than 450 civilians -

And a photo posted on the platform showed her posing with American adult film star Kendra Lust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Suddenly everyone wanted to know about her  - and the name Babydoll Archi trended in Google search and  spawned countless memes and fan pages. But there was one issue about to emerge – there was no real woman behind the online sensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Instagram account was fake, although the face it used had uncanny likeness to a real woman - a homemaker in Dibrugarh city in Assam, whom we'll call Sanchi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The truth unravelled after her brother lodged a police complaint. Pratim Bora, Sanchi's ex-boyfriend, was arrested. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senior police officer Sizal Agarwal who's heading the investigation told the BBC that Sanchi and Bora had a falling out and the AI likeness he created was to exact \"pure revenge\" on her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bora - a mechanical engineer and a self-taught artificial intelligence (AI) enthusiast  - used private photos of Sanchi to create a fake profile, Ms Agarwal said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bora is in custody and has not made any statements yet. The BBC has reached out to his family and will update the article when they speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Babydoll Archi was created in 2020 and the first uploads were made in May 2021.

Ms Agarwal says they had also seen media reports and comments speculating that she was AI generated, but there had been no suggestion that it was based on a real person.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Once they received the complaint, police wrote to Instagram asking for the details of the account's creator.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Once we received information from Instagram, we asked Sanchi if she knew any Pratim Bora.

The BBC has asked Meta what they are planning to do about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meghna Bal, AI expert and lawyer, says what happened to Sanchi \"is horrible but almost impossible to prevent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She can go to the court and seek the right to be forgotten, and a court can order the press reports that named her to be taken down but it's hard to scrub all the trace from the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What happened to Sanchi, she says, is what's always been happening to women, where their photos and videos are circulated as revenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's now a lot easier to do because of AI, but such incidents are still not as common as we expect - or they could be under-reported because of stigma or people being targeted may not even know about it as in the present case,\" Ms Bal says. And people watching it had no incentive to report it to the social media platform or cybercrime portal, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their complaint against Mr Bora, police have invoked sections of law that deal with sexual harassment, distribution of obscene material, defamation, forgery to harm reputation, cheating by personification and cybercrime. If found guilty, Mr Bora could get up to 10 years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case which has also led to outrage on social media in recent days has seen some seeking tougher laws to deal with such cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Bal believes there are enough laws to take care of such cases, but whether there's scope for new laws to deal with generative AI companies has to be looked at.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But we also have to remember that deepfakes are not necessarily bad and laws have to be carefully crafted because they can be weaponised to chill free speech.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
