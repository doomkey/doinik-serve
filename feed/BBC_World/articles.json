Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are two options,\" Zelensky said, \"either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 20-point plan is seen as an update of an original 28-point document, agreed by US envoy Steve Witkoff with the Russians several weeks ago, which was widely seen as heavily geared towards the Kremlin's demands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Russians have insisted that Ukraine pulls out of almost a quarter of its own territory in the eastern Donetsk region in return for a peace deal. The rest is already under Russian occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sensitive issues including questions over territory would have to be resolved \"at the leaders' level\", but the new draft would provide Ukraine with strong security guarantees and a military strength of 800,000, Zelensky explained.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of the updated plan resembles what came out of recent talks in Berlin involving US negotiators Witkoff and Jared Kushner with Ukrainian and European leaders. The setting then moved to Miami last weekend where US President Donald Trump's team spoke separately to Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev and then Ukrainian and European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There now appears to be far more detail on the territorial issue, although it is clear the Ukrainian side was unable to reach a consensus with the Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky explained that if Ukraine was prepared to pull its heavy forces back by five, 10 or 40km in the 25% of Donetsk it still held to create an economic zone, making it virtually demilitarised, then Russia would have to do the same \"accordingly by five, 10, or 40km\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian troops are currently about 40km (25 miles) east of Ukraine's \"fortress belt\" cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr4d99p63y4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">having captured the town of Siversk</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to be impressed by the kind of compromise being proposed for Donetsk. He said this month that Russia would take control of the entire east of Ukraine by force if Ukrainian troops did not pull out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Trump is pushing for a deal to end almost four years of full-scale war and the Ukrainian president believes Russia cannot afford to reject the US plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They cannot tell President Trump, 'look we're against a peaceful settlement',\" Zelensky told reporters. \"If they try to obstruct everything, then President Trump would have to arm us heavily, while imposing all possible sanctions against them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky made clear that if a free economic zone were established in Donetsk it would have to be under Ukrainian administration and police - \"definitely not the so-called Russian police\". The current front line would then become the boundary of the economic zone with international forces on the ground along the contact line to ensure no Russian infiltration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has so far rejected a European proposal to police any peace deal through a Coalition of the Willing as a \"brazen threat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A referendum would need to be held on the whole peace plan, Zelensky said, and only a referendum could decide on the idea of a potential free economic zone in Donbas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He emphasised that an economic zone would also have to be set up around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant currently occupied by Russia, and that Russian troops would have to pull out of four other Ukrainian regions - Dnipropetrovsk, Mykolaiv, Sumy, and Kharkiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current US proposal for the nuclear plant would be for Ukraine, the US and Russia to operate it jointly, but Kyiv disagreed with that, Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main points of the plan reaffirm Ukraine's sovereignty and propose a non-aggression pact between Russia and its neighbour with a monitoring mechanism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as strong security guarantees mirroring Nato's Article Five, which requires members to aid an ally under attack, Ukraine is to be allowed a maximum military strength of 800,000 in peacetime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Discussions are still going on over a US plan to receive compensation in return for security guarantees, so Zelensky says it is not currently part of the document.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no reference barring Ukraine from joining Nato, which was in the original 28-point plan and something Russia has consistently demanded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the latest framework proposes that Ukraine joins the European Union with a defined date of accession. It is currently a candidate, but a number of other candidate countries are seen as first in line, such as Albania.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are plans for a Ukraine investment fund of about $200bn (£150bn) involving both the US and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the other points is a requirement for Ukraine to hold elections as soon as possible after the deal is signed. Russia and the US have both pushed for a vote, even though Ukraine is under martial law because of the full-scale invasion. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US authorities have discovered more than a million more documents potentially related to the late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein that they plan to release in the coming days and weeks, officials say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice (DoJ) about the discovery and turned over the documents for lawyers to review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible,\" the DoJ said on social media on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The department said that given the volume of material, the process could take \"a few more weeks\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement did not specify how the FBI and New York prosecutors came across the additional material. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents last week - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims’ identities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the documents released last week had names and other information blacked out, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the  aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Included in the first release of documents were emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. Peter Mandelson was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff  that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost his 'prince' title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following weeks of intense scrutiny over his links to Epstein following a document release in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the latest release on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response. He has repeatedly denied wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, the board of the Kennedy Center - which Trump filled with allies - voted to rename the performing arts centre the Trump-Kennedy Center. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beatty is one of several Democratic lawmakers designated as members of the board by US law. She claimed in her lawsuit that the renaming was illegal because changing the name requires \"an act of Congress\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suit says Beatty had called into the meeting about the name change but was muted when she tried to voice her opposition. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beatty argues that Congress intended for the centre to be a \"living memorial\" to former President Kennedy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[I]n scenes more reminiscent of authoritarian regimes than the American republic – the sitting President and his handpicked loyalists renamed this storied center after President Trump,\" the lawsuit states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement provided to the BBC, the White House said Trump had \"stepped up\" and saved the Kennedy Center \"by strengthening its finances, modernizing the building, and ending divisive woke programming\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a result, the Board of the Kennedy Center voted unanimously to rename it the Trump-Kennedy Center — a historic move that marks a new era of success, prestige, and restored grandeur for one of America's most iconic cultural institutions,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, the president's name was added to the exterior of the building, and the centre's website logo now reads \"The Trump Kennedy Center\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The name change has been met with harsh criticism, particularly in Washington DC where the centre has been an iconic landmark since it was built and named for Kennedy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2b47/live/82abccd0-e0f2-11f0-a016-cd64476883b3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt='Bloomberg via Getty Images Workers outside the Kennedy Center are on lifts in front of the building, where a sign now says \"The Donald J.

Extraterritorial overreach by foreign censors targeting American speech is no exception.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed from the CCDH, which says it advocates for government action against hate speech and disinformation online, has links to senior Labour figures. He was previously an aide to Labour minister Hilary Benn, and Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has served as a director of the group he founded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US government labelled Ahmed a \"collaborator\" for the CCDH's purported past work with the Biden administration. BBC News has contacted the CCDH for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Melford founded the GDI, a non-profit that monitors the spread of disinformation, in 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Undersecretary of State Sarah B Rogers accused the GDI of using US taxpayer money \"to exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A GDI spokesperson told the BBC that \"the visa sanctions announced today are an authoritarian attack on free speech and an egregious act of government censorship\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Trump Administration is, once again, using the full weight of the federal government to intimidate, censor, and silence voices they disagree with.

It said the platform's blue tick system was \"deceptive\" because the firm was not \"meaningfully verifying users\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Musk's site blocked the Commission from sharing adverts on its platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reacting to the visa ban, Breton posted on X: \"To our American friends: Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also subject to bans were Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organisation that the State Department said helped enforce the DSA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement to the BBC, the two CEOs called it an \"act of repression by a government that is increasingly disregarding the rule of law and trying to silence its critics by any means necessary\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They added: \"We will not be intimidated by a government that uses accusations of censorship to silence those who stand up for human rights and freedom of expression.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing.

This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims.

But, according to the DoJ, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home.

Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her.

Thirteen Ukrainian soldiers were also captured in the border village in the northeastern Sumy region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack occurred at night on Saturday, when about 100 Russian troops attacked the village, said Viktor Trehubov, a spokesman for Ukraine's military Joint Forces Task Force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The civilians were first rounded up in a church and then taken across the border to Russia, he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was unusual for invading forces to take civilians to Russia before establishing a firm presence in occupied territory, he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has so far not commented on the fate of civilians from Hrabovske, but reports from Ukraine indicate they may have been taken to Belgorod, a major regional centre about 50 miles (80 km) inside Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My friends' mother has been taken there.

I'm simply surprised that parents treated their children like that,\" Zelensky told reporters. \"I think they simply did not expect to be taken [to Russia] by Russian military.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vast majority of civilians had already been evacuated from the village, whose pre-war population is reported to be about 700 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets says the civilians \"were held incommunicado and in improper conditions\" by Russian troops invading Hrabovske before being taken out of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Such actions are a serious violation of international humanitarian law.

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing.

This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted.

Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her.

The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years. It was backed by the Pope, who called the statement \"very important\" and urged all Catholics and \"people of goodwill, to listen carefully\" to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f707/live/52ba7590-d9a8-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents conduct operations in the Little Village neighborhood, a predominantly Mexican American community in Chicago, United States on November 08, 2025. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Chicago has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Picking a fight with the Pope</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the relationship is quite tense,\" says David Gibson, director of Fordham University's Center on Religion and Culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conservatives had hoped that Pope Leo would bring a change from his predecessor Pope Francis's focus on issues of social justice and migration, according to Gibson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many of them are angry. They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Bangladeshi police, however, said there was no confirmation that the suspect had left the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, the South Asian neighbours have suspended visa services in several cities, including Delhi, and accused each other of failing to ensure adequate security for their diplomatic missions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries have also summoned each other's high commissioners to raise their security concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I sincerely hope tensions don't escalate further on both sides,\" Riva Ganguly Das, a former Indian high commissioner to Dhaka, told the BBC, adding that the \"volatile situation\" in Bangladesh made it difficult to predict which way things would go.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/410d/live/cb5f8ee0-dfd9-11f0-8f37-51273813293d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Graffiti is painted in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on December 21, 2025, in memory of Osman Hadi, who is killed by an assailant's gunfire.

A witness at the Madlanga Commission was also murdered after giving evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's what we've learned so far:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Role of the 'Big Five Cartel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He named two figures from the five alleged leaders of this criminal gang, one of them being controversial businessman Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala is currently facing 25 criminal charges, among them attempted murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These stem from three separate incidents that occurred between 2022 and 2024. He has denied all the charges against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crime intelligence boss claimed the Big Five led a network with widespread influence across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Big Five has already penetrated the political sphere and there are documented cases of high-profile connections in the political arena,\" the policeman alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Anonymised – and known only as \"witness C\" - he also mentioned what he called the Big Five cartel, alleging it had \"full control and oversight\" in every government department.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is 'Cat' Matlala?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gallo Images via Getty Images A composite of four head-and-shoulders photographs of Vusimusi Cat Matlala as he was giving evidence to the parliamentary inquiry showing him giving different hand gestures.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gallo Images via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala spent two days giving testimony at the parliamentary inquiry</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He shared copies of text messages and a payment allegedly made by Matlala to prove this at the time. These payments were seemingly facilitated by a third party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his appearance at the Madlanga Commission Mchunu refuted the allegations saying that he had \"never been accused of corruption, not once\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the first time I get accused of such.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2001, he was convicted and served time for the possession of stolen goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing at the parliamentary inquiry, Mr Matlala said he had turned his life around in 2017, when he \"formally registered my first business which was a security business\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he is now in custody over the attempted murder charge, he gave evidence with restraints around his ankles. Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apart from being accused of having close ties to Mchunu, Mr Matlala has been linked to others in the police force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"From what I understand, the minister [Mchunu] sent [a third party] to go ask for donations there and there, and I was one of them,\" Mr Matlala told MPs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also told the parliamentary panel that after the authorities had returned firearms seized from him, former Police Minister Bheki Cele had demanded \"a facilitation fee\" of 1m rand ($60,000; £45,000) to which he only paid half the amount. Mr Matlala alleged that Cele also allegedly asked for this money to stop harassment from the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He, however, denied receiving money from Mr Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala has not yet appeared at the Madlanga Commission but is expected to have a chance to speak there at some point next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various witnesses, however, painted a different picture of Mr Matlala's relationship with the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Commission witness later murdered</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness at the Madlanga Commission was murdered in early December, just three weeks after he gave testimony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear if the two events were connected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marius van der Merwe, who was identified only as \"Witness D\" during his appearance, was killed in full view of his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had just returned home in the evening and was gunned down as he waited for the front gate to open.
