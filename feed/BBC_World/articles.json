Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky, writing on X later on Tuesday, said Ukraine and Europe were working actively on \"all components of potential steps toward ending the war\", that the Ukrainian and European elements of the plan were now more developed and that Kyiv was ready to present them to \"our partners in the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's latest public criticism of Europe comes a day after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k4z9nwz4yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">European leaders came together in London</a> to discuss their continued joint efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether Europe could help end the war, the US president said: \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials have held separate talks with Ukrainian and Russian officials in recent weeks in an attempt to broker an end to the war. So far, no agreement has been reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's president has pressed European and Nato leaders to help deter the US from backing a deal that Kyiv fears would leave it exposed to future attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Trump suggested, without evidence, that Zelensky was the main obstacle to peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told reporters that Russia was \"fine\" with the peace plan outlined to both sides by the US, that contained major concessions for Ukraine and which allies feared would leave it vulnerable to a future invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Politico interview, he claimed Ukrainian negotiators \"loved\" the US-backed proposal and alleged Zelensky had not yet read it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also claimed ideological divisions now threatened to fracture Washington's alliances with Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether leaders he viewed as weak could still be allies, he replied: \"It depends\", adding: \"I think they're weak, but I also think that they want to be so politically correct. I think they don't know what to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's remarks came after his administration released its new 33-page National Security Strategy, which warned of Europe's potential \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether some nations could remain reliable allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia welcomed that strategy - which did not cast Russia as a threat to the US - as \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe \"will not be viable countries any longer\" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: \"What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He singled out Hungary and Poland as doing a \"very good job\" on immigration, but said most European nations were \"decaying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding on Tuesday to the strategy, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said some parts were plausible and some understandable, but other elements were unacceptable from a European point of view. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He rejected the idea that the US needed to \"save democracy\" in Europe, saying Europeans could address such questions themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c179p4wvz29o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year</a>, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The institute had previously said she would attend the ceremony in person. Earlier on Tuesday, a spokesman said \"everything suggests\"  the press conference would be able to take place on Tuesday despite the delay. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government has said that if Machado left Venezuela she would be considered a \"fugitive\" by the authorities. Her family are already in Oslo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told AFP last month: \"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive\". He said she is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had earlier told her followers that she would return to Venezuela after collecting the prize.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If she attends, it would be her first public appearance since January 2025. She last appeared in public at a protest in Caracas on 9 January against the inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Venezuela's 2024 election, the opposition published tallies after the election suggesting it won, despite Maduro claiming victory, and some nations including the US have recognised its candidate - Edmundo Gonzalez - as the president-elect. Ms Machado was banned from running in the election.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The bill is expected to pass with support from both parties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump says release of the video is something for Hegseth to decide.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump denied that he had previously said he would have \"no problem\" with the footage being made public - despite that comment being made on camera as recently as Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The threat from Congress to withhold money from Hegseth's travel budget has emerged amid a clamour for information from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is buried within a 3,000-page draft bill that is focused on approving next year's defence spending. The annual bill authorises nearly $901bn in funding (£687m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill's final wording, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/ndaa-boat-strikes-congress-hegseth-without-funds-00680679\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">first reported by Politico</a>, states that Hegseth's office may spend no more than three-quarters of the funds made available for travel for the year 2026 until it meets certain requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include an obligation to give the House and Senate armed service committees all \"unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations in the area of responsibility of the United States Southern Command\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The wording nods to the way Trump has characterised his strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Dozens of people have been killed in the months-long campaign, but the administration has not publicly provided evidence for its assertions of criminality in each case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have raised questions about the legality of the strikes, prompting concern from Republicans and Democrats alike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regarding the \"double-tap\" attack on 2 September specifically, the experts point out that the so-called laws of war decree that the parties in an armed conflict are obliged to pick up wounded survivors of a strike rather than attack them again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nine people died in the first strike on the vessel and two survivors were left clinging to the burning wreckage when it was struck again, killing them, according to the Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has repeatedly said it is working within the laws of armed conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It says the second strike was ordered by a navy admiral, and not by Hegseth, who has become a focal point for scrutiny of both the strike and the White House narrative surrounding it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior members of Congress who were shown the video in a briefing last week by that admiral, Frank Bradley, emerged with differing views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he found the video of the second attack \"deeply, deeply troubling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas disagreed, calling the strikes \"entirely lawful and needful\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Lawmakers react to boat strike video showed in classified briefing</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously posted video of the first strike from 2 September, and continues to be asked whether he will release video of the second.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Wednesday, the president responded to an on-camera question about the video from an ABC News reporter by saying: \"I don't know what they have, but whatever they have, we'd certainly release, no problem.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five days later, he responded to a question from the same network by saying: \"I didn't say that.

It grants the armed forces additional powers to respond faster and more effectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belarus's long-time leader is a close ally of Russia's Vladimir Putin, and Lithuania's president, Gitanas Nauseda, has said there is a lot of evidence that the balloon threat is a \"deliberate action aimed at destabilising the situation in Lithuania\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of European countries have faced a range of threats from Russia, which the EU has condemned as a \"hybrid campaign\" that includes sabotage, disruption to critical infrastructure and most recently drone flights near sensitive sites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the head of Nato's military committee, Adml Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, said the Western military alliance was considering a more \"aggressive\" or \"pro-active\" stance to Russia's hybrid warfare.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lithuania has accused Belarus of this kind of provocation before. Four years ago, thousands of irregular migrants mostly from the Middle East crossed the Belarusian border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to the latest threat, Lithuania closed two border checkpoints with Belarus for three weeks from the end of October. Belarus then barred Lithuanian trucks from driving on its roads and hundreds of Lithuanian vehicles are still understood to be stranded there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are talking about aviation security and international law, and about the fact that such actions could be recognised as terrorism,\" Ruginiene said last week, in reference to both the balloons and the blocked trucks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The weather balloons can fly to a height of 10km (6 miles) and Lithuania's interior ministry says they have led to Vilnius airport being closed for more than 60 hours since October. Some 30,000 passenger were affected in October alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lukashenko told Belarusian TV on Tuesday that what the Lithuanians were accusing Belarus of was impossible: \"It is unrealistic. Even if balloons flew into there, even if they did, I have spoken to pilots and they say that they pose no problem.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The question arises why,\" he added. \"Do they want to fight us? We do not need war. I am convinced that the Lithuanian people do not need war either. Neither do Poles, Latvians and Estonians.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although flights into and out of Vilnius airport were disrupted for only a short period on Saturday night, it meant that 1,000 passengers were affected.  Authorities said they had intercepted 11 smuggling balloons and seized almost 40,000 packets of cigarettes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one night last week, the airport had to suspend operations three times and Finnish airline Finnair has cancelled all evening flights to Vilnius until the end of February because of the balloons.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) does not have aircraft. It launches drone strikes, but drones were excluded from the research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RSF has been internationally condemned for allegedly carrying out ethnic massacres in Sudan's western Darfur region, triggering charges of genocide by the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The RSF are being held responsible for a lot of damage and violations, and I think rightly so,\" says Mark Snoeck, who ran the project. \"But I think the SAF should also be held accountable for their actions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military has also faced international criticism, accused of indiscriminate bombings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SAF did not respond to a BBC request for comment. But it has previously denied allegations of targeting civilians, saying its airstrikes are \"directed solely at RSF gatherings, locations and bases recognized as legitimate military targets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness is an initiative by the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a non-profit group which works to expose human rights violations. It received funding from the British foreign ministry for this project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an advance copy of the report obtained by the BBC, Sudan Witness analysed 384 airstrikes conducted between April 2023 and July 2025.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 1,700 civilians were reported killed and 1,120 injured in the incidents it documented. The group says these are conservative figures as it takes the lowest reported number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were 135 cases involving residential areas, with verified destruction to homes and civilian infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 35 instances the bombs struck markets and commercial facilities, often when they were crowded with people. And 19 strikes affected vulnerable groups in places like health facilities, sites housing displaced people and educational institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness acknowledges that its research is incomplete because the results reflect access to data rather than the total number of strikes. It's hard to get information from conflict zones due to poor telecommunications and the difficulty of identifying credible sources, it says, and strikes on military targets are likely to be underreported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it says through a rigorous methodology, it has been able to build a wider picture of the military's air campaigns, visualising the information in an interactive map that shows the scale and impact on civilian populations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For us to say that the Sudanese Armed Forces conducted an airstrike on a certain location at a certain time would more or less require that the SAF be caught in the act in footage that can be verified,\" says Mr Snoeck. \"And this would be a very high threshold, because footage like that is very exceptional in Sudan. So what we therefore have done is analysed hundreds of airstrikes claims to paint the bigger picture.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main patterns that emerge are repeated hits on residential neighbourhoods and markets, says Mr Snoeck, as well as a large number of alleged strikes on essential humanitarian and medical facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think these patterns strongly suggest that the SAF isn't doing enough to avoid civilian casualties,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group which tracks foreign weapons supplies to Sudan, told the BBC that Sudanese civilians were bearing the brunt of the battles between the army and the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sudan's conflict is really a war against civilians,\" he told the BBC. \"Air power and other heavy weapons disproportionately target civilian, more than military, sites.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness calculates the credibility level of a reported airstrike based on publicly available digital information known as open source.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It assesses the reliability of the source, ability to analyse the location through videos posted to social media, and available satellite imagery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the incidents examined by Sudan Witness could be based only on reports. Where it was able to find corroborating evidence, it confirmed the attacks with a low-to-medium degree of certainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the group highlights cases where munitions, impact craters or shrapnel damage are identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one such instance Sudan Witness confirmed multiple videos and images showing a crater with an undetonated air-dropped bomb in the Zamzam camp for displaced people in North Darfur.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Facebook The twisted shell of a bomb is covered in dust and lies in a crater.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Facebook</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A photographer in Zamzam camp captured this image of an unexploded bomb that fell there last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appeared to match the SH-250 unguided munition produced by Military Industry Corporation, a Sudanese arms manufacturer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is still one of the most troubling findings I've worked on,\" says Mr Snoeck. \"Why drop an unguided bomb on a camp for internally displaced people?

The World Health Organisation and UN children's charity Unicef reported 16 civilians were killed, including three children and one healthcare worker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a rebel group allied to the army criticised this strike. The Sudan Tribune, an independent online news portal, quoted a spokesman for the Justice and Equality Movement, who said citizens were surprised by the indiscriminate airstrikes targeting hospitals and homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city of Nyala in South Darfur state is a frequent target. Its airport is alleged to be the main entry point for RSF weapons, including sophisticated drones, delivered by the United Arab Emirates.

well as disrupted the lives of many others</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness verified the location of footage of the destroyed market and corroborated it with satellite imagery showing new burn scars over the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Al-Kuma is located some 80km (50 miles) north-east of el-Fasher, until recently the focus of a fierce battle, and has been caught in the crossfire of SAF air assaults on the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is impossible for a country's army to bomb people with its air force and claim that it is doing so to protect the country,\" a local official told Dabanga, an independent Sudanese broadcaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another local source said the town had suffered more than 30 air raids since the beginning of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This evidence of military airstrikes hitting marketplaces and other civilian areas, shows a clear and unacceptable disregard for the safety of innocent Sudanese civilians,\" said a British foreign office official. \"Whatever side of the conflict they are on, the perpetrators of these heinous crimes must be held accountable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Sudan Witness Project has continued monitoring air raids beyond July 2025 but says there has been a shift towards drone strikes by both parties in recent months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The devastating cycle of aerial warfare sometimes targets groups seen as supporting the other side, says the Sudan War Monitor, highlighting an alleged SAF drone attack on al-Kuma in October, this time hitting a social gathering at the home of a local religious leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Al-Kuma is predominantly inhabited by the Ziyadiya, one of the Arab nomadic groups that form the social and ethnic backbone of the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That same weekend the RSF launched drone and artillery attacks on el-Fasher, striking a religious displacement centre and reportedly killing at least 60 civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">El-Fasher is dominated by non-Arab groups such as the Zaghawa, which RSF fighters associated with Zaghawa armed groups defending the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Neither side utilises drones and their airpower to primarily target military locations — they are either indiscriminate or designed to terrorise civilian populations under each other's control, which are war crimes,\" says Mr Lynch from Conflict Insights Group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SAF says the RSF seeks refuge within residential neighbourhoods and insists it is strictly observing international humanitarian laws and rules of engagement, including protection of civilians and their properties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both sides in Sudan's war have been accused of war crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week the RSF and its ally the Sudan Liberation Movement-North was accused of drone strikes that hit a kindergarten and a hospital in the South Kordofan town of Kalogi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The WHO said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c23e7kyl9myo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">114 people were killed, including 63 children</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lynch says not only are civilians suffering, neither side is achieving military success in the air war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"SAF have used aerial operations to support the takeover of Khartoum, but with that exception their use of airstrikes has resulted in a lot of civilian death and not a lot of military success,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Similarly, the RSF use foreign mercenaries backed by the UAE to fly drones, but with a few exceptions it hasn't actually achieved results.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.info-res.org/sudan-airstrikes-hub\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i

report on the state of the global environment has been \"hijacked\" by the United States and other countries who were unwilling to go along with the scientific findings, the co-chair has told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Global Environment Outlook, the result of six years' work, connects climate change, nature loss and pollution to unsustainable consumption by people living in wealthy and emerging economies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It warns of a \"dire future\" for millions unless there's a rapid move away from coal, oil and gas and fossil fuel subsidies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But at a meeting with government representatives to agree the findings, the US and allies said they could not go along with a summary of the report's conclusions.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the scientists were unwilling to water down or change their findings, the report has now been published without the summary and without the support of governments, weakening its impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Researchers say the objections to this new report reflect similar concerns expressed by countries at the recent COP30 talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached the relevant US government departments for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Issued every six or seven years, the Global Environment Outlook is a significant scientific analysis of the major threats to the planet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Developed under the auspices of the UN, the normal practice for studies like this is to have the key conclusions and recommendations agreed word by word with governments and published as a \"summary for policymakers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These summaries are seen as critical because they show that governments agree with the science and are prepared to put the findings into action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this new version of the Global Environment Outlook does not have this type of summary, as the authors and the political representatives of around 70 countries could not agree one at a \"stormy\" meeting in Nairobi in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compiled by nearly 300 scientists worldwide, the report argues that the food we eat, the clothes we wear, and the energy we consume all involve the extraction of resources in a highly unsustainable manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To solve the connected issues of climate change, pollution, nature and biodiversity loss, the report has many recommendations including a rapid move away from coal, oil and gas and a massive reduction in subsidies for farming and fossil fuels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authors acknowledge this type of action will drive-up prices for consumers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that short term pain will bring long term economic benefits for the whole world, the report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These strong measures, especially on fossil fuels and plastics, were too much for the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia among others at the approval meeting, which usually work by consensus.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

eZyhnA\">\"The US decided not to attend the meeting at all. At the very end they joined by teleconference and basically made a statement that they could not agree with most of the report, which means they didn't agree with anything we said on climate change, biodiversity, fossil fuels, plastics and subsidies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Robert is one of the world's most respected scientific voices. He's a former chief scientist for the UK's department of the environment and has also been chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), as well as working for the World Bank and Nasa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However he has had rows with the US in the past, criticising their decision to leave an earlier climate treaty, the Kyoto Protocol, when he was head of the IPCC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was ousted from that role in 2002 after lobbying by the administration of President George W. Bush.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others present at the meeting agreed that the actions of the US and other countries \"derailed\" the process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I thought we had gone beyond the point of recognizing that when you burn oil, this big, thick black stuff comes up, and it probably isn't good, especially when you try and breathe it in,\" said Dr David Broadstock, with the Lantau Group, and one of the report's lead authors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of pretty obvious, and yet we're still seeing parties wanting to pursue the increasing scale of production of such things,\" he told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office President Trump has sought to boost fossil fuel production and roll back US commitments to fight climate change, calling for the country to be a global energy superpower with cheap and reliable resources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also sought to get the US courts to overturn the idea that carbon dioxide is a danger to public health.  His government has also followed up with efforts to restrict or limit the efforts of international bodies that set out to tackle warming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year has seen efforts at <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgpddpldleo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">international plastics negotiations</a>, at the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3vnl0yxg53o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">international maritime organisation</a> and during <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp84m16mdm1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">COP30</a> to strike out language that states that climate change is a major issue requiring the world to move away rapidly from fossil fuels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The disagreement over the Global Environment Outlook report will raise concerns about future negotiations for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports as these studies are seen as the bedrock of global efforts to limit global warming.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

an issue which Trump has at times characterised as a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\" perpetrated by Democrats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also followed complaints from US farmers after they lost access to customers in China as a result of Trump's trade policies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, China is the world's biggest market for soybeans and has in recent decades been a major buyer from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Beijing effectively shut the door on American soybean imports for months after Trump hit Chinese goods with new levies earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\" he posted on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Soybean farmer in Illinois in October 2025, getting onto a large agricultural threshing vehicle. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">China is the largest export destination for US soybeans. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Legan, a livestock, corn and soybean farmer in Putnam County, Indiana, told the BBC that the government aid would \"help our bottom line\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As crop prices have fallen and profitability has plummeted, he could use the funds to help replace tractors and other machinery - investments he has put on hold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his first administration, Trump also provided aid packages to farmers, including $22bn in 2019 and another $46bn in a 2020 package that also included relief from the Covid pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Legan said he believed the new package would be similar to what he received during the first Trump term, in that it would not resolve persistent cost pressures and shrinking export markets, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is still that we have high costs of production,\" Mr Legan said, pointing to record high prices for crop protection chemicals and seeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While some markets have opened up, we're still not back to exporting as much ag products as we have in the past,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Illinois farmer, Brad Smith, heard news of the $12bn package while at the Illinois Farm Bureau State Convention in Chicago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"None of us really love it, but we're not in a position where we can be turning it down,\" he said. \"We hope we can reduce the need for anything like this going forward.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If he does receive funds from the government, the money will likely be in his hands for three days, he said, before spending it to clear outstanding bills and hopefully buy seeds, chemicals and fertilisers for next year's crop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Smith said that distributing government aid to farmers who need it the most, rather than to larger farms, has been a challenge in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, the White House said China had committed to buying at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans by the end of 2025, followed by 25 million metric tonnes annually for the next three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, China has only purchased approximately one-quarter of that amount. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those purchases, however, have accelerated, and Bessent told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that China is likely to meet the goal by the end of February. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why a farm aid package was necessary, Bessent said \"the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are going to create this bridge because... agriculture is all about the future,\" he said. \"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, he signed an executive order creating food supply chain security \"task forces\" and assessing \"anti-competitive behaviour\" in the agricultural sector.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-peter-hoskins\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Peter Hoskins</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Inside, the lower floor of the Federal-style mansion is decorated in the spirit of the home's original era.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The compound, which reportedly has five bedrooms, also has enhanced security to protect the mayor and their family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some residents have alleged that Gracie Mansion also has supernatural lodgers. Chirlane McCray, the wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, told reporters that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams was more certain. \"I don't care what anyone says,\" he declared in 2022. \"There are ghosts in there, man.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's current apartment is rent stabilised, meaning the city sets limits on how much landlords can raise the rent each year. New Yorkers consider these apartments valuable lifelines as the cost of housing outpaces what many can afford.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Records showed Mamdani paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month for his apartment. According to the real estate platform Zillow, the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount Skydance has made another offer to buy Warner Bros Discovery as it seeks to trump a rival plan from Netflix to buy the company's studio and streaming networks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, said it was making a direct offer to shareholders of $30 (£22.50) per share to scoop up the whole of Warner Bros, including its traditional television networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said its proposal was a \"superior alternative\" to Netflix's, delivering more cash upfront to shareholders and greater prospect of approval by regulators. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump has said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn815egjqjpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"there could be a problem\" with Netflix's purchase</a>, pointing to competition concerns given the size of the companies. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount is a smaller player than Netflix that is known for brands such as CBS News, Nickelodeon and Mission Impossible. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It started submitting offers a few months ago, eventually prompting Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wall Street analysts have long said they believe a Paramount-Warner Bros combination makes sense, because it would give the company the scale to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Disney. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount was also seen as a strong suitor because the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, was expected to help ease the approval process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of the auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn (£62.3bn), including its debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix executives on Monday expressed confidence in their plans, dismissing Paramount's attempt as \"entirely expected\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros said it would review the offer but was not currently changing its recommendation. It said it would respond within 10 business days. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump says he will be \"involved\" in the Warner Brothers merger decision</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Either<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>takeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts said Netflix's plan would likely raise concerns about dominance in streaming, while Paramount's proposal would prompt a review of the impact on advertisers and local television distributors, given the power of a combined company over sports and children's networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president said over the weekend he expected to be involved in the approval process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has offered little certainty about his views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While noting potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up on Sunday, he also praised the streamer's bosses. Meanwhile on social media on Monday, he took aim at Paramount for a 60 Minutes interview that it aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC, Paramount chief executive David Ellison said he had had \"great conversations\" with Trump about the deal, while noting that he did not want to speak for the president. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Ellison's plan would build on his purchase earlier this year of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,\" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, calling the Warner Bros assets simply \"nice to have\" for the streamer.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr Ellison talked up the benefits of his plan for the entire media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,\" he said. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Netflix executives, who spoke at a business conference on Monday, said they were confident their takeover could win approval, noting that their plan does not include plans for major cuts.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in Warner Bros rose more than 4% on Monday while Paramount shares jumped 9%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in Netflix, however, dropped more than 3%.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

US immigration officials could not \"confirm or deny a flight\" for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first deportation flight took off from the US in late September, in a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US. Many Iranian nationals say they come to the US because they fear persecution at home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Father Joseph Bach, a member of Borderland Companions of Hope, a Franciscan organisation that provides support to migrants, said he has been informed through his contacts inside an Arizona detention facility that Christian converts were among those removed. He also said some detainees had identified as LGBT.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christian converts and members of the LGBT community are groups that face severe legal and social repercussions in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Father Joseph called the deportations \"the most unchristian thing to do\", adding, \"It's scary, it concerns me, it is not OK. I call this a death flight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities have facilitated the repatriation efforts. An Iranian consular official said the deported nationals had \"announced their willingness for return following continuation of anti-immigration and discriminative policy against foreign nationals, particularly Iranians, by the United States\", the Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan News Agency reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one detainee who spoke with the BBC said not all those who were deported were willing to return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person who was on a list for potential deportation told the BBC he and his partner crossed into the US on foot from Mexico earlier this year. Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Arizona, he said he feared for his life if he returned to Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest deportations come as already severely strained relations between the two countries further deteriorated in June, after the US bombed Iran's nuclear facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The removals highlight the US government's hardline immigration posture under President Donald Trump, who made border security and reducing unauthorised migration central to his political agenda.</p></div></div></body></html>"

to protect the public from deceptive business practices and unfair competition - Congress passed a law saying a president could only remove commissioners for cause and that the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump appointed Ms Slaughter in 2018 to fill a Democratic position on the FTC, and she was later reappointed by former President Joe Biden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar firing rules exist for other independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law was put to the test in 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to remove a member of the FTC, leading the Supreme Court to uphold the independence of certain federal agencies like the trade commission.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court found that, while the president has the ability to remove executive officers without cause, such a power does not apply to agencies like the FTC that are \"neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During oral arguments on Monday, the four conservative justices on the court appeared to disagree with Ms Slaughter's lawyers' arguments that this would be an unacceptable expansion of Trump's powers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arguing for the Trump administration, US Solicitor General John Sauer called the Humphrey's rule an \"indefensible outlier\" and \"decaying husk\" of a Supreme Court decision that should be overturned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" said conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three liberal justices pressed why the court would overturn a 90-year-old precedent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \"and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Justice Elena Kagan suggested that allowing Trump to remove Ms Slaughter could have wide-reaching impacts, asking: \"The question is, where does this lead?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyer Amit Agarwal, representing Ms Slaughter, said independent auditing groups like the FTC  have a long history in US politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court has already issued one ruling against Ms Slaughter, which analysts suggested could indicate how it would ultimately rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A lower court ruled that Ms Slaughter had been illegally removed from the FTC, leading the Trump administration to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a 6-3 decision, the conservative-majority court in September issued an emergency order maintaining her firing until the case could be heard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Supreme Court is also set to take up at a later date a separate case on whether Trump had the power to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

eZyhnA\">They arrived in the Niger state capital, Minna, in a fleet of minibuses escorted by military vans and armoured vehicles, and were received by Governor Umar Bago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details about their release remain unclear, including whether it was secured through negotiation or by force, and whether any ransoms were paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, more than 250 students and 12 staff were kidnapped from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, the latest in a wave of mass abductions.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has learned that the rescued students will be transported to the school, located more than 300km (186 miles) from the state capital, on Tuesday where they will be reunited with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role in securing their release, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu visited Papiri and met a delegation led by Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, assuring them the children would soon be rescued and reunited with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 153 students and 12 staff members are still with the unknown gunmen.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on St Mary's, on 21 November, was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier: on 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week gunmen abducted at least 20 people in two separate attacks - at a newly established church in central Kogi state, where a pastor, his wife and some worshipers were taken, and in the mostly Muslim northern Sokoto state, where a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments. However, a presidential spokesman <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgj9dd983xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">earlier told the BBC that the government believes they are the work of jihadist groups.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paying of ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria in an attempt to cut the supply of funds to the kidnap gangs but it is widely believed that in many cases money is still handed over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

They are coordinating strikes on Russian positions inside the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The commander of the Skala Assault Regiment, Yuri, is keen to prove to us that Ukraine still controls the north of the city - to show that the Kremlin's claim that it has taken Pokrovsk is a lie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the radio, they ask two of their soldiers to break cover from a building to display a Ukrainian flag. They move quickly to avoid being spotted. The drone feed shows the moment they briefly wave their yellow and blue flag, before quickly returning to cover.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9851/live/ec410470-d4d2-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Matthew Goddard Sasha talks to colleagues in Pokrovsk from his command centre\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Matthew Goddard</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Battalion commanders are adamant they still have a foothold in Pokrovsk</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yuri tells me: \"You've now seen it with your own eyes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the whole world should know we will not just give up our territory,\" he says. \"If we do not show this, everyone will lose faith and stop helping Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The battle for Pokrovsk, once a key logistics hub for Ukraine's military, has been grinding on for nearly 18 months.

A Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Rabbit shows me passports and documents retrieved from their dead. I asked him if he thinks they have killed a lot of Russians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not enough,\" he replies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rabbit described the situation as \"hard, but under control\". He shows me a Russian machine gun captured by one of his comrades who spent 70 straight days fighting in Pokrovsk. \"All he wanted was cigarettes and ammunition,\" says Rabbit.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fighting is clearly taking its toll on Ukrainian forces, but there is no sign of them giving up. Nor does Rabbit agree with any suggestion that Ukraine should give up more land for peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says too much blood has already been spilt: \"We are part of this land. If we give it up Russia will want more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another soldier - call sign \"Ghost\" - fighting in another unit in Pokrovsk describes the situation as \"tense, but not critical\". He dismisses reports of its capture as \"Russian propaganda\", saying reports that \"Pokrovsk is surrounded is fake information\", but adds that \"everyone is exhausted – both Russia and Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ukraine, holding ground is also proving costly. The Skala Regiment shares recent videos taken by their troops on the front line - often having to take cover in buildings from Russian drones. The buzz of an approaching drone is often accompanied by heavy automatic fire as they try to bring it down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Khotabych\", who recently spent a month fighting in the city, says it is scary when the drones spot you: \"There are lots and they fly round the clock.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Russians have more drones with thermal imaging cameras, which can see at night. Khotabych said he and his men always hope for \"good weather\" – by which he means fog, rain and grey sky. In other words, anything that makes it more difficult to fly.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Matthew Goddard A man in a Ukrainian uniform with a balaclava and cap\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Matthew Goddard</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Skala Regiment's deputy commander, \"Godfather\", warns that Putin will not stop after Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Pokrovsk, Ukrainian soldiers are focused on the fighting, not peace talks.

the Economic Community of West African States - of which they had all been founding participants 50 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, faced with the prospect that yet another civilian government might be overturned by discontented soldiers, the presidents of the remaining Ecowas member states rapidly reached the conclusion that the attempted coup in Cotonou could not be allowed to succeed.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Learning from past mistakes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having fought off early morning putschist attacks on Talon's home and the presidency offices, loyalist forces had already reaffirmed government control across the city, locking down the main central administrative district. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was proving hard to break down the last-ditch resistance of rebel troops who had shown they were ready to use lethal force without regard for civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, Benin's eastern neighbour and much the largest military power in the region, authorised air strikes, while Ecowas leaders decided to despatch ground troops the same day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those sending forces is Ghana's President John Mahama, who leads a resilient democracy but has made friendly diplomatic overtures to the Sahelian military regimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In acting so quickly, Ecowas has perhaps learned a lesson from its misjudged response to the 2023 coup in Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On that occasion it was not practically organised to intervene militarily in the hours after the elected head of state, Mohamed Bazoum, had been detained by coup leaders – the only moment, perhaps, when a rapid commando raid to rescue him and secure key buildings might have had any chance of success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time the bloc had threatened intervention and begun to plan it, the chance had gone: the new junta had consolidated control over the Nigérien army and mobilised popular opinion in its support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Faced with the prospect of intervention becoming full-scale war, and under strong domestic popular pressure to avoid any such bloodbath, Ecowas leaders backed off - opting to rely on sanctions. And when those also proved counter-productive, they settled for the diplomatic path alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time around, in Benin, the situation was quite different: Talon was still in full control, even if some would-be putschists were still resisting. So he, as the internationally recognised president, could legitimately request support from fellow member countries in the regional bloc.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this seems to have had popular support in Cotonou.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Béninois citizens do have grievances against the current government, notably over the exclusion of Les Démocrates, the main opposition party, from the forthcoming presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is a strong culture in Benin of trying to achieve change through political and civil society action, rather than force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Béninois are rightly proud of their country's role as the pioneering instigator of the wave of peaceful mass protest and democratisation that swept across francophone Africa in the early 1990s.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8338/live/a1de4f10-d418-11f0-aae0-a150da5fcfef.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BTV Benin soldiers dressed in army uniform appearing on national tv to announce suspension of the country’s constitution.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BTV</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most of the soldiers who appeared on state TV early on Sunday morning are on the run</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the complaints against Talon aired by the would-be putschists during their brief appearance on national television are widely shared, there has been absolutely no sign of any popular support for their attempt to get rid of the government by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So Benin represented a particularly favourable context for a forceful Ecowas intervention in defence of constitutional civilian rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, if anything, the coup plotters are likely to become the target of growing public anger as news of casualties circulates.

Even where economies are growing, there is a desperate shortage of jobs and viable livelihoods for the region's rapidly growing young population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, while the regional context is widely shared, the driving factors for the coups are often local - specific to each country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of popular support for the Cotonou putschists stands in stark contrast to the mood on the streets of Conakry, the capital of <b id=\"guinea\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea</b>, in September 2021, when the special forces commander, Col Mamady Doumbouya led the overthrow of then-President Alpha Condé.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Talon, Condé had first been democratically elected but later secured re-election in questionable conditions, and presided over a significant erosion of political freedoms. Yet in Guinea, Condé had presided over violent abuse on a far greater scale than in Benin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition, Condé had then strong-armed his way to a third term aged 83. In contrast the 67-year-old Talon has promised to step down next April, albeit having adjusted the electoral rules to almost guarantee an easy victory for his chosen successor, Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key difference is Condé's deeply disappointing economic track record, whereas Talon has presided over strong growth and improving services.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: People in Benin felt 'total fear' at attempted coup</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Further north, the wave of coups in the Sahelian countries in recent years were also driven by local conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"mali\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Mali </b>and <b id=\"burkina-faso\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Burkina Faso</b>, military commanders had grown frustrated with the weak leadership elected presidents were providing in the campaign against Islamist insurgents. In both countries, troops had repeatedly suffered brutal losses while their <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62052598\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">civilian governments appeared incapable of mobilising the extra weapons or sometimes even food</a> that the troops needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also deep resentment at France's inability to bring the jihadists to heel, despite the high-tech weaponry at the disposal of its forces then deployed across the Sahel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also in Mali, some nationalist sections of political and military opinion were frustrated with the functioning of a 2015 peace agreement with former Tuareg separatists in the far north, overseen by UN troops. Hardliners even accused French forces of actively preventing Bamako from deploying national army units to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"niger\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Niger</b>, the circumstances surrounding the 2023 putsch were equally distinctive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bazoum's political support had been eroded by his very publicly close partnership with France, and particularly his request that Paris provide troops to defend the north-western border from incursions by Mali-based jihadists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, his vocal support for judges probing a corruption scandal in defence procurement also risked alienating powerful elements of the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coup that followed soon afterwards in <b id=\"gabon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Gabon</b>, in August 2023, was similarly the product of local frustrations. In this case the opaque management of election results that saw an implausible victory awarded to President Ali Bongo, in frail health after a slow recovery from a stroke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, circumstances vary widely. And recent events confirm the trend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The region certainly does face a real crisis of security and, in many countries, politics or development too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But national conditions are often the major driver for each upheaval or coup attempt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many suspect the military takeover in <b id=\"guinea-bissau\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea-Bissau</b> aimed to forestall a possible opposition election victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whereas the Benin rebels seem to have been motivated by a mix of army grievances, and broader political and economic complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they strikingly misjudged the popular appetite in Cotonou for any violent or radical system change.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvd01g2kwwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">National Security Strategy published on Friday</a>, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services is common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The phenomenon picked up just before the pandemic in 2020, when north-eastern <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.epw.in/journal/2022/26-27/commentary/revaluing-unpaid-work.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Assam </a>rolled out a scheme for vulnerable women. Since then these transfers have turned into a political juggernaut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent wave of unconditional cash transfers targets adult women, with some states acknowledging their unpaid domestic and care work. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZqvIm1YsEnQNjO8KfzMoNwjH7m9jRfJ/view\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tamil Nadu</a> frames its payments as a \"rights grant\" while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/lbs-wb\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">West Bengal's</a> scheme similarly recognises women's unpaid contributions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other states, the recognition is implicit: policymakers expect women to use the transfers for household and family welfare, say experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This focus on women's economic role has also shaped politics: in 2021, Tamil actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan promised \"salaries for housewives\". (His fledgling party lost.) By 2024, pledges of women-focused cash transfers helped deliver victories to political parties in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the recent elections in Bihar, the political power of cash transfers was on stark display. In the weeks before polling in the country's poorest state, the government transferred 10,000 rupees ($112; £85) to 7.5 million female bank accounts under a livelihood-generation scheme. Women voted in larger numbers than men, decisively shaping the outcome. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics called it blatant vote-buying, but the result was clear: women helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition secure a landslide victory. Many believe this cash infusion was a reminder of how financial support can be used as political leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Bihar is only one piece of a much larger picture. Across India, unconditional cash transfers are reaching tens of millions of women on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maharashtra alone promises benefits for 25 million women; Odisha's scheme reaches 71% of its female voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some policy circles, the schemes are derided as vote-buying freebies. They also put pressure on state finances: 12 states are set to spend around $18bn on such payouts this fiscal year.  A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prsindia.org/files/budget/budget_state_finance_report/2025/SOSF-2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report</a> by  think-tank PRS Legislative Research notes that half of these states face revenue deficits - this happens when a state borrows to pay regular expenses without creating assets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many argue they also reflect a slow recognition of something India's feminists have argued for decades: the economic value of unpaid domestic and care work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women in India spent nearly five hours a day on such work in 2024 - more than 7.6 times the time spent by men, according to the latest Time Use Survey.

Most used it for food, education and medical costs; hardly transformative, but the regularity offered security and a sense of agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More detailed work by Prof Kotiswaran and colleagues shows mixed outcomes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Assam, most women spent the money on essentials; many appreciated the dignity it afforded, but few linked it to recognition of unpaid work, and most would still prefer paid jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tamil Nadu, women getting the money spoke of peace of mind, reduced marital conflict and newfound confidence - a rare social dividend. In Karnataka, beneficiaries reported eating better, gaining more say in household decisions and wanting higher payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet only a sliver understood the scheme as compensation for unpaid care work; messaging had not travelled. Even so, women said the money allowed them to question politicians and manage emergencies. Across studies, the majority of women had full control of the cash.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The evidence shows that the cash transfers are tremendously useful for women to meet their own immediate needs and those of their households. They also restore dignity to women who are otherwise financially dependent on their husbands for every minor expense,\" Prof Kotiswaran says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Importantly, none of the surveys finds evidence that the money discourages women from seeking paid work or entrench gender roles - the two big feminist fears, according to a report by Prof Kotiswaran along with Gale Andrew and Madhusree Jana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor have they reduced women's unpaid workload, the researchers find. They do, however, strengthen financial autonomy and modestly strengthen bargaining power. They are neither panacea nor poison: they are useful but limited tools, operating in a patriarchal society where cash alone cannot undo structural inequities.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Swastik Pal Women at a cash transfer camp in West Bengal\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Swastik Pal</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Women welcome the dignity the cash transfers provide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What next? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emerging research offers clear hints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eligibility rules should be simplified, especially for women doing heavy unpaid care work. Transfers should remain unconditional and independent of marital status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But messaging should emphasise women's rights and the value of unpaid work, and financial-literacy efforts must deepen, researchers say. And cash transfers cannot substitute for employment opportunities; many women say what they really want is work that pays and respect that endures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the transfers are coupled with messaging on the recognition of women's unpaid work, they could potentially disrupt the gendered division of labour when paid employment opportunities become available,\" says Prof Kotiswaran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's quiet cash transfers revolution is still in its early chapters. But it already shows that small, regular sums - paid directly to women - can shift power in subtle, significant ways. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether this becomes a path to empowerment or merely a new form of political patronage will depend on what India chooses to build around the money.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It would let users build their own public squares without the traditional gatekeepers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was that heady optimism phase when I first joined and I think a lot of the world shared that,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time he left the firm in 2017, seeds of doubt about its work had been planted, and they've since bloomed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's lots of good things about these platforms, but there's just too much bad stuff,\" he surmises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's no longer an uncommon view as scrutiny of the largest social media companies has increased around the globe. A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,\" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,\" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Whistleblowers, lawsuits and questions</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images (L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC. \n\nThey are all in black suits and seated in a row at a table. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">(L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2875013eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">both been ordered to testify in person</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the wellbeing of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram face-altering beauty filters which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meta maintains the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers</a> who monitor its platforms for misinformation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,\" Zuckerberg said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Public scrutiny and private lobbying</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,\" Mr Scheeler says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And many argued government is overstepping.

Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects.

It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel dismissed it, however.

It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib.

Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality is that IS in Syria is weak.

I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards.

He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol.

Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, faced for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It built on already existing discriminatory legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regime was enforced through violence and repression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing \"race quotas\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05gnyzgd6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A new law this year</a> does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up.

Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly?

This is the light of hope for us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare system</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Alaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurant</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans.

There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first.

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.

Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Try to remain civil'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
