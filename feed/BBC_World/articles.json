Sharaa, their leader, had a long history fighting for al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he had been imprisoned by the Americans, and then was a senior commander with the group that became Islamic State.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, as he built his power base in Syria, he broke with and fought both IS and al-Qaeda. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People who had travelled to Idlib to see him said that he had developed a much more pragmatic set of beliefs, better suited to governing Syria, with its spectrum of religious sects.

He told me that the country was exhausted by war and was not a threat to its neighbours or to the West, insisting that they would govern for all Syrians. It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel dismissed it, however.

My formal attire was back at home in London. After the interview one of his aides complained that I should have worn a suit to interview a national leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His grumble was about more than my sartorial choices. It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib. The campaign was designed to present him as a man who had outgrown his jihadist roots to become a worthy leader of all Syria, a leader the rest of the world should take seriously and treat with respect.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A weakened IS in Syria</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sharaa took power amid huge uncertainty about what he might do, and what might be done to him by his enemies. Among them were dark fears that jihadist extremists of the Islamic State, still existing in sleeper cells, could try to kill him, or cause chaos with mass casualty attacks in Damascus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jihadists rage on social media about Sharaa's charm offensive in the west. After he agreed to join the US-led coalition against Islamic State, prominent voices online branded him an apostate, a Muslim who had turned on his own religion. Extremists could take that as a licence to kill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality is that IS in Syria is weak.

month</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 100 children who were abducted from a Catholic school in central Nigeria last month have been freed, authorities say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Niger state's police chief, Adamu Abdullahi Elleman, and Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who is in charge of the school as the local leader of the Catholic community, both told the BBC that they had received confirmation of the students' release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said the government's Office of the National Security Adviser had informed them that the children would be reunited with their parents from Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 250 students and 12 staff were kidnapped from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, the latest in a wave of mass abductions which has sent shockwaves through the nation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details about the release of the 100 schoolchildren remain unclear, including whether it was secured through negotiation or by force, and whether any ransoms were paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role in securing their release, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu visited Papiri and met a delegation led by Bishop Yohanna, assuring them the children would soon be rescued and reunited with their families.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on St Mary's, on 21 November, was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier: on 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week gunmen abducted at least 20 people in two separate attacks - at a newly established church in central Kogi state, where a pastor, his wife and some worshipers were taken, and in the mostly Muslim northern Sokoto state, where a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments. However, a presidential spokesman <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgj9dd983xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">earlier told the BBC that the government believes they are the work of jihadist groups.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paying of ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria in an attempt to cut the supply of funds to the kidnap gangs but it is widely believed that in many cases money is still handed over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to \"dominate\" Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US \"threats\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The carrier was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0keyern0do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked</a> after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.</p></div></div></body></html>"

welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 33-page document, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04vdengk3do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">unveiled by the US administration this week</a>, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship

The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards - and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent.

The question asks applicants to identify Trump policy initiatives that are significant to them, and to describe how they personally would advance Trump's agenda. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has long that said loyalty is the most important thing to him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I value loyalty above everything else - more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy,\" he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=qJ_ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=I+value+loyalty+above+everything+else%E2%80%94more+than+brains,+more+than+drive,+and+more+than+energy&amp;dq=I+value+loyalty+above+everything+else%E2%80%94more+than+brains,+more+than+drive,+and+more+tha\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">once said</a>.  </p></div></div></body></html>"

Those without a  pass will now pay $100 per person, in addition to the standard entrance fee, at 11 of the most visited parks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump's leadership always puts American families first,\" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,\" Burgum's statement continued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In May, the department estimated in its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.doi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025-06/fy26bibentire-book508060125_0.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">budget proposal</a> for 2026 fiscal year that surcharges for foreign visitors would bring in more than $90 million per year.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the first time the Trump administration has targeted Juneteenth and MLK Jr Day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On his first day in office this year, Trump issued an executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programmes from federal agencies, which led many agencies to bar celebrations of holidays seen as DEI-related, including MLK Jr Day and Juneteenth. However, the two dates remain national holidays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June, the Trump administration held a military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the US Army's 250th anniversary, which also happened to fall on both Flag Day and Trump's birthday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

Cameras positioned at the entrance track his every move, while reams of barbed wire surround the farm in the rural Free State province in the heart of South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It feels like a prison,\" he says as the gates clank shut behind him. \"If they want to come and kill us they can. At least it will take them time to get to me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fear of being attacked is very real for the white Afrikaner, who manages a farm with his wife and two young daughters. He did not want us to use his full name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His grandfather and his wife's grandfather were both murdered in farm attacks, and he lives a two-hour drive from where the body of 21-year-old farm manager Brendan Horner was discovered five years ago, tied to a pole, with a rope around his neck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marthinus says he can't take a chance with his own family and, in February, they applied for refugee status in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm prepared to do that to get a better life for my wife and children.

Nobody deserves a life like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Violent crime in South Africa is endemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest crime figures released in November for the first quarter of 2025 show there was an average of 63 murders every day. While this was a decrease on the same period in 2024, South Africa's homicide rate remains one of the highest in the world. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Thabo Makopo is also worried about being targeted by criminals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Black farmers are also victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the outskirts of Ficksburg, a town at the foot of Free State's Imperani Mountain, Thabo Makopo has a small farm of 237 acres (96 hectares), where he tends sheep and cattle. Like Marthinus, the 45-year-old says farm attacks are his biggest problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are young men. They are armed and dangerous. Whether they will lose their life or take yours, they are going to take those livestock,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thabo believes all farmers in the province, regardless of their race, are at risk of attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's all of us. I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards. That is more than the police and army combined.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Morgan Barrett rejects the idea that there is a white genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many farmers, like Morgan Barrett, who is white, employ their own security guards, if they can afford it. He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol. Between Morgan and his neighbours, they are out almost every night. Six of his cattle were stolen the previous week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can call the police, and they may turn up two or three hours later, by which time the thieves will have run away,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Thabo, he doesn't believe he is targeted because of the colour of his skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand ($1,200; £880) sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about what he thinks of people claiming there is a \"white genocide\" in South Africa, he says he thinks they \"have no real understanding of what a genocide is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What happened in Rwanda is genocide. What is happening to white farmers is very bad, but I don't think you can call it genocide.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-at-19:00-on-bbc-two\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye at 19:00 on BBC Two</i></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has repeated the widely disputed claims there is a genocide against white farmers, while South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, has accused South African politicians of \"actively promoting\" a genocide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government here has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other white South Africans are being persecuted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country does not release crime figures based on race, but in May, in order to debunk these claims, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu gave a breakdown of killings on farms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mchunu said that between October 2024 and March 2025, there were 18 farm murders across South Africa. Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, faced for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It built on already existing discriminatory legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regime was enforced through violence and repression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing \"race quotas\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05gnyzgd6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A new law this year</a> does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up.

Almost 500 were later found dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Robot caregivers and AI</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fujitsu's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Lineup of Sharp Poketomo robots at Ceatec in Chiba, Japan\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jaltson-akkanath-chummar\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It said thanks for verifying your age,\" Isobel claims. \"I've heard someone used Beyoncé's face,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I texted her,\" she gestures to her mum Mel, \"and I was like, 'Hey Mummy, I got past the social media ban' and she was just like, 'Oh, you monkey'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It made her laugh, Mel explains: \"This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though she had let Isobel use TikTok and Snapchat with tight supervision – preferring that to the teenager using it covertly – she had been hoping the ban, as promised, would help parents like her protect their children from the dangers of the online world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That hope has now wavered, as a series of experts – and kids themselves – sound the alarm on the viability and safety of the landmark policy, which is being closely watched around the globe and eyed with trepidation by some of its most influential companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's concern about the reliability of the technology enforcing the ban, along with fears it could isolate vulnerable children and push others into darker, less-regulated corners of the web.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The question nervously being asked in the halls of Canberra, in households across the nation, and in tech boardrooms around the world: is this actually going to work?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Parents are worried sick about the safety of kids online'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You'd struggle to find anyone in Australia who feels social media companies are doing enough to shield users – particularly children – from harm on their platforms. Their protestations to the contrary fall on unsympathetic ears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have zero faith the tech companies will do anything other than protect their profits,\" Dany Elachi, a father of five and anti-smartphone campaigner, tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They've had ample opportunity to show they take children's wellbeing seriously and they've failed at every turn.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Detailing how bullying – inescapable due to social media – had culminated in her 15-year-old daughter's suicide, Emma Mason asked world leaders at the UN last month: \"How many more Tillys must die?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pair were among the parents and public figures who lent their voices to a headline-grabbing national campaign calling for a new minimum age for social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some experts, including Australia's online safety tsar, warned banning children from social media was not the solution, but their concerns were swept away by a tide of parental passion and political pressure.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What do teenagers think about Australia's social media ban?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November 2024, the prime minister announced the legislation, promising parents and children wouldn't be penalised. It'd be up to the platforms to take \"reasonable steps\" to ensure account-holders were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to $49.5m (US$33m, £25m) for the most serious breaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This one is for the mums and dads...

Alphabet, which owns YouTube and Google, is also apparently considering its own challenge. Human rights groups and a smattering of legal experts have raised their hackles too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the government has insisted the social media companies have the money and the technology to make the ban happen, it has at the same time sought to manage expectations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through.

Facebook, for example, has systems which set off alarms bells if an adult is messaging a child frequently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're not stopping behaviour, you're just moving that behaviour to other platforms,\" says Tim Levy, head of online safety company Qoria and one of the trial advisers who quit. \"Telling the concerned Australian parents that it's all good now is a very dangerous message.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The science on social media and health is complex and still evolving too.

This is the light of hope for us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare system</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Alaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurant</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans.

There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first.

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.

Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Try to remain civil'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
