If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,\" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Asked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: \"I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance. </p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.\"</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Clearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: \"Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.\"</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: \"There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"
