Two others were killed, including a freelance journalist, the broadcaster said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's military said it targeted Sharif, alleging he had \"served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas\" - something Sharif denied. Israel provided little evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC understands Sharif did some work with a Hamas media team in Gaza before the current conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In social media posts before his death, the journalist is heard criticising Hamas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Media rights groups and countries including Qatar condemned the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said the UK government was \"gravely concerned\" and called for an independent investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to reporters, Starmer's official spokesman said Israel should ensure journalists can work safely and report without fear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The funerals of Sharif, fellow Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa took place on Monday following the targeted missile strike on their tent in Gaza City. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammad al-Khaldi was named by medics at al-Shifa hospital as the sixth journalist who was killed during the strike, Reuters news agency reported. Another person was also killed in the attack, it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Streets in Gaza were thronged with crowds gathered for the funerals. Anas al-Sharif was a household name who had millions of followers online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reporters Without Borders, a media freedom group, strongly condemned what it called the assassination of Sharif.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Foreign Press Association said it was outraged by the targeted killing. It said the Israeli military had repeatedly labelled Palestinian journalists \"as militants, often without verifiable evidence\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was appalled by the attack and that Israel had failed to provide evidence to back up its allegations against Sharif.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Israel has a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof,\" the organisation added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military has suggested it has documents found in Gaza that confirmed Sharif belonged to Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It said these include \"personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories and salary documents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The only materials that have been released for publication are screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives, and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC cannot independently verify these documents, and has seen no evidence of Sharif having involvement in the current war or remaining an active member of Hamas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No Israeli explanation has so far been given for the killing of the entire Al Jazeera news crew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">CPJ says at least 186 journalists have been killed since the start of Israel's military offensive in Gaza in October 2023 - the deadliest period for journalists since it began recording such data in 1992.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Israel must respect &amp; protect all civilians, including journalists,\" the UN Human Rights office said in a post on X. \"We call for immediate, safe and unhindered access to Gaza for all journalists.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month, the BBC and three other news agencies - Reuters, AP and AFP - issued <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8j1j7n72ywo#:~:text=The%20full%20statement%20reads%3A%20%22We,on%20the%20ground%20in%20Gaza.\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">a joint statement expressing</a> \"desperate concern\" for journalists in the Gaza Strip, who they say are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli government does not allow international news organisations, including the BBC, into Gaza to report freely, so many outlets rely on Gaza-based reporters for coverage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile in Gaza, five more people have died from malnutrition in the past 24 hours, including one child, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This brings the total number of malnutrition deaths to 222, including 101 children, the health ministry said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian agency said on Friday that the amount of aid entering Gaza continues to be \"far below the minimum required to meet people's immense needs\". Last month, UN-backed global food security experts warned the \"worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has continued to deny there is starvation in Gaza and has accused UN agencies of not picking up aid at the borders and delivering it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian agency has said it continues to see impediments and delays as it tries to collect aid from Israeli-controlled border zones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, 61,430 people have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israel's military campaign, according to the health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hospital officials named Mohammed al-Khaldi, a local freelance journalist, as one of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The targeted attack on a tent used by journalists has drawn strong international condemnation including from the UN, Qatar where Al Jazeera is based, and media freedom groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel says Sharif was \"the head of a Hamas terrorist cell\" but has produced little evidence to support that. Sharif previously denied it, and Al Jazeera and media rights groups have rejected the allegation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC understands Sharif worked for a Hamas media team in Gaza before the current conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In some of his social media posts before his death, the journalist can be heard criticising Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Committee for the Protection of Journalists CEO Jodie Ginsberg told the BBC there was no justification for Sharif's killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"International law is very clear on this point that the only individuals who are legitimate targets during a war are active combatants. Having worked as a media advisor for Hamas, or indeed for Hamas currently, does not make you an active combatant\", she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"And nothing that the Israeli forces has produced so far in terms of evidence gives us any kind of assurance that he was even an active member of Hamas.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The 'only voice' left in Gaza City</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bafc/live/8979bca0-76aa-11f0-8155-5f8739f897b4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt='AFP via Getty Images Anas al-Sharif stands wearing a \"press\" vest and holding a helmet in one hand as he surveys the destruction done to buildings around him in Gaza City.

Hours before he himself was killed, he posted about an intense Israeli bombardment of Gaza City. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohamed Moawad, Al Jazeera's managing editor, described him as the \"only voice left in Gaza City\" - which Israel now plans to militarily occupy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Raed Fakih, input manager at Al Jazeera's Arabic-language channel, told the BBC Sharif was \"courageous, dedicated, and honest - that's what made him successful as a journalist with hundreds of thousands of social media followers from all over the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fakih, who is in charge of the channel's bureaux and correspondents, added: \"His dedication took him to areas where no other reporter ventured to go, especially those that witnessed the worst massacres. His integrity kept him true to his message as a journalist.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fakih said he spoke to Sharif many times on the phone throughout the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In our last conversations, he told me about the famine and starvation he was enduring, about how hard it is to survive with so little food,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He felt he had no choice but to amplify the voice of the Gazans. He was living the same hardships they are living now, suffering from famine, mourning loved ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"His father was killed in an Israeli bombing. In that way, he was like all Gazans: carrying loss, pain, and resilience. And even in the face of death, he persisted, because this is a story that must be told.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammed Qreieh, 33, was a father of two from Gaza City, the Associated Press news agency reported. Like Sharif, he was separated from his family for months during the war as he reported from the front lines in northern Gaza, AP added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Qreieh's last live broadcast was on Sunday evening, minutes before he was targeted, Al Jazeera Arabic reported.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Israel alleges Sharif led 'terrorist cell', with little evidence</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military accused Sharif of posing as a journalist, saying he had \"served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas\" and was responsible for launching rocket attacks at Israelis - but it has produced little evidence to support these claims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement, the IDF said it had documents which \"unequivocally prove\" his \"military affiliation\" with Hamas, including \"personnel rosters, lists of terrorist training courses, phone directories, and salary documents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has publicly released some screenshots of spreadsheets apparently listing Hamas operatives from the northern Gaza Strip, noting injuries to Hamas operatives and a section of what is said to be a phone directory for the armed group's East Jabalia battalion. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel had previously accused Sharif of being a member of Hamas's military wing - something he and his employer strongly denied. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a media freedom group, said the allegations against him were \"baseless\" and called on the international community to intervene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Without strong action from the international community to stop the Israeli army... we're likely to witness more such extrajudicial murders of media professionals,\" RSF said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly 200 journalists have been killed in the war Israel launched in response to Hamas's October 7, 2023 assault, according to RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fakih from Al Jazeera accused the Israeli military of fabricating stories about journalists before killing them, to \"hide what [it] is committing in Gaza\". Israel has previously denied targeting journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He described this as a \"longstanding pattern\" and referred to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63871856\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla</a>, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military concluded that one of its soldiers probably killed her, but called her death unintentional. Al Jazeera said its evidence showed it was a \"deliberate killing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Here is a crucial fact: had Israel been held accountable for Shireen's assassination, it would not have dared to kill 200 journalists in Gaza,\" said Fakih.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sharif knew he risked being targeted by Israel after its Arabic-language spokesman posted a video of him in July and accused him of being a member of Hamas' military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a post published on his X account, which was prewritten in the event of his death, Sharif said he \"gave every effort and all my strength to be a support and a voice for my people...

It could, he wrote, set a precedent where people do not believe the proceedings will be kept secret, which may discourage witnesses from testifying and jurors from focusing solely on the merits of the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He dismissed the government's argument that much of the information given to the grand jury was made public during her trial, although he agreed that \"a member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial record who reviewed the grand jury materials...would thus learn next to nothing new\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The materials \"do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor\" and \"do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Maxwell, 63, was convicted in December 2019 and was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd049y2qymo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">recently moved</a> from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cy853m9993vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">one of her accusers</a> said outside the court in New York that she should stay in prison for the rest of her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has reached out to Maxwell's lawyers for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month, she was interviewed by justice department officials under the Trump administration's directive to gather and release credible evidence relating to the Epstein case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the campaign trail, Trump pledged to release what are known as \"The Epstein Files\". But this summer the justice department and FBI said they had concluded that Epstein <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2m879neljo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">did not keep a \"client list\"</a> and that the justice department would not be making additional files public. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to the backlash, Trump said Bondi should release \"whatever she thinks is credible\".

These shelters should be equipped with sterilisation and vaccination facilities, as well as CCTV cameras.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court ruled sterilised dogs must not be released in public areas, despite current rules requiring their return to the capture site.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also ordered that a helpline should be set up within a week to report dog bites and rabies cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Animal welfare groups, however, have voiced strong concerns over the court's directive.

In a place where nation, religion and war are linked inextricably with politics and the possession of land, Simcha chose a patch of shade under a fig tree next to a spring of fresh water. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From his dusty car, a small Toyota fitted with off road tyres, he produced a bottle of juice made from fruit and vegetables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Don't worry, there's no extra sugar,\" he said as he poured it into plastic cups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha is the leader of a group of Jewish settlers steadily transforming a big stretch of the rolling terrain south of Hebron in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He moved two large flat stones into the shade as seats, and we sat down in a patch of lush grass, kept alive in the harsh summer heat by water dripping from a pipe coming out of the spring. It was a small oasis at the foot of a steep, arid, rocky slope and the location, if not our conversation, felt peaceful in a way that the West Bank rarely does these days.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea started well over a century ago when Zionists from Europe began to buy land to set up communities in Palestine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has been shaped by significant turning points. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest has come from the deadly 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and Israel's devastating response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The consequences of the last 22 months of war, and however many more months are left before a ceasefire, threaten to spread across years and generations, just like the Middle East war in 1967, when Israel captured Gaza from Egypt and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The scale of destruction and killing in the Gaza war obscures what is happening in the West Bank, which smoulders with tension and violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since October 2023, Israel's pressure on West Bank Palestinians has increased sharply, justified as legitimate security measures.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The enemy in our land lost hope to stay here, says Meir Simcha</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Evidence based on statements by ministers, influential local leaders like Simcha and accounts by witnesses on the ground reveal that the pressure is part of a wider agenda, to accelerate the spread of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to extinguish any lingering hopes of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians and human rights groups also accuse the Israeli security forces of failing in their legal duty as occupiers to protect Palestinians as well as their own citizens - not just turning a blind eye to settler attacks, but even joining in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Violence by ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers in the West Bank has risen sharply since 7 October 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ocha, the UN's humanitarian office, estimates an average of four settler attacks every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The International Court of Justice has issued an advisory opinion that the entire occupation of Palestinian territory captured in 1967 is illegal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel rejects the ICJ's view and claims that the Geneva Conventions forbidding settlement in occupied territories do not apply - a view disputed by many of its own allies as well as international lawyers.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the shade of the fig tree, Simcha denied all suggestions he had attacked Palestinians, as he celebrated the fact that most of the Arab farmers who used to graze their animals on the hills he has seized and tend their olives in the valleys had gone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He looks back to the Hamas October attacks, and Israel's response ever since, as a turning point.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think that a lot has changed, that the enemy in our land lost hope. He's beginning to understand that he's on his way out; that's what has changed in the last year or year and a half.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today you can walk around here in the land in the desert, and nobody will jump on you and try to kill you. There are still attempts to oppose our presence here in this land, but the enemy is starting to understand this slowly. They have no future here. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The reality has changed. I ask you and the people of the world, why are you so interested in those Palestinians so much? Why do you care about them? It's just another small nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Palestinians don't interest me. I care about my people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha says the Palestinians who left villages and farms near the hilltops he has claimed simply realised that God intended the land for Jews, not for them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 24 July this year, a panel of UN experts came to a different conclusion. A statement issued by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said: \"We are deeply troubled by alleged widespread intimidation, violence, land dispossession, destruction of livelihoods and the resulting forcible displacement of communities, and we fear this is severing Palestinians from their land and undermining their food security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The alleged acts of violence, destruction of property, and denial of access to land and resources appear to constitute a systemic pattern of human rights violations.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha has a plan to dig a swimming pool at the base of the spring where we sat to talk. Like many others who are leading the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, he is full of plans. When I met him first, not long after Hamas burst through Israel's border defences on 7 October 2023, he lived in a small group of isolated caravans on a hilltop overlooking the Judean desert as it sweeps down to the Dead Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, Simcha says his community has expanded into around 200 people on three hilltops. He was part of the faction of the settler movement known as hilltop youth, a radical fringe that became notorious for the violent harassment of Palestinians. Most Israelis who have settled in the occupied territories are not like Simcha. They went there not for ideological and religious reasons, but because property was cheaper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now men like Simcha are at the centre of events, with their leaders in the cabinet, leading the charge, married, older, thinking not just about swimming pools for their children but of victory over the Palestinians, once and for all, and everlasting Jewish possession of the land. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha comes across as a happy man. He believes his mission - to implement the will of God by turning the West Bank into a land for Jews, and not for Palestinians - is progressing nicely.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Israel's decades-old project</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's project to settle Jewish citizens in the newly occupied territories started within days of its victory in 1967. Over the last almost 60 years, successive Israeli governments and some wealthy sympathisers have invested vast amounts of money and energy to get to the point where around 700,000 Israeli Jews live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I have been watching the settlements grow for about half of the lifetime of the project, since I first reported from the occupied Palestinian territories in 1991. In that time, the terrain of much of the West Bank has been transformed. The bigger settlements look like small towns, and the West Bank is carved into sections by a network of roads and tunnels built by Israel that are as much about staking an immovable claim to the land as they are about traffic management. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On remote hilltops at night, you can see the lights coming from the caravans of settlers who see themselves as Jewish pioneers. Olive groves, orchards and vineyards owned by Palestinian farmers along the road network are often overgrown, sometimes dotted with piles of rubble left from buildings Israel has demolished. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Controlling the land around the roads is necessary, Israel says, to stop attacks on Jews in the West Bank. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Farmers in areas under settler pressure often need military permission to visit their land, sometimes just once a year.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian farmers going about their business in vans or on donkeys used to be a common sight. In many parts of the West Bank, you just do not see them anymore, especially in places like the settlements east of Shiloh on the road to Nablus, where small groups of shacks and caravans on hilltops have connected up into sprawling residential hubs linked by sinuous road networks.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Motaz Tafsha, mayor of West Bank town Sinjel: \"They want to take our land, and they have the green light\"</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When first I reported on settlements, Israeli leaders would often say that national security depended on them. Enemies lurked across the Jordan valley, and pushing out the frontier, building the land, was a Zionist imperative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like the kibbutz movement of collective farms in the 1920s and 1930s inside present-day Israel, settlements in the occupied territories after 1967 were strategically placed as a first line of defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In this conflict, land is a vital commodity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trading land taken by Israel in 1967 for peace with Palestinians who wanted it for a state was at the heart of the Oslo peace process that ended in violence but provided a false dawn of hope in the 1990s.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were headlines around the world when, after months of secret negotiations in Norway in 1993, there was a handshake on the White House lawn between Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They had signed a declaration of principles that was hoped would lead to the end of the conflict.  Israel would relinquish occupied land to Palestinians. In return, they would drop their claim to territory they had lost when Israel declared independence in 1948. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4097/live/af29d960-75f8-11f0-a447-5383befe7bd7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Cynthia Johnson/Liaison Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shake hands on 13 September, 1993 in Washington DC\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Cynthia Johnson/Liaison</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The argument at the heart of their conflict across the 20th Century, about who controlled land they both wanted, would be solved by splitting it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After a final disastrous summit at Camp David in 2000, the hopes of 1993 were replaced by the deadly violence of a Palestinian uprising and a massive military response from Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Part of the reason why the peace process failed was that other forces, outside the talks, were at work. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas never dropped its belief that the entire land of Palestine was an Islamic possession and used suicide attacks to discredit the notion that peace was possible. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among religious Zionists in Israel, the victory in 1967 had supercharged a wave of messianism - the belief that a divine being was coming who would redeem the Jewish people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It electrified the settler movement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rabin was assassinated in November 1995 by a Jewish extremist brought up in Herzliya on the Mediterranean coast who spent weekends at settlements in the West Bank.

He claims he campaigned to serve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two ministers are very different people to the secular politicians - retired generals like Yigal Allon from the Israeli left and Ariel Sharon from the right - two men who drove the settlement movement forward in its first two decades after 1967.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like Allon and Sharon, they believe that security requires power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But for Smotrich, Ben Gvir and their followers, that is underpinned by the certainty of religious belief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The influence they have acquired in return for supporting Netanyahu and keeping him in power continues to frustrate and enrage secular Israel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Smotrich's Israeli opponents use the word \"messianic\" as term of abuse when they talk about him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Allon and Sharon could be ruthless. After the 1967 war, Allon advocated the annexation of large parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. Neither man believed they were doing the will of God.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas uses religion to justify its violent opposition to the existence of Israel. Religious Zionists in the settler movement believe they are doing God's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Belief in a direct connection with God does not guarantee war.

He is one of Israel's most prominent opponents of the occupation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shaul founded an organisation called Breaking the Silence after, as a soldier, he saw first-hand the inherently brutal realities of a military occupation that has lasted almost 60 years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fellow Israelis have branded supporters of Breaking the Silence, which he no longer leads, as traitors many times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli military crackdowns since the October attacks have reduced Palestinian violence against settlers, while settler attacks on Palestinians have grown sharply.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shaul says that the line between settlers and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has become blurred. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The war in Gaza has required the longest mobilisation of military reservists - the backbone of the IDF - in Israel's history.

This is about Israeli security against terrorism and attacks on Jews.' What do you make of that?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He responds: \"I actually believe that if 7 October taught us one thing it is, if you really care about protecting Israelis and Palestinian life, you need to take care of the root causes of the violence: decades of brutal military occupation, displacement of Palestinians and a conflict that is going on for about 100 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Ultimately, the security protection, the sustainability of Jewish self-determination in this land, is interlinked and intertwined with achieving self-determination rights and equality for Palestinians.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Those born here can apply for passports if a parent was born in India between 1950 and 1987 -  but must surrender the certificate to do so. Many hesitate, as it's closely tied to their Tibetan identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July, as the Dalai Lama turned 90, thousands of Tibetan Buddhists gathered in Dharamshala - a quiet town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The town serves as the headquarters of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) - the Tibetan government-in-exile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even as they prayed for their leader's long life, many like Mr Tsundue found themselves reflecting on the uncertainty of living in exile. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The emotional weight of displacement, the legal limbo of statelessness and geopolitics around the Dalai Lama hung heavy on the birthday celebrations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Sandeep Yadav/BBC The Dalai Lama seen on stage with several people as devotees watch.

He now lives with his son and wife in a  neighbourhood largely inhabited by Tibetans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For many like Mr Sangbo, fleeing to India may have provided security - but they still yearn for their homeland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A home is a home, after all,\" says Pasang Gyalpo, who fled Tibet to Nepal before settling in India in 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five years later, Mr Gyalpo bribed Nepalese guards and slipped into Tibet to bring his family to India. But Chinese police chased him soon after arrival, forcing him to flee. His family remains in Tibet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They are in their homeland, I am in a foreign land. What else can I feel but pain?\" he asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For younger Tibetans like Mr Tsunde, who are born in India, the pain is more existential.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The trauma for us is not that we lost our land,\" he says. \"It's that we were not born in Tibet and don't have the right to live in Tibet. It is also this great sense of deprivation that something so very essential of our land, culture, and language has been taken away from us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lobsang Yangtso, a researcher on Tibet and Himalayan regions, explains that being stateless means lacking a sense of belonging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's painful,\" she says. \"I have lived all my life here [in India] but I still feel homeless.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d85/live/c81115b0-6ca2-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Activist Tenzin Tsundue joins Amnesty International USA, Reporters Without Borders and Committee of 100 for a peaceful protest in favor of freedom in Tibet in Times Square on March 9, 2012 in New York City.

I'm talking about refined data. Coarse quality data, is available. But that data is not of very high quality, it needs filtering,\" says Professor Bhattacharyya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The issue in India is for many Indian languages, especially tribal

bGFWdi\">contributed to Bhashini</a>, a government project to develop those high quality datasets needed to train an AI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As well as the datasets, Bhashini has built AI language models and translation services in 22 languages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Started in 2022, it's a huge undertaking, but has already made a lot of progress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bhashini currently hosts 350 AI-based language models that have processed more than a billion tasks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 50 government departments work with Bhashini, as well as 25 state governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example Bhashini tech is used in multi-lingual chatbots for public services and to translate

India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The AI \"will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,\" says Professor Jadhav.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will be very customized, it will not be something just off the shelf,\" he says.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back on the streets of the city, Vineet Sawant has increased the number of parcels he delivers from ten to around 30 a day, helped in part by the translation function in the delivery app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He thinks it will help more people like him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It makes us feel like we belong.

It has led to a growing number of such providers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The development comes amid China's sluggish economy and jobs market. Chinese youth unemployment remains stubbornly high, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">at more than 14%.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With real jobs increasingly hard to come by, some young adults would rather pay to go into an office than be just stuck at home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shui Zhou, 30, had a food business venture that failed in 2024. In April of this year, he started to pay 30 yuan ($4.20; £3.10) per day to go into a mock-up office run by a business called Pretend To Work Company, in the city of Dongguan, 114 km (71 miles) north of Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There he joins five \"colleagues\" who are doing the same thing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I feel very happy,\" says Mr Zhou. \"It's like we're working together as a group.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such operations are now appearing in major cities across China, including Shenzhen, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Kunming. More often they look like fully-functional offices, and are equipped with computers, internet access, meeting rooms, and tea rooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And rather than attendees just sitting around, they can use the computers to search for jobs, or to try to launch their own start-up businesses.

He says he felt that the office environment would improve his self-discipline. He has now been there for more than three months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou sent photos of the office to his parents, and he says they feel much more at ease about his lack of employment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While attendees can arrive and leave whenever they want, Mr Zhou usually gets to the office between 8am and 9am. Sometimes he doesn't leave until 11pm, only departing after the manager of the business has left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that the other people there are now like friends. He says that when someone is busy, such as job hunting, they work hard, but when they have free time they chat, joke about, and play games. And they often have dinner together after work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou says that he likes this team building, and that he is much happier than before he joined.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Shanghai, Xiaowen Tang rented a workstation at a pretend work company in Shanghai for a month earlier this year. The 23-year-old graduated from university last year and hasn't found a full-time job yet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her university has an unwritten rule that students must sign an employment contract or provide proof of internship within one year of graduation; otherwise, they won't receive a diploma.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She sent the office scene to the school as proof of her internship. In reality, she paid the daily fee, and sat in the office writing online novels to earn some pocket money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you're going to fake it, just fake it to the end,\" says Ms Tang.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Biao Xiang, director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany, says that China's pretending to work trend comes from a \"sense of frustration and powerlessness\" regarding a lack of job opportunities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Pretending to work is a shell that young people find for themselves, creating a slight distance from mainstream society and giving themselves a little space.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The owner of the Pretend To Work Company in the city of Dongguan is 30-year-old Feiyu (a pseudonym). \"What I'm selling isn't a workstation, but the dignity of not being a useless person,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He himself has been unemployed in the past, after a previous retail business that he owned had to close during the Covid pandemic. \"I was very depressed and a bit self-destructive,\" he recalls. \"You wanted to turn the tide, but you were powerless.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In April of this year he started to advertise Pretend To Work, and within a month all the workstations were full. Would-be new joiners have to apply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feiyu say that 40% of customers are recent university graduates who come to take photos to prove their internship experience to their former tutors. While a small number of them come to help deal with pressure from their parents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The other 60% are freelancers, many of whom are digital nomads, including those working for big ecommerce firms, and cyberspace writers. The average age is around 30, with the youngest being 25.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Feiyu, the owner of Pretend to Work Company says he is selling people \"dignity\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Officially, these workers are referred to as \"flexible employment professionals\", a grouping that also includes ride-hailing and trucker drivers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the longer term Feiyu says it is questionable whether the business will remain profitable. Instead he likes to view it more as a social experiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It uses lies to maintain respectability, but it allows some people to find the truth,\" he says. \"If we only help users prolong their acting skills we are complicit in a gentle deception.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Only by helping them transform their fake workplace into a real starting point can this social experiment truly live up to its promise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou is now spending most of his time improving his AI skills. He says he's noticed that some companies are specifying proficiency in AI tools when recruiting. So he thinks gaining such AI skills \"will make it easier\" for him to find a full-time job.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 gMiqnK iuHqSH\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 jdmgui\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

Dad said, 'I'm going to do everything I can so that you can live a normal life.'\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Days later, Dima's father had joined the military and left for the front line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fifteen-year-old Dima is sharing memories of his dad with 49 other Ukrainian children. Sitting around a campfire, they hold candles to commemorate their missing loved ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The gentle slopes of Ukraine's Carpathian mountains, smothered in brilliant green spruce and fir trees, stretch into the distance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a striking backdrop for this heartbreaking scene. We're in the relative safety of western Ukraine, Russian bombs rarely fall here.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Dima is one of the young people attending a summer camp for Ukrainian children whose loved ones have disappeared </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A little girl talks about when the full-scale invasion began. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The first time we got bombed, my hands were shaking and I was crying,\" she says. \"It took me a long time to cope with that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This campfire activity is a kind of group therapy session. It's part of a pioneering summer camp for a very special group of Ukrainian children, those with a parent who has disappeared during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some are soldiers missing in action on the front line, presumed dead. Some are in captivity or trapped in occupied areas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Ukrainian government says more than 70,000 people are officially listed as missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The charity that runs the camp, Gen.Ukrainian, helps thousands of traumatised children across Ukraine and runs several summer camps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is the first for this category of children, and the BBC was given exclusive access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Many of these children have multiple traumas because not only are their fathers missing, but some of them have uncles and grandmothers missing too,\" explains Vanui Martirosyan, lead psychologist at the charity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're living like in a frozen state. They cannot plan something in the future because they do not know what the future will bring. And we cannot work with them like with children with actual loss, because they do not have this point of starting grieving.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She says many of the children spend hours trawling Russian social media channels, desperately searching for information about their family members. The channels often contain violent content related to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They feel fear of crying, they think that if they start crying it will continue for forever. This type of trauma is maybe the most difficult to work with.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The day after the campfire meeting, I speak to Dima, who wants to tell me more about his dad. The last time he heard from him was the day before he disappeared in November 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He sent a video of them all drinking tea in the forest and wrote me a message saying, 'Everything's fine, I'll call you tomorrow,'\" Dima says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The next day, Dima's mum got a phone call saying his dad was missing in action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I started calling his mobile. Dad didn't answer. That was it. I was sitting there and I started crying. I realised I wouldn't see my dad for a while.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">For many of the children the camp is an opportunity to escape the constant threat of missile strikes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During all our interviews with the children, including with Dima, a Gen.Ukrainian psychologist was present.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I kept hoping until the end that Dad is a prisoner of war somewhere. Even now I still hope,\" Dima says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dima's trauma only intensified after his mum began to look into the circumstances of his dad's disappearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Initially she was told by the military that her husband was missing following an airstrike on his position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Then someone else called mum, the chief of something-or-other, and said the Russians shot everyone, and someone saw Dad's body lying there without any legs. Then another soldier who was at Dad's position said they saw him dead, with shrapnel wounds to the head.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dima says the effect on both him and his mother was profound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mum cried a lot because of that. I supported her,\" Dima says. \"When Dad left, he said, 'Dima, no matter what happens you must look after Mum because you're a man, and you're her son.\"'</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Group therapy at the camp takes place daily, held in small rooms. We are allowed to observe the start of one of the sessions - the rest is confidential.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One psychologists, Olena, shows a colour chart to the children, used to describe emotions. Green is happy, blue is sad, yellow is anxious or overstimulated, and red is anger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, they'll be discussing sadness. The more unpleasant and sad we feel, says Olena, the more we love the people we are sad about. That shows these people are important to us.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Camp psychologists say physical exercise such as hiking heals trauma, triggering hormones and reducing stress</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The children are encouraged to express their feelings, including through art. At an art therapy session, many of the paintings show happy families, houses and pets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One seven-year-old boy, Zahar, tells me his painting is called \"Daddy comes home.\" It shows yellow stick men in front of a blue sky - the colours of the Ukrainian flag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the children live in cities that come under near-constant bombardment by Russian drones and missiles. Like 16-year-old Nastia's hometown of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine, close to the frontline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If there's bombing nearby, I go and shelter in the corridor. I worry and stress a lot,\" Nastia says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her father was also a soldier. He disappeared around a year ago on the frontline. She last saw him two weeks before he went missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I ask her what memories of your father she has and her eyes glisten.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He was very kind, he spoilt me a lot. He had a sweet tooth like me, and always knew what treats to buy me,\" Nastia says. \"I remember only the good things about Dad. The only sad thing I remember is that he disappeared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I love him very much and I know he loves me too,\" she continues, adding, \"I hope we can make new memories with him again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This camp also offers the kids a chance to catch up on sleep, uninterrupted by air-raid sirens - and to just have fun and play. There are regular trips to the swimming pool, hikes and games of volleyball.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's important for the body to make movements in order to heal the trauma,\" explains head psychologist Vanui.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The therapy helps traumatised children understand that they are not alone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the camp closing ceremony, it's time for the children and staff to say goodbye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One boy, Ilya, is in floods of tears - he doesn't want to go home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have a child like this in every camp,\" smiles Oksana Lebedieva, the founder of Gen.Ukrainian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She points to the throngs of children playing in the garden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Maybe for the first time in their lives, they've found people who went through the same experience. And it's very important. Group therapy is more important than anything - to see you're not alone with the pain.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oksana says the scale of the task facing her charity is overwhelming. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Millions of Ukrainian children are traumatised by war. This is a humanitarian catastrophe.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-john-murphy\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by John Murphy</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

President Emmanuel Macron – who once as a student himself bought newspapers from Mr Akbar – is to decorate him next month with the Order of Merit, one of France's highest honours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When I began here in 1973 there were 35 or 40 of us hawkers in Paris,\" he says. \"Now I am alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It became too discouraging.

Many credit the interim government with stabilising the country's economy and, contrary to fears, the banking sector has survived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bangladesh has met its loan obligations, kept food prices largely stable, and maintained robust foreign exchange reserves - currently at $30bn (£22bn) - thanks to remittances and international loans. Exports have also held steady.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there are other, less easily measurable things.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Islam argues that, since the fall of Hasina, \"a democratic environment has been established, and now everyone can express their views freely\". That is something to be celebrated in a country shaped by a history of political turbulence, military coups, assassinations, and bitter rivalries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that is being questioned by some.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The influence of student leaders over the interim government has drawn criticism. They were given the roles in recognition for their leadership in the unprecedented protests which toppled Hasina.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, two remain in the cabinet, and critics say some controversial decisions, such as the temporary ban on the Awami League, were made under student pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The government has at times complied with some of the populist demands, particularly by the students, fearing more threatening protests could otherwise erupt. However, that was the exception rather than the rule,\" Mr Bergman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, an exiled leader from the Awami League alleges that the party's supporters are being silenced by not being allowed to contest the next poll - with most of its leaders in exile or in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The elections will not be inclusive without the participation of the Awami League,\" Mohammad Ali Arafat, former minister in Hasina's cabinet, tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its latest report, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/authoritarian-system-yet-be-taken-apart-39\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) said there had been an alarming rise in mob violence</a> while extra-judicial killings and deaths in custody had persisted in the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have overthrown an authoritarian regime, but unless we put an end to the authoritarian practices, we cannot really create a new Bangladesh,\" Iftekhar Zaman, the executive director of the TIB, said during the launch of the report earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Bangladesh stands at a crossroads, the next six months will be critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some argue that, if there are no meaningful changes to the chequered political system, the sacrifices of those killed in the uprising could be rendered meaningless. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Symbols like the Celtic harp and the Shamrock are seen by many as belonging to both traditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a complex and evolving set of choices, with frequent arguments. Promotion of the Irish language is bitterly opposed by a vocal section of Unionism. For most Catholics their Irish identity was historically something to be defended in a Unionist dominated state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was an identity that helped bind them to their co-religionists on the rest of the island, particularly in the fields of Gaelic sport and culture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But as politics has changed there is less preoccupation with religious background, a greater sense of belonging to an international culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And this is without even beginning to speak of an identity that is demonstrably northern Irish with its shared dry humour.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Everyone has their own menu of what being \"culturally Irish\" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It can also mean a sense of a particular landscape, either one you loved, or were glad to escape - or for second or third - generation Irish, a landscape of brief immersion on summer holidays from England. That was the world of \"the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting\" evoked by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are as many definitions of \"culturally Irish\" as there are Irish people, or people who want to be Irish.

I am Irish. Living in Britain. I was born here while my father was a real-life cultural import, acting in the West End in J.M. Synge's landmark drama, The Playboy of the Western World, a story from the west of Ireland, which won rave reviews from London audiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We went home after the play ended and I was brought up in Ireland. But I returned to work for the BBC. I have spent more than three decades as a correspondent for the BBC, and I have lived outside Ireland for longer than I did in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What does that make me?

But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: \"And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. Identity is also a story of deep and loving relationships, whether in Ireland, London, the African continent or France, to name but three important ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My feelings about identity are also inextricably linked to my experiences as a war reporter. I spent too many years witnessing ethnic cleansing, genocide and crimes against humanity often carried out because of hatred of a different identity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The great writer, James Joyce, rejected any identity built around \"nationality, language, religion\" and defiantly vowed to \"fly by those nets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was writing about a different, much narrower Ireland of the early 20th century. But the policing of identity – who you are allowed to be - is disturbingly present in many societies, and many guises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, if somebody asks me to narrow my identity to a single label, I refuse, because it is mine, not to be explained or justified.

Now, they fuel her fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Between 2018 and 2024, those panels were installed at Rubí and Clemesí, two massive solar plants in Peru's Moquegua region, about 1,000 kilometres south of the capital, Lima. Together, they form the country's largest solar complex – and one of the biggest in Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From her home in the small settlement of Pampa Clemesí, Rosa can see the rows of panels glowing under white floodlights. The Rubí plant is just 600 metres away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet her home – and the rest of her village – remains in total darkness, unconnected to the grid the plant feeds into.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The Rubí solar plant can be seen from various spots throughout the town</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Power from the sun, but not at home</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">None of Pampa Clemesí's 150 residents have access to the national power grid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few have solar panels donated by Rubí's operator, Orygen, but most can't afford the batteries and converters needed to make them work. At night, they use torches – or simply live in the dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The paradox is striking: the Rubí solar power plant produces around 440 GWh a year, enough to supply electricity to 351,000 homes. Moquegua, where the plant is located, is an ideal site for solar energy, receiving over 3,200 hours of sunshine annually, more than most countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that contradiction becomes even sharper in a country currently experiencing a renewable energy boom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2024 alone, electricity generation from renewables grew by 96%. Solar and wind power depend heavily on copper due to its high conductivity – and Peru is the world's second-largest producer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Peru, the system was designed around profitability. No effort was made to connect sparsely populated areas,\" explains Carlos Gordillo, an energy expert at the University of Santa María in Arequipa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Orygen says it has fulfilled its responsibilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've joined the government project to bring electricity to Pampa Clemesí and have already built a dedicated line for them. We also completed the first phase of the electrification project, with 53 power towers ready to operate,\" Marco Fragale, Orygen's executive director in Peru, told BBC News Mundo, the BBC's Spanish-language service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fragale adds that nearly 4,000 metres of underground cable were installed to provide a power line for the village. The $800,000 investment is complete, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the lights still haven't come on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The final step – connecting the new line to individual homes – is the government's responsibility. According to the plan, the Ministry of Mines and Energy must lay about two kilometres of wiring. Work was slated to begin in March 2025, but hasn't started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">BBC News Mundo tried to contact the Ministry of Mines and Energy but received no response.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Residents gather for dinner in darkness, illuminated only by a solar-powered torch</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A daily struggle for basics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rosa's tiny house has no sockets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each day, she walks around the village, hoping someone can spare a bit of electricity to charge her phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's essential,\" she says, explaining she needs the device to stay in touch with her family near the border with Bolivia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the few people who can help is Rubén Pongo. In his larger home – with patios and several rooms – a group of speckled hens fight for rooftop space between the solar panels.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Rubén works at the Rubí plant and lives in Pampa Clemesí</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The company donated solar panels to most villagers,\" he says. \"But I had to buy the battery, the converter, and the cables myself – and pay for installation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rubén owns something others only dream of: a fridge. But it only runs for up to 10 hours a day, and on cloudy days, not at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He helped build the Rubí plant and later worked in maintenance, cleaning the panels.

Among them is Pedro Chará, now 70. He's watched the 500,000-panel Rubí plant rise almost on his doorstep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Much of the village is built from discarded materials from the plant. Pedro says even their beds come from scrap wood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There's no water system, no sewage, no rubbish collection. The village once had 500 residents, but due to scarce infrastructure, the majority left – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sometimes, after waiting so long, fighting for water and electricity, you just feel like dying. That's it.

Tonight, she's cooking dinner for a small group of neighbours who share meals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the kitchen, a gas stove heats a kettle. Their only light is a solar-powered torch. Dinner is sweet tea and fried dough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We eat only what we can keep at room temperature,\" says Rosa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Without refrigeration, protein-rich foods are hard to store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fresh produce requires a 40-minute bus ride to Moquegua – if they can afford it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But we don't have money to take the bus every day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With no electricity, many in Latin America cook with firewood or kerosene, risking respiratory illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Pampa Clemesí's residents don't cook at night due to lack of lighting, and using candles or wood-burning stoves can be dangerous</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Pampa Clemesí, residents use gas when they can afford it — wood when they can't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They pray by torchlight for food, shelter, and water, then eat in silence. It's 7pm, their final activity. No phones. No TV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our only light is these little torches,\" Rosa says. \"They don't show much, but at least we can see the bed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If we had electricity, people would come back,\" Pedro says. \"We stayed because we had no choice. But with light, we could build a future.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A soft breeze stirs the desert streets, lifting sand. A layer of dust settles on the lampposts on the main plaza, waiting to be installed. The wind signals that dusk is coming – and that soon, there will be no light.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For those without solar panels, like Rosa and Pedro, the darkness stretches on until sunrise. So does their hope that the government will one day act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Like so many nights before, they prepare for another evening without light.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But why do they still live here?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Because of the sun,\" Rosa replies without hesitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Here, we always have the sun.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But as the economy has waned post-Pandemic - and with multiple trade wars on the horizon - the market may be drying up.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the whiskey, which is traditionally made with corn and aged in charred oak barrels, has roots going all the way back to the 18th Century, it wasn't until 1964 that it became an iconic piece of Americana, when Congress passed a law declaring it a \"distinctive product of the United States\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But drinking trends come and go, and by the end of the 20th Century, bourbon was considered a bit old fashioned - pun intended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You often see these kind of generational shifts where people don't want to drink what their parents drink,\" said Marten Lodewijks, the US president of IWSR, which collects alcoholic beverage data and provides industry analysis. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then, as the world recovered from the 2008 recession, drinkers seemed to rediscover this classic spirit, for a few different reasons. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For starters, the price point was good, which made it attractive for bar managers to purchase and incorporate into cocktails and for younger drinkers to sample. Then, in 2013, a law was passed in Kentucky that made it easier for companies to purchase and resell vintage bottles, opening up a high-end collectible market. Add to that the rise in mid-century nostalgia fuelled by shows like Mad Men, and bourbon was due for a full-blown Renaissance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sales of bourbon grew by 7% worldwide between 2011-2020, which is more than three times the growth of the decade prior, according to industry data company IWSR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soon, some bourbon distillers were becoming quasi-celebrities, and people were starting to buy up bourbon bottles not to drink, but as an investment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Everyone was going crazy over the bourbon market, and treating like a commodity, like a stock,\" recalls Robin Wynne, a general manager and beverage director for Little Sister in Toronto, Canada, who has been a bar manager for about 25 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People would go in as a prospector, to flip bottles for two to three times the value.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But like most market bubbles, this one was bound to burst. The pandemic's lockdowns tanked bar sales, and inflation has made many would-be bourbon drinkers choose less expensive options - or forgo drinking all together. Amongst Gen-Z, many 20-somethings <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220920-why-gen-zers-are-growing-up-sober-curious\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">are drinking less</a> than their older siblings and parents did at their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those factors have contributed to declining alcohol sales, with bourbon sales specifically slowing down to just 2% between 2021-2024, according to IWSR data. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Donald Trump's global tariffs have been the final straw. The EU has announced retaliatory tariffs against US goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Californian wine, although implementation has been delayed for six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, most provinces in Canada have stopped importing American alcoholic beverages in retaliation. The country accounts for about 10% of Kentucky's $9bn (£6.7bn) whiskey and bourbon business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves ... that's a very disproportionate response,\" Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has said that tariffs will boost made-in-American businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Republican Senator Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, said the tariffs will hurt local businesses and consumers in his home state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it's always passed through as a cost. So, there will be higher prices,\" he told ABC's \"This Week\" in May.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A long wooden hall is flanked by stacks of wooden bourbon barrels on either side, with industrial lights illuminating the way\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">There are 86 distilleries in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association, and over 10 million barrels of bourbon aging </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These economic pressures have created a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Liquor giant Diageo, reported that sales of Bulleit, a Kentucky distillery that makes bourbon, rye and whiskey, where down 7.3% this fiscal year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wild Turkey - a Kentucky bourbon owned by Campari - sales were down 8.1% over the past six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While big, international brands will likely be able to weather the storm, the sales hit has led to a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July, LMD Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - just one month after opening the Luca Mariano Distillery in Danville, Kentucky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This spring, Garrard County Distilling went into receivership.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And in January, Jack Daniel's parent company closed a barrel-making plant in Kentucky.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The bottom of the barrel has not yet been reached, warned Mr Lodewijks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'd be extraordinarily surprised if there weren't more bankruptcies and more consolidation,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In part, bourbon has become a victim of its own success - the rise in bourbon sales, and the growth of the premium market, helped fuel many small distilleries. Because bourbon must age in barrels for years, what's on the market today was predicted a few years ago, which means that there is currently an oversupply, which is driving down prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while these economic conditions are harsh, Mr Lodewijks said that history has shown how tough times can create innovation. Scotch whisky used to be fairly simple, a blend of middle-of-the road tipples. But when sales declined in the second part of the 20th century, distillers started aging their excess bottles, which helped create the market we have now for premium, aged Scotch whisky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Canada, where bourbon imports have slowed to a trickle, local distilleries have started experimenting with bourbon-making methods to give Canadian whiskey a similar taste.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The tariff war has really done a positive for the Canadian spirits business,\" noted Mr Wynne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've got lots of grains to make these whiskeys without having to rely on the States.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But years of migration to cities have shrunk families and turned places like Seoul into sprawling metropolises. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unaffordable housing, rising costs and gruelling working hours have led more and more young people to reject marriage or parenthood, or both.

The choice of name - \"convenience stores\" - was a deliberate attempt to distance them from psychiatric clinics, important in a country where there is still a stigma against asking for help for mental health - especially among older residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, some of their reservations can still be seen when they walk through the door for the first time, compounded by their experience of isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Visitors are often uncomfortable speaking to another person or eating together initially, store manager Lee says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The typical loneliness, if that repeats for days, months, and half year, that is now more than a feeling,\" Lee explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Those folks start to avoid places with people. So many people ask us if they can take the ramen to go because they won't eat with others.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lee would tell them that they don't need to talk.

Added worries over pace ace Jasprit Bumrah's fitness further dimmed India's prospects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Losing the first Test at Headingley from a winning position, as England chased 373 in the fourth innings, confirmed pundits' doubts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But India recovered from this setback in style to win the next Test at Edgbaston by a whopping 336 runs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The swift turnaround came not from luck but skill and relentless determination - qualities that defined India's performance for the rest of the series.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The three Tests that followed were bitterly fought, both teams raising the intensity and skill levels, matching each other blow-for-blow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This sparked frequent heated clashes but also unforgettable acts of heroism, with players from both sides battling fatigue and injury to keep their teams in the fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some aspects of what kept India in the fight right through the neck-and-neck contest comes through in the stats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three batters - Gill, Rahul and Jadeja - topped 500 runs in the series. England had one, Joe Root. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were 12 centuries made by India, England had nine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammed Siraj with 23 was the highest wicket-taker from either side. The only bowler to take 10 wickets in a match was Akash Deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Failures were scant, heroes were plenty, but the pillars of India's extraordinary show in the series were Gill and Siraj.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gill, in Bradmanesque form, made 754 runs, 430 of them coming in one Test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He failed by a mere 20 runs to break Sunil Gavaskar's record series aggregate, and was also second to Don Bradman (810) for highest runs made in a series by a captain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To be mentioned alongside Bradman and Gavaskar testifies to Gill's achievement and potential. His prolific scoring earned his team's full respect, and after a hesitant start, he quickly grew in confidence, showing fine temperament and smart tactics in tough situations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images India's Akash Deep (L) and India's Yashasvi Jaiswal 2L) celebrate winning the final Test cricket match between England and India at The Oval in London on August 4, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The future looks rosy for the young Indian team</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj, who since his 2021 debut had lived in the shadows of Bumrah and Shami, emerged so spectacularly that he instantly entered cricket folklore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feisty and indefatigable, he bowled with a lion's heart - steaming in at full tilt, sparing his body no mercy, embracing the spearhead's role in Bumrah's absence, and inspiring the other pacers to bowl out of their skins - earning universal awe and admiration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj's 23 wickets came at an average of 32.43, with an economy rate of 4.02 and a strike rate of 48.43 - hardly earth-shattering figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In India's two victories, he was the decisive force. At Edgbaston, his six wickets in the first innings (seven overall) swung the match firmly in India's favour. At the Oval, he took nine wickets - four in the first innings and five in the second - turning the match on its head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">How India held their nerve for 25 days under immense pressure - driven by willpower, ambition, and skill - culminating in a thrilling final 56-minute comeback at the Oval to win and level the series, is one of Test cricket's most riveting tales.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also marked this Indian young team's transition from apprehension and misgivings one of rich promise fuelled by ambition and excellence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The future looks rosy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And when asked the following day whether he was giving Israel a \"green light\", he instead spoke about the US strikes on Iran earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Washington's Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was even more direct - and his answer was that Netanyahu's Gaza plan is not America's concern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" he said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has faced some opposition to his plan - notably from the Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had argued against a full-scale occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the event, an announcement after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet did not say Israel would take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, but rather that it would \"prepare for taking control of Gaza City\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It did, however, mention that one of five principles for ending the war was \"Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some have suggested a full takeover of Gaza has always been on the table. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Netanyahu had always planned to take over Gaza, he just was waiting for the right moment,\" Amin Saikal, emeritus professor of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has suggested Israel does not want to keep the territory, however, but \"hand it over to Arab forces\" - without specifying which. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the plan, however, the Trump administration is not giving Netanyahu any public indication that he is wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That represents a marked change in White House policy. Trump previously had been more than willing to outline his views on Gaza's future - even when it caught Netanyahu and the Israelis by surprise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Americans also expressed their unhappiness with Israeli attacks on Syria last month - publicly disapproving, while offering even sharper criticism in private.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bibi acted like a madman,\" a White House official told the news website Axios. \"He bombs everything all the time.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As recently as a month ago, the White House was optimistic that a deal was within reach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire,\" Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a \"lasting peace in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But just over two weeks later, ceasefire talks had collapsed, and Witkoff was publicly accusing Hamas of being selfish and not acting in good faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hamas didn't really want to make a deal,\" Trump said on 25 July. \"I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, that will become apparent soon enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Trump administration has got a lot of leverage, \" said Prof Saikal of the Australian National University. \"I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on,\" Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. These moves were designed to bring additional pressure on Israel to wind down its military operations and reach a negotiated settlement with Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both represent a tacit acknowledgement that the current situation is untenable, and that a negotiated peace is further away than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, there is no telling how long this trend will last.

Paul Biya</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 92, Paul Biya is the world's oldest serving head of state. He has been in power for nearly 43 years since 1982. Biya leads the ruling CPDM party which dominates the political scene. He is widely considered the favourite, now that his main rival, Kamto, is out of the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The veteran politician has never lost an election since the return of multi-party politics in 1990. However, his victories have been marred by allegations of vote rigging – claims which his party and the government have continuously denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing his intention to run, Biya said his eighth mandate would focus on the wellbeing of women and young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"2.-bello-bouba-maigari\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">2. Bello Bouba Maigari</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bello Bouba Maigari, 78, is an experienced politician who hails from Cameroon's vote-rich northern region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the president of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) party founded in 1990. He served in the governments of both of Cameroon's presidents -Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In fact, he was Biya's first prime minister between 1982 and 1983. Since 1997, Maigari has forged an alliance with Biya's CPDM party that helped the latter clinch significant votes from the north. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, this political marriage ended in June following pressure from within his party to run independently. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While serving as Minister of State for Tourism and Leisure, Maigari announced his resignation and declared himself a candidate against Biya, who he also faced in the 1992 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"3.-issa-tchiroma-bakary\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">3. Issa Tchiroma Bakary</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another former Biya ally whose candidacy came as a surprise is 75-year-old Issa Tchiroma Bakary. Like Maigari, he is from the country's north and has been influential in helping Biya secure the region's votes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After a 20-year stint in different government roles, Tchiroma finally pulled the plug on his time with the 92-year-old leader, resigning from his role as Minister of Employment and Vocational Training to announce his candidacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tchiroma, who heads the Cameroon National Salvation Front (CNSF) party, criticised Biya's governance style and hinged his presidential bid on a promise to overhaul the system, which he described as \"suffocating\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A man painted in green and white colours \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Supporters of Joshua Osih came out in donned in party colours when he campaigned in the 2018 election, but he came fourth</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"4.-cabral-libii\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">4.

Akere Muna</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Akere Muna was a candidate in the 2018 presidential election but pulled out at the last minute and threw his weight behind Kamto. This time around, Muna, a staunch international anti-corruption lawyer, says he wants to challenge Biya himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 72-year-old is from a family of politicians - his late father Solomon Tandeng Muna served as Prime Minister of West Cameroon after independence, Vice-President of the then Federal Republic of Cameroon and Speaker of the National Assembly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Speaker, Solomon Muna swore in Biya when he took over as president after Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Muna is promising to rid the bilingual country of the corruption and bad governance that he says have soiled its image at the international scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"6.-joshua-osih\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">6.

The SDF used to be the country's main opposition outfit, but its influence later dwindled, exacerbated by infighting and the expulsion of several party members in 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Osih, 56, came fourth in the 2018 polls with 3%, but is hoping to defeat Biya through a promise of social and institutional reforms.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A close-up shot of Maurice Kamto.

Since becoming a member of parliament in the process, he has challenged the government on key policy issues, promising sweeping changes if he takes over the reins of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Dr Hugues says Libii's vision is opaque, citing Akere Muna as a more convincing candidate with a much clearer project for the nation of nearly 30 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Muna has a wealth of international experience and diplomatic character, and that is what the nation needs now,\" he said, while praising the renowned lawyer's five-year transition plan to \"put the nation back on track\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Could the opposition unite?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Historically, Cameroon's opposition has been fragmented especially during elections, with analysts saying this has disadvantaged them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of this year's presidential election, there has been much talk about the need for the opposition to unite and harmonise strategies to take on Biya.

Fru Ndi even claimed victory, but the authorities rejected allegations of vote rigging and confirmed Biya as the winner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many believe if the opposition doesn't band together as it did in 1992, Biya might have an easy ride to the presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has the experience, the human resources and the system to his advantage,\" says Dr Hugues.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">More about Cameroon from the BBC:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
