A crackdown on illegal immigration was central to his successful re-election campaign and is backed by many around the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety efffort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in an interview with the Wall Street Journal</a>, Trump praised the agents' work but suggested the operation would eventually end, although he did not specify when.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At some point we will leave,\" Trump said. \"They've done a phenomenal job.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state's Governor Tim Walz has urged the president to remove the agents immediately. \"We believe that Trump needs to pull his 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another American in the street,\" he said on Sunday. Other state and local officials have echoed Walz's view.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.

One sign, drawn with red paint and directed at federal agents, read \"stop killing us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lifelong Minneapolis resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those gathered on Sunday afternoon to protest against ICE and pay her respects to Pretti.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm tired of protesting,\" she said. \"We can't comprehend how this is happening.

Many there expressed anger and sadness about the immigration operation. Protesters repeatedly chanted: \"No more Minnesota nice, Minneapolis will strike.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those chanting was Felix Johnson, who said he protested for the first time in his life a few weeks ago when he saw a video which appeared to show a four-year-old girl who was left in a car after her father was detained by ICE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He held a sign that read \"ICE out\", while dozens of other posters in the crowd included profanities directed at immigration officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't understand how they can come in and just start snatching people that are citizens and start treating them like they're animals,\" Johnson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/politics/poll-ice-immigration.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">several polls suggest</a> about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">One conducted by Politico</a> shortly after Renee Good's death this month suggested about half of Americans felt the mass deportation campaign was too aggressive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the protest in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday, one man held a sign that read \"Veterans Against ICE\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I joined [the military] to serve a country that, while never perfect, was a country that was improving, that was growing,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I joined to support the tenets of freedom of this country and what we're seeing here, this is the opposite, this is not promoting freedom.

Ties have sharply deteriorated after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Tokyo would get involved militarily if China attacked Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The twins' departure will leave Japan without any pandas for the first time since 1972, the year the two countries normalised diplomatic ties.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240226-a-brief-history-of-panda-diplomacy---with-new-additions-to-global-zoos\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a gesture of goodwill</a> towards its international allies and competitors since it was founded in 1949.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China retains ownership of all pandas it loans to foreign countries, including cubs born abroad. In return, host countries pay an annual fee of about $1m (£790,000) per pair of pandas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Tokyo's metropolitan government, some 108,000 people vied to get one of the 4,400 slots available for one last look at the zoo's beloved pandas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have been bringing my son here since he was a baby, so I hope it becomes a good memory for him.

On Saturday he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qww3w72lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada</a> if it strikes a trade deal with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gold and other precious metals are seen as so-called safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of uncertainty. On Friday, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, building on its almost 150% rise last year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demand for precious metals has also been driven by a range of other factors including higher-than-usual inflation, the weak US dollar, buying by central banks around the world and as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Washington seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have also helped push up the price of gold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tonnes of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's enough to fill between three to four Olympic-sized swimming pools.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Geological Survey estimates that another 64,000 tonnes of gold can still be mined from underground reserves, although the supply of the metal is predicted to plateau in the coming years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,\" said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a really good diversifier

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gold saw a blockbuster year in 2025, with its biggest annual gain since 1979 as investors flocked to precious metals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are overpriced, gold repeatedly hit new record highs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Susannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club, an investment platform for the wealthy, said gold \"seems to know no bounds\" amid ongoing political uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The pile on into the gilded safe haven is continuing with the precious metal racing up higher,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Streeter pointed to trade tension sparked by Trump's tariff threat against Canada, saying it had \"unnerved investors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While economic concerns can help push up the price of gold, it also tends to rise when investors expect interest rates to be cut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lower rates typically mean smaller returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to assets like gold and silver.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its main interest rate twice this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's inversely correlated because the opportunity cost of keeping the money in a [government bond] is really not worth it anymore, so people go

Kavalis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The start of this year has seen gold continue to rally but Frappell warns the \"news-driven\" market could also result in a fall in its price.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's got to be scope for unexpected news that actually might be positive for the world and not necessarily positive for gold,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But not everybody is buying gold for purely investment reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many cultures, the metal is purchased during festivals or given as gifts at celebrations such as weddings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In India, the annual Diwali festival is believed to be an auspicious occasion to buy precious metals in order to bring on wealth and luck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the US investment bank Morgan Stanley, Indian households held $3.8tn of gold, equivalent to 88.8% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neighbouring China is the world's largest single consumer market for gold, with many believing that buying it brings good fortune.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We often see a seasonal uptick in demand around Chinese New Year, which we are seeing at the moment to an extent,\" said Kavalis, referencing the upcoming Year of the Horse, which begins in February.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He felt he had two options: \"Go to the police and say, 'I'm in the Interpol system,'\" and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean \"you can't rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked\", which is what happened to him, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's constant nerves, all the time,\" he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country.  The police can \"break into your house at any time… that's why you're like a cornered rat\", he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you,\" that breaks families apart, he adds.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says it wasn't just that he was against \"having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to\" but that \"it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency's checks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol's internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), arguing that Russia's request was politically motivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol's constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used \"to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images A firefighter is standing on a ladder next to a light grey multi-storey building which has white smoke pouring out of it.

He showed us CCF documents that said the information Russia had provided was \"generic and formulaic\" and there had been an \"inadequate explanation\" of the alleged crime. Interpol cancelled the request for Pestrikov's detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol only releases very basic data about illegitimate requests for arrests and since 2018 has not revealed which countries are the subject of complaints and inquiries. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the scale of the problem, but for the first time, the leaked documents reveal a much fuller picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One batch of files shared with the BBC contains a list of complaints sent to the CCF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The data is not complete, but it covers a broad range of countries, and where the nation requesting an arrest is listed, there are more complaints about Russia than anywhere else - this has been the case for the past 11 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files also show that in the past decade, at least 700 people who were wanted by Russia complained to the CCF, and at least 400 of them had their red notices or diffusions overturned - that is more than for any other country, according to the data we received.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The files show Russia attempted to use Interpol's messaging system to get information about journalist Armen Aramyan after he left the country</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Historically it has been Russia who is one of the main perpetrators of abusive red notices,\" says British barrister Ben Keith, who has represented many clients wishing to have their names removed from Interpol's wanted lists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He thinks Interpol has a particular problem with Russia and that the agency's attempts to prevent abuse have not been successful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says that he has \"a steady flow of clients who are subject to Russian red notices who are either politically connected, or often pro-Ukraine, or alternatively as a result of corporate raiding\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International lawyer Yuriy Nemets, who specialises in Interpol matters and extradition, agrees that Interpol's extra scrutiny of Russia's requests for arrests, introduced after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has not proved effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is aware of a number of cases in which Russians opposed to the war \"have been targeted for speaking out against what's going on and were charged with financial… or other ordinary crimes and put into the database based on that\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not hard to game the system,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as information on notices and complaints, the Interpol insider also provided the BBC with thousands of messages sent between individual countries via Interpol's messaging system, revealing another, less formal route to trace people abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One message from Moscow to law enforcement agents in Abu Dhabi explained how Interpol had denied a request for a red notice, but that it still wanted help in tracing the subject's whereabouts.

The exchange relating to Karakulov happened after Interpol announced its additional vetting of Moscow.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5adf/live/ea789370-f853-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool via REUTERS Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova sit on opposite sides of a desk.

And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even while concerns about Russia's misuse of Interpol's systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This seems to have been settled in Moscow's favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its \"strict rules on the processing of data\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was \"concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol's systems\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Russia's ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. \"If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time,\" says Keith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, \"with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting: Andreea Jitaru and Ned Davies</b></i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The government has not yet responded to the call for a review of the policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boutcher has directly asked whether NCND's continued application on Stakeknife amounts to it being used as a tool for covering up things that should never have happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I question whether this decision protects agents, or rather does it actually protect the government and intelligence agencies from accountability for historical wrongdoing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Paul Thompson case he argued that he, as chief constable, rather than the government, had the right to allow the coroner to release a summary of police files. The high court and court of appeal backed his position before it was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the hearings, government barrister Sir James Eadie KC said Boutcher was being \"thoroughly disingenuous\" and that \"politics is being played with national security\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argued the government is best placed to make assessments on national security, as only it has access to the full range of necessary advice. The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trust, state secrecy and the public</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife.

This fact was uncovered by the journalist John Ware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is an issue because it is Lord Sales' ruling in the Thompson case which has a central bearing over whether Scappaticci can be named and more details revealed about what went on, including Lord Sales' own role.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked the Supreme Court whether, given Lord Sales' role in the Scappaticci matter, if it was appropriate for him to have heard the Thompson case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, the court said: \"Great care is taken in the selection of the panels which will hear a case at the UK Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A Justice will not deal with a case where it is considered there is a conflict of interest and individual Justices are careful to ensure that they have none.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The cases of Seamus Dillon and Sean Brown</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two further cases that touch on the potential release of information about the role of the state during the Troubles are also before the Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Troubles-related inquests were shut down in 2024 with the passing of the Legacy Act, which created a new body called the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to examine relevant cases, including those being investigated by police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The families of four men who were either killed or injured during the Troubles won a further legal victory, when the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal ruled the government has too much veto power over the disclosure of material by the ICRIR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lady Chief Justice Siobhan Keegan said that the provision in the Act giving the Northern Ireland secretary \"the final say\" on disclosure of sensitive national security information by the ICRIR would risk undermining public confidence in the body.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK government's appeal will be ruled on by the Supreme Court in the coming months.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the moments before the shooting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him. One agent can be seen striking at his head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another officer, who appears to approach the scuffle with empty hands, pulls back with what appears to be a gun in his hand. As he moves away toward a vehicle, a split second later another agent standing beside him opens fire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agents jump back from the man lying on the ground and the firing continues. A total of 10 gunshots are heard. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What do we know about the gun?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7169/live/6fc33bf0-f96e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Homeland Security A 9mm semi-automatic handgun placed on a car seat with a charging cable beside the gun.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Homeland Security</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they say belonged the man who was shot </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the shooting, DHS shared a photo of a firearm on social media, which they said belonged to Pretti. The agency also said he had two magazines of ammunition and no ID. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino told reporters it looked like a \"situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\". He did not provide any further evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference that Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry. His only previous interactions with law enforcement, as far as police are aware, were related to parking tickets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a sign of the tensions between federal and local authorities, the police chief also said the DHS had not provided his team with \"any specific details\" about the deadly incident itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was asked to clarify if Pretti had brandished a gun. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said: \"Individuals showed up to impede a law enforcement operation and assaulted our officers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They responded according to their training, and took action to defend the officer's life and those of the public around him. And, I don't know of any peaceful protester that shows up with a gun and ammunition rather than a sign.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, said he understood the risk of people trying to bear witness and document the actions of federal agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Thank God, thank God, we have video because, according to DHS, these seven heroic guys took an onslaught of a battalion against them or something.

This year, it will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has invited them as chief guests for the celebrations, placing the European Union at the centre of one of the country's most prestigious state events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this day, India turns the heart of its capital into a stage. Thousands of troops march before cheering crowds, armoured vehicles move down the Kartavya Path (formerly Rajpath or King's Avenue) and colourful tableaux or floats pass by spectators in Delhi, while millions more watch on their screens across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The parade is presided over by the Indian president, with the chief guest seated alongside - closer to the presidential chair than even the senior-most government officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Who sits next to India's president has long been read as more than a matter of protocol. Over the decades, the choice of chief guest has come to be closely watched as an indicator of India's foreign policy priorities and the relationships Delhi wants to highlight at a particular moment, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The practice began in 1950 with the then Indonesian president, Sukarno, attending India's first Republic Day parade.

The chief guests have been from leaders of neighbouring countries - such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka - to heads of state and government from major powers, including the US and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has featured as the chief guest five times - including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - reflecting the long and complex history between the two countries. Leaders from France and Russia (formerly Soviet Union) have also been invited nearly five times since 1950, reflecting India's long-standing strategic ties with the two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With such a wide range of past guests, the question is how India decides who receives an invitation in a particular year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The selection process is largely out of public view. Former diplomats and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/how-india-republic-day-chief-guest-chosen-9079203/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">media reports</a> say it typically begins within the foreign ministry, which prepares a shortlist of potential invitees. The final decision is taken by the prime minister's office, followed by official communication with the select countries - a process that can take several months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity said: \"Strategic objectives, regional balance and whether a country has been invited before are all taken into account.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Indian ambassador to the US Navtej Sarna said a lot of thought goes into the decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a balance between important partners, neighbours and major powers,\" he said, adding that availability of the state leader during that time also plays a crucial role.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f2ea/live/b79c13b0-f81b-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images Former president of United States of America (USA) Barack Obama along with his wife Michelle Obama, President of India Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi during the ceremony of 66th Republic Day of India, at Rajpath, on January 26, 2015 in New Delhi, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Barack Obama became the first American president to attend the parade in 2015</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign policy analyst Harsh V Pant said the evolving list of chief guests mirrors India's changing engagement with the world. \"If you think of the EU delegation this year, with its leadership coming, it's very clear that we are doubling down on our engagement with the EU.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that most likely a trade deal would be announced - signalling that India and the European bloc are on the same page when it comes to the current geopolitical situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes as <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gr6e6dn5lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">India continues to engage with the US on a trade deal</a>. The talks, which have been going on for almost a year, have strained their relationship since the US imposed 50% tariffs on Indian goods, the highest in Asia, including penalties linked to India's purchase of Russian oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It [the choice of the parade's chief guest] gives you a sense of India's priorities at that particular point - which geography it wants to focus on, or whether there is a milestone it wants to mark,\" Pant said, pointing out that India continued to engage closely with the global south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2018, for example, leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) were invited as chief guests. It was the first time a regional grouping was invited - marking 25 years of India's engagement with the bloc, Pant added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, some absences from the guest list have also reflected strained relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistani leaders attended twice as chief guests before the neighbours went to war in 1965. Islamabad has not been invited thereafter - a sign of continuing strain in ties. The only time China attended was when Marshal Ye Jianying came in 1958, four years before the two countries went to war over their disputed border. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the significance of Republic Day extends beyond diplomacy and guest lists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Indian President Abdul Kalam (R), Russian President Vladimir Putin (2R) and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (L) watch Indian army jets flying over India's 58th Republic Day parade from a bullet-proof box, in New Delhi, 26 January 2007. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the Republic Day parade in 2007</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts says India's parade stands apart from similar military displays elsewhere in the world for a number of reasons. The fact that India has a guest almost every year is one of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, for most countries, these parades commemorate military victories. Like <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61332283\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Russia's Victory Day</a> marks the defeat of Germany in World War Two, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-36808199\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">France's Bastille Day</a> celebrates the start of the French Revolution and the eventual fall of the monarchy, and China's military parade marks their victory over Japan in World War Two. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's celebration, by contrast, is centred on the constitution, says Pant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many other countries, these celebrations are related to victories in war. We don't celebrate that. We celebrate becoming a constitutional democracy - the coming into effect of the constitution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike military parades in many Western capitals, India's Republic Day also blends displays of its military capability with cultural performances and regional tableaux, projecting both power and diversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beyond strategy and symbolism, the parade often leaves a more personal impression on visiting leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former official who spoke anonymously recalled how the Obamas were particularly struck by the camel-mounted contingents - a moment that stayed with them long after the formal ceremonies ended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Following the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyr6p30054o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest Russian bombardment </a>overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither?

Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services.

They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
