However, the coalition said the plane left three hours late without Zubaidi, who \"fled to an unknown location\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The legitimate government and the coalition received intelligence indicating that Zubaidi had moved a large force - including armoured vehicles, combat vehicles, heavy and light weapons, and ammunition - from the Jabal Hadid and al-Solban camps [in Aden] towards al-Dhale,\" coalition spokesman Maj-Gen Turki al-Malki said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coalition forces, in co-ordination with legitimate government forces and the [Saudi-backed] National Shield Forces, launched limited pre-emptive strikes to disrupt these forces and thwart Zubaidi's attempts to escalate the conflict and extend it into al-Dhale,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 15 strikes hit al-Dahle early on Wednesday and at least four civilians were killed, two hospital sources told AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maliki also accused Zubaidi of distributing weapons to \"dozens of elements\" in Aden \"with the aim of creating unrest\", and said the coalition had asked STC deputy leader Abdul Rahman al-Mahrami, who is also a member of the presidential council, to impose security there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the presidential council issued a decree saying Zubaidi had been stripped of his membership and referred to the attorney general for prosecution on charges including \"high treason\", \"damaging the republic's military, political and economic standing\", and \"forming an armed gang and committing the murder of officers and soldiers of the armed forces\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been established that [Zubaidi] has abused the just cause of the South and exploited it to commit grave crimes against civilians in the southern governorates,\" it alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC's foreign affairs authority said in a statement that it had sent a delegation led by its secretary-general, Sheikh Abdul Rahman al-Subaihi, to Riyadh because it was committed to \"engaging positively and responsibly with various political initiatives and dialogue efforts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the same time, President Aidarous Qassem al-Zubaidi continues to carry out his duties from the capital, Aden, alongside his people, closely following up on and directly supervising the work of the military, security, and civilian institutions,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said it had been \"taken by surprise\" by the coalition air strikes in al-Dahle, describing them as an \"unfortunate escalation that is inconsistent with the declared climate of dialogue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also expressed concern that no official information had been received about the whereabouts and circumstances of Subaihi's delegation in Riyadh, which it said \"raises serious questions that require urgent clarification\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Maduro has been brought to the US to face drug-trafficking and weapons charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday the US president told NBC News: \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration this week, the BBC's US partner CBS reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place, and even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued in recent days that American oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country has an estimated 303 billion barrels - the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan oil is also heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently operating in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" Turenne added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ConocoPhillips, a major US oil company that no longer has a presence in Venezuela, \"is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability\", said spokesman Dennis Nuss.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments,\" Nuss said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A third company, Exxon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that the US's \"blatant military action against Venezuela, and its demand that Venezuela prioritise the US in disposing of its oil resources, is a typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and a grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I want to emphasise that the legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected... cooperation between China and Venezuela is the cooperation between two sovereign states, which is under protection of international law and the domestic laws of the two countries.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vice-President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reality is more complex. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976 and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for this 2007 move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" American oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ownership of natural resources by sovereign nations is considered a key tenet of international law.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Real progress still needs Russian support, and Moscow has been notably silent in recent days about diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin is known to oppose the prospect of a European-led international force in any disputed areas and will be reluctant to halt his troops', albeit slow, advance if Moscow's war objectives have not been realised. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But pressure is undoubtedly growing on both sides to make compromises and end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddg7100ym2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Zelensky said a peace deal was \"90% ready\"</a>. Agreeing on the remaining 10% would \"determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Territory and security guarantees have been at the forefront of unresolved issues for negotiators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgexgwr1wrro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Ukraine's eastern Donbas or Russia will seize it,</a> rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has so far ruled out ceding any territory, but has suggested that Ukraine could withdraw its troops to an agreed point - but only if Russia does the same.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions form the industrial region of Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The original US-led 28-point peace plan widely leaked to the media last year was seen by Kyiv and its European allies as being heavily skewed in Russia's favour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This triggered weeks of intensive high-level diplomacy - with Ukraine, the US and European leaders trying to amend the draft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Kyiv sent the US an updated 20-point plan - as well as separate documents outlining potential security guarantees and provisions for Ukraine's reconstruction, Zelensky said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

tech-filled versions of its small building blocks - which it says will bring sets to life with sound, light and reaction to movement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the new product range has got a mixed reaction from play experts, who say it risks undermining what makes Lego distinct for children in an increasingly digital world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas, the Danish toymaker's Smart Play system introduces new electronic components to the classic plastic blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lego says its new tech-enabled products, launching in March with a new Star Wars set, are its \"most revolutionary innovation\" in nearly 50 years.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Josh Golin, executive director of children's wellbeing group Fairplay, believes Smart Bricks could<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>\"undermine what was once great about Legos\" - harnessing children's own imagination during play.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the toy did not require extra features to generate sounds or other effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As anyone who has ever watched a child play with old-school Legos knows, children's Lego creations already do move and make noises through the power of children's imaginations,\" he told the BBC. \"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Andrew Manches, professor of children and technology at the University of Edinburgh, agreed the beauty of Lego lay in \"the freedom to create, re-create, and adapt simple blocks into endless stories powered by children's imagination\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he also welcomed Lego's efforts to integrate physical and digital play with tools that react to the way children interact with its Smart Play products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Julia Goldin, the company's chief product and marketing officer, previously told the BBC it viewed digital technology as an opportunity to \"expand physical play and physical building\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't look at the digital world as a threat,\" she said - adding its smart range weaves interactivity \"seamlessly\" with its physical products.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Lego Smart Bricks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lego says its Smart Bricks can sense motion, position and distance, allowing the models to respond in various ways during play.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Measuring 2x4, the brick itself contains sensors, lights, a small sound synthesiser, an accelerometer and a custom-made silicon chip enabling it to detect movement and react to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is designed to be used with Smart Minifigures and Smart Tags tiles - two additional products making up Lego's Smart Play System.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similarly adapted from existing Lego components, these possess digital identifiers triggering different sounds or reactions when they detect and interact with each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For instance, when tried out by the BBC at CES, a Lego birthday cake recognised when its \"candles\" were blown out - sounding a cheer and a happy birthday song.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a Lego helicopter made whooshing sounds when moved or rotated, with its Smart Brick lighting up red upon crashing.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Using a wireless system developed by Lego, the three models communicate with each other to produce particular responses through the Smart Brick.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tom Donaldson, head of Lego's Creative Play Lab, said the tech intended to respond to children's actions and complement the way they naturally play.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the Smart Brick's reactions to responses would \"hopefully inspire and surprise the user to keep them continuing to play\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are building a platform that we want to last for many years,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Manches told the BBC reduced cost and size of components has \"enabled more toymakers to integrate digital technology seamlessly into a range of toys\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added despite exciting innovation, concerns remain about the security and privacy of new and emerging smart toys for children - particularly those which integrate AI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The key is to us all to remain critically reflective of the design of these toys, and to pay much attention to how they influence children's everyday lives,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not the first time Lego has dabbled in digital experimentation or sought to appeal to increasingly online audiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2017 it has released augmented reality apps and experiences letting people play with computer-generated models layered over their surroundings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Through collaborations with video game publishers such as Nintendo and Fortnite-maker Epic Games it has also looked to appeal to fans of trending games or new launches - releasing a Super Mario Minifigure in 2020 with a tiny display screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lego chief executive Niels B. Christiansen said in the firm’s 2024 annual report it had accelerated spending on digital technology as a \"strategic area\" for the company.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

There are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://understandingwar.org/research/middle-east/iran-update-january-5-2026/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reports of protests in a further 11 provinces</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The wave of protests has spread rapidly across Iran since 28 December, when anger initially broke out in the capital Tehran following a fresh and sharp devaluation of the country's currency against the dollar and other major foreign currencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Verified footage from the last 10 days shows evidence of anti-government demonstrations and gatherings in more than 50 towns and cities across the country, including in several regions previously perceived as being highly loyal to the state.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 100 videos which we geolocated and checked for publication date paint a picture of the scale of the unrest, with people taking to the streets in many major cities in Iran and presenting the largest challenge to the state since the Women, Life and Freedom protests in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage has also shown protests in Qom in central Iran and Mashhad in the north-east, both of which have traditionally hosted populations extremely loyal to the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Sina Azodi, Director of Middle East Studies Program at George Washington University, said that unrest in those cities was \"very telling\" and amounted to evidence that the government's \"base of support is also suffering under the economic hardship\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have traditionally used violence to crush unrest. During the 2022 protests - sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who had been detained in Tehran for wearing \"improper hijab\" - more than <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3kl56z2l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">550 people were allegedly killed by security forces</a>, according to human rights groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the latest response by police and security forces initially appeared to be more restrained, verified footage has shown officers ramping up the use of force since Saturday. This change in approach coincided with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's first public reaction to the protests on that day, in which <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2057md3gvro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he said that \"rioters must be put in their place\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the supreme leader's remarks, Iran's judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said authorities would \"listen to protesters and critics who legitimately and rightly have concerns about their livelihood and social and economic welfare\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added that they would \"deal firmly with those who seek to exploit the situation, incite riots, and undermine the security of the country and the people\". The powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) has also issued warnings to protesters in Lorestan province that they will no longer tolerate street gatherings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has so far confirmed the identities of at least 11 people reported dead since 28 December using a combination of verified funeral videos and interviews with family members and friends.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign-based human rights group HRANA says at least 35 people have so far been killed in the unrest, including two affiliated with security forces.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the most violent crackdowns happened in Malekshahi, a small town in the western province of Ilam, on Saturday. Verified footage showed a small demonstration taking place at Commandery Boulevard, where the officers of several state institutions are located, before gunfire appeared to break out. Human rights groups said four people were killed in the incident, with the semi-official Mehr and Tasnim news agencies putting the figure at three dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later footage showed a number of people being transported to hospital. It was unclear from the footage what condition those seen in the footage were in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple verified videos filmed in the nearby Ilam city show security forces firing shots towards Imam Khomeini Hospital in the centre of the city later on Saturday. Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security forces have also been firing on protestors in other cities. In Fasa in the south-western Fars province, forces wearing military and riot gear were seen firing towards demonstrators.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Police fire shots towards protesters in Fasa, Iran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts warned that the security forces heavy-handed response could exacerbate the challenges facing the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces -  who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders,\" Peyman Jafari, assistant professor of international relations at the US-based College of William and Mary, told BBC Verify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most of the footage featuring violence seen by the BBC was carried out by security forces, a few clips have also shown demonstrators attacking government forces. In Qom, one video showed officers riding motorbikes being pelted with rocks as they sped past a small gathering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another dramatic clip showed a security officer on a motorbike set ablaze by a demonstrator wielding an improvised flamethrower after security forces violently detained and beat up a protester. It is unclear what happened to the officer, as the footage cut off, while other officers gave chase to the demonstrator who fled on foot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the western city of Azna, demonstrators appeared to start a fire outside a police station after security forces opened fire on protesters earlier. BBC Persian has identified at least three demonstrators killed in Azna by verifying footage of funerals and speaking to family members.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Demonstrators appear to start a fire outside a police station in Azna, Iran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demonstrations initially began as a backlash against what they say is the government's mismanagement of the country's struggling economy, which has increasingly floundered under the weight of international sanctions. Officials have also been accused of widespread corruption. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in recent days the demonstrations have taken an anti-state tone, with protesters in numerous locations chanting slogans against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the clerical establishment that has been ruling the country since the 1979 Islamic revolution. Verified videos have also shown chants in support of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the Shah of Iran, and the pre-1979 revolution Pahlavi dynasty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the University of Tehran, some protesters chanted \"death to the dictator\" - a reference to Khamenei - as dozens of demonstrators flooded through the institution's main gate on 30 December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the city of Iranshahr in the coastal Sistan and Baluchestan province, protesters set fire to a statue of Khamenei and the leader of the 1979 revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Protestors set fire to pro-government statue in in Iranshahr, Iran</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Holly Dagres, senior fellow at the Washington Institute and curator of the Iranist newsletter, said the Tehran government had learned few lessons from the 2022 protests which raged across Iran for more than four months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While the catalysts differ… the problems remain the same: systemic mismanagement, corruption, and repression,\" she said. \"The countless anti-regime chants make clear that many Iranians are calling for the ouster of the Islamic Republic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the extent of the demonstrations, most of the experts who spoke to the BBC said they do not yet amount to an existential threat to the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Security forces are loyal - there are no defections at this point and law enforcement forces are carrying out the orders,\" Azodi said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Furthermore, while the protests are widespread we are not seeing a clear strategy [or] attempt by the protesters to bring down the Islamic Republic.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"reporting-by-shayan-sardarizadeh,-ghoncheh-habibiazad,-matt-murphy,-farzad-seifikaran,-emma-pengelly,-sherie-ryder,-yi-ma,-christine-jeavans,-jess-carr-and-paul-brown\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Reporting by Shayan Sardarizadeh, Ghoncheh Habibiazad, Matt Murphy, Farzad Seifikaran, Emma Pengelly, Sherie Ryder, Yi Ma, Christine Jeavans, Jess Carr and Paul Brown</i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Khmara, his replacement, was also involved in the preparation of that operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So it did not come as a surprise that Malyuk's dismissal earlier this week was widely criticised within Ukraine, including by several high-profile military commanders. The impression that the decision made by President Zelensky was short-sighted was cemented by reports that Malyuk had initially refused to step down voluntarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although he has been dismissed from the position of SBU chief, he has been asked  to continue leading special operations against Russia. Ukraine needed more \"asymmetric operations against Russian forces\", Zelensky said, adding that Malyuk was \"best at this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khmara's appointment has gone some way in quelling fears about the SBU's future effectiveness. But former SBU operative Ivan Stupak argues his reputation - though solid - is limited to a certain sphere and that it is unclear whether he will be able to translate his experience to running the wider SBU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stupak also believes that Malyuk's dismissal is connected with the appointment of former spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as Zelensky's new chief of staff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Malyuk and Budanov are at loggerheads,\" he told the BBC, implying that Budanov had heavily influenced Zelensky's decision and that Khmara would now be \"in the hands\" of Budanov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other analysts disagree. Oleksandr Notevskyi, political analyst for Ukrainian media outlet Grunt, praised Khmara's appointment, pointing out his successes in heading Alpha, one of the top elite divisions of the SBU: \"He's young, he's experienced, he is one of the authors of the Spider Web operation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, the SBU described Khmara as a decorated and \"experienced special-purpose officer\" who was involved in liberating the Kyiv region in 2022 and fighting the Russians in the occupied region of Donetsk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khmara's appointment will need to be confirmed by the Ukrainian parliament, which may yet reject it. Other options are on the table, Notevskyi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of war, Ukraine is struggling to push back Russian forces in the conventional way - on the battlefield and along the long front line in the east of the country. It has had more success targeting oil fields, weapons factories and - as in the case of the Spider Web attack - air bases and valuable aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At this particular juncture of the war with Moscow, Notevskyi argued, \"whoever leads the security service should be someone who is specialised in eliminating Russia's military capacities on the territory of Russia\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Zelensky announced significant changes to his top team. Mykhailo Fedorov was nominated as new defence minister, while foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko replaced Budanov. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of Zelensky's reshuffles have been criticised by commentators as damaging to the country at a time of crisis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Using a football analogy, Stupak argued that Zelensky was like a manager going to the substitute bench for replacements. \"But his bench is quite short, and he's running out of people to use again and again,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-volodymyr-lozhko-and-anastasiia-levchenko\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Volodymyr Lozhko and Anastasiia Levchenko</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The venues should have been checked annually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We regret that - we owe it to the families and we will accept the responsibility,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that sparklers - which are believed to have caused the fire when they were raised too close to the ceiling - will be banned in local venues. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local authorities will now bring in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud conceded there was a team of five people inspecting more than 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana and could not explain why the bar had not been inspected since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taking repeated questions on why the bar had not been checked in so long, Feraud said: \"I have no answer for you today.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're profoundly sorry about that and I know how hard that will be for the families.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not resigning, no, and I don't want to,\" he later added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said it would be \"down to the judges\" to decide whether members of the local authority would be included in a criminal investigation that has been opened by Swiss prosecutors.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b674/live/6c6303b0-eaf9-11f0-bcea-2116275a6f01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters A woman kneels on the floor lighting a candle next to a pile of tributes including flowers and other lit candles outside Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People in the area have been leaving tributes to the victims of the deadly New Year's Day fire</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the fire occurred on New Year's Day, the bar seemed to have many more people in it than legally permitted, which Feraud said was the responsibility of the managers of Le Constellation to regulate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said the maximum capacity was 200 people, with emergency exits designed to cater for 100 people on each side of its two levels. However he did not know if the exit on the basement level was working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss prosecutors have placed the two bar managers <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjdjl303zxlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under criminal investigation</a>, which local media have named as French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are both suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence, the prosecutors' office in Valais said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors have said they believe the fire started when people celebrating the New Year raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached, setting light to sound-insulating foam on the ceiling of the basement bar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said the use of sound-proofing material on the ceiling of the bar and allowing sparklers in the venue was extremely negligent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss national broadcaster RTS has shown footage from 2019 of partygoers holding bottles with sparklers. An employee warns them to be careful of the \"mousse\" - the French word for the acoustics foam panelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Questioned on the video, Feraud said it was likely no-one in the council saw the images and he wished it had been brought to his attention at the time as he would have investigated. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feraud said while inspections of the facility were conducted in 2016, 2018 and 2019, there were none from 2020 to 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the press conference in 2015 the owners renovated the bar and it did not require a permit, which was when the sound insulation foam was stuck on the ceiling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There were never any checks on this soundproofing foam. Our security agents did not consider it necessary,\" Feraud said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators will be assessing several elements, including the nature of the foam, compliance with standards for access and emergency exits in the basement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Accounts from reported scenes include that people pushed and shoved, notably on the staircase leading to the basement. Under Swiss regulations, doors are required to open in the direction of the exit and be clearly signposted. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Switzerland's political system, power is distributed among three levels of the confederation, 26 cantons and then about 2,131 municipalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While safety regulations are set by cantons, they need to be implemented by local authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Crans-Montana's failure to adhere to fire safety regulations by not inspecting Le  Constellation from 2020 to 2025 may point to a potential fault with the system. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And its state media showed off the footage from that meeting to prove it: smiling men in suits, reviewing some of the 600 current agreements between their two countries - except the next photograph of Maduro was taken on board a US warship, blindfolded and handcuffed, in grey sweats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China joined many countries around the world in condemning Washington's stunning move against a sovereign state. It accused the US of acting like a \"world judge\" and insisted that \"the sovereignty and security of all countries should be fully protected under international law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those stern words aside, Beijing will be making careful calculations not just to insure its foothold in South America, but also to manage an already tricky relationship with Trump and plot its next steps as the great power competition between the US and China takes a new, wholly unexpected turn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many see this as an opportunity for China's authoritarian Communist Party rulers. But there is also risk, uncertainty and frustration as Beijing tries to figure out what to do after Trump tore up the very international rulebook it has spent decades trying to play by.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing, which likes to play the long game, is no fan of chaos. That is certainly what it seems to be coming up repeatedly against in Trump's second term. It had planned ahead and weathered the on-again, off-again trade war.

This is where we live – and we're not going to allow the western hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors and rivals of the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The not-so-hidden message was for Beijing: get out of our backyard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing is unlikely to listen. But it will wait to see what happens next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Beijing strongly condemned a US report that suggested Washington will order the acting Venezuelan president to sever economic ties with China and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters that this was a \"typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty and will do grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/881c/live/fc6e9100-eada-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Nicolás Maduro is seen in handcuffs after landing at a Manhattan helipad, escorted by heavily armed Federal agents as they make their way into an armored car en route to a Federal courthouse in Manhattan on January 5, 2026 in New York City. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nicolás Maduro escorted by US federal agents after landing in New York city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some wonder if China is waiting and watching to see if it could do the same in Taiwan, the self-governing island which it views as a breakaway province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi has vowed that Taiwan will one day be \"reunified\" with the mainland and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this. And some nationalists on Chinese social media are asking: if the US can unilaterally act in Caracas, what is stopping Beijing from snatching the Taiwanese president?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For one, Beijing might not see those parallels because it considers Taiwan an internal matter, and not a concern of the international order. But more important, if Xi decides to invade the island, it will not be because the US has set a precedent, according to David Sacks from the Council on Foreign Relations. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/trumps-strikes-venezuela-will-not-embolden-china-invade-taiwan\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">He writes that China doesn't have the \"confidence that it can succeed at an acceptable cost\".</a> </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Until that day comes, though, China will continue with its strategy of employing coercion to wear down Taiwan's people, with the aim of forcing Taiwan to the negotiating table. The US strikes on Venezuela do not change this dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rather, they are a challenge China did not need and does not want - and they risk its long-term plan to win over the Global South.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The relationship between Beijing and Caracas was fairly simple. China needed oil. Venezuela needed cash. From around 2000 to 2023 Beijing provided more than $100bn to Venezuela to finance railways, power plants and other infrastructure projects. In exchange, Caracas gave Beijing the oil it needed to fuel its booming economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 80% of Venezuelan oil was sent to China last year. That's still only 4% of the country's oil imports. So, when it comes to China's financial risks in Caracas, \"it's important to keep some perspective\", says Eric Olander, editor-in-chief of The China-Global South Project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chinese firms like CNPC and Sinopec are among the largest players there and there is a risk of those assets either being nationalised by the Venezuelans, under the direction of the US or otherwise marginalised amid the chaos.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also around $10bn of outstanding loans that Venezuela owes Chinese creditors, but again, Olander urges caution as it's unclear if any investments in the country are currently at risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it could warn off future investors. \"Chinese enterprises need to fully assess the risks and extent of potential US intervention before investing in related projects,\" Cui Shoujun, from the School of International Relations at Renmin University, said on Chinese state media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing will not want to jeopardise the fragile trade truce it just signed with the US, but it won't want to lose its foothold in Latin America either. Striking that balance is going to be hard, especially with someone as unpredictable as Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The concern for China is that other countries across South America start to worry about significant Chinese investments \"out of concern of attracting unwanted US attention\", Olander says. \"This region is a critical source of food, energy and natural resources to China with two-way trade now topping half a trillion dollars.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also made it clear it wants the Panamanian government to cancel all Chinese port holdings and investments related to the Panama Canal, which, he adds, is  \"undeniably concerning for China\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So Beijing may have to win the battle in Washington's backyard in other ways.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/409d/live/36d1ec70-eadb-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) and Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro Moros (L) walk side by side in black suits during a welcoming ceremony outside the Great Hall of People on September 22, 2013 in Beijing, China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Xi and Maduro in Beijing in 2013</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has shown patience and persistence in wooing South America. The Global South is a group of countries that have signed up to  \"a community with a shared future\" and urge opposition to \"unilateral bullying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This message resonates with governments that have grown wary of the West and, in particular, Washington under Trump. China is usually explicit from the start about what it wants from its partners - they recognise the \"One China\" principle and Taiwan is treated as an \"integral part\" of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing has had considerable success in persuading Latin American states to switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, with Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras all siding with the $19tn economy's talk of strategic partnership over the last 20 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast, Trump has shown that a relationship with Washington can be volatile. And that could play into China's hands, as it seeks to project Xi as a stable leader, now more than ever before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important because the situation in Venezuela could easily descend into chaos,\" Olander says. \"Also, don't forget the lesson from Iraq, where the US also said the country's oil reserves would pay for the reconstruction of the economy. That did not happen and China is now the largest buyer of Iraqi crude. Something similar could easily happen in Venezuela.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the US was urged by China hawks in Congress to counter Beijing's influence across South America. It has made its move but what no-one seems sure of is what comes next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything about this is a gamble – and Beijing, by all accounts, hates to gamble.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That's what the southern state of Karnataka is betting on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, legislators passed a bill which aims to prevent hate speech and hate crimes that fuel communal tension or target individuals and groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hate speech is not new in India, but it has intensified in recent years as social media has spread and television channels amplify comments and reactions. A report last year found hate speech against minorities - mainly Muslims - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx9942x72o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">rose 74%</a> in 2024, peaking during the national elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's why the Karnataka government - led by the Congress party - says the move is necessary, arguing that hate speech can lead to real-life violence. But critics warn this could come at the cost of civil liberties and free speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Karnataka Hate Speech and Hate Crimes (Prevention) Bill, 2025, which still needs the state governor's sign to become law, sets out how hate speech cases should be investigated and prosecuted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It defines hate speech as any \"expression which is made, published, or circulated… in public view\" verbally, in print, television or social media. But it also defines a hate crime as the \"communication of hate speech\", without specifying whether it needs to lead to violence or not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill gives the state government the power to order social media and digital platforms to take down content it deems hate speech, something only the federal government can do currently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India doesn't have a federal law against hate speech but a number of provisions across laws prohibit certain forms of speech, writing and actions as exceptions to free speech. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This includes criminalisation of acts that could promote \"enmity between different groups on grounds of religion\" and \"deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57d3/live/ead5efd0-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"DIPR, Karnataka G Parameshwara in the Karnataka legislative assembly defending the hate speech and hate crime bill\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">DIPR, Karnataka</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara says the new bill closes loopholes in existing laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BJP, which governs nationally but is in the opposition in Karnataka, has said that bringing in a separate law is unnecessary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Karnataka home minister G Parameshwara told the assembly the bill would close loopholes in existing law, making hate speech and hate crimes non-bailable and giving the state wider powers to act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also raises punishments. If passed into law, those convicted of hate crimes would face non-bailable jail terms of one to seven years and fines of 50,000 rupees ($550; £410), with tougher penalties for repeat offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief minister of neighbouring Telangana state, also governed by the Congress, has said that they will introduce a similar bill as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BJP, often accused of coming down sharply on dissent nationally and in states it governs, has been protesting against the bill, saying it could curb free speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Through this law, the state government is taking away people's right to free speech guaranteed by the constitution, and putting opposition leaders and the media behind bars,\" opposition leader R Ashoka told the assembly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Legal experts and free speech activists echo the concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supreme Court lawyer Sanjay Hegde warns that the law could be misused by political parties across the spectrum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One party's hate speech is another man's political propaganda and vice versa. Just because you dislike some speech, it does not become hate speech,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alok Prasanna Kumar, advocate and co-founder of Vidhi Centre for Legal policy, says that while the intent behind the law might be good, there is \"enormous scope for misuse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate has also raised a more fundamental issue around how hate speech and crime are defined by law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is an attempt by a state to define hate speech as a term in the law, which expands beyond existing provisions on promoting enmity and outraging religious feelings, to include speech targeting caste, religion and other identities,\" said Siddharth Narrain, assistant professor at National Law School of India University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he says the bill blurs the line between hate speech and hate crime. Hate speech, he argues, should be prosecuted because it can lead to violence, but the current wording treats communication itself as a hate crime even when no violence follows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts also cite a 2015 Supreme Court ruling that laws criminalising speech must be precise, not vague or overly broad, to avoid a \"chilling effect\" in which people self-censor for fear of prosecution.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/692b/live/c2601e40-ead8-11f0-97ff-1df4f0d33d7f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man looks at his mobile phone in Manajipet village in the district of Gadwal, Telangana, India, on Monday, June 11, 2018. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The problem of hate speech has worsened in recent years with social media becoming ubiquitous</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BJP leaders and some activists have urged the governor not to pass the bill but to instead send it to the Indian president for consideration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Advocate and social activist Girish Bhardwaj, who has written to the governor, says the bill regulates citizens rather than hate speech. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues it gives excessive discretion to \"executive agencies\" - senior police and administrative officers - to decide what speech falls under the law, raising the risk of conflicts of interest, especially when the government is being criticised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a senior Karnataka government official told the BBC, on condition of anonymity, that the bill would empower police by removing the need for government permission to file chargesheets, ruling out abuse of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The police will have to approach the court directly and face consequences for inaction or mistakes,\" the official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This also means the accused can be tried regardless of political affiliation, the official added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If a party worker indulges in hate speech or a hate crime, the ruling party may not sanction prosecution. Under this law, the government cannot intervene,\" the official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics, however, argue that because the first point of action is the police, they may exercise a wider discretion in deciding what qualifies as hate speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The first step is the police; the judiciary comes much later,\" Kumar says, arguing that the law's breadth and harsh penalties could push police to act on political signals rather than independent judgement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is why I am not so sure this bill will achieve any of its intended effects at the end of the day,\" he adds.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

complex\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting followed the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi urged Lee to \"firmly stand on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices\", China's official Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also brought up the two countries' shared history of resisting Japan militarism, saying that China and South Korea should now \"work hand in hand to safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War Two and uphold peace and stability in Northeast Asia\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his four-day trip to China, Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while South Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on \"viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue \"constructive\" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another item high on Lee's agenda is<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson similarly told reporters on Tuesday that both sides have agreed to \"carry out orderly, healthy, and beneficial cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Asked whether the US would carry out an operation targeting Colombia, Trump replied, \"It sounds good to me\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Historically, Colombia has been a close ally in Washington's war on drugs, receiving hundreds of millions of dollars annually in military assistance to counter cartels.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iran</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran is currently facing <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3kl56z2l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mass anti-government protests</a>, and Trump warned overnight that the authorities there would be \"hit very hard\" if more protesters died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're watching it very closely.

But there has been no trial - court records show a series of postponements, for reasons ranging from missing reports and incomplete investigations to unavailable judges and administrative delays.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jason, who works as a call centre manager, says the impact has been both emotional and financial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm the provider now, not only for my wife and baby, but also for my younger sister and grandmother because my mother used to help them out as well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is desperate for the case to conclude.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No healing can be done without putting something to rest.

We urge the public to not lose faith and hope in the justice system,\" Mohalaba tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But organisations such as Action Society, which support victims through the legal process, say the justice system is failing people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The system is broken at every step, and sometimes the delays force people to give up.
