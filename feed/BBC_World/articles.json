The BBC has reached out to the White House, Carney's office and Canada's minister responsible for US-Canada trade for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Saturday post, Trump referred to the prime minister as \"Governor Carney\" and  wrote that if \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not provide a timeline or more information about the threatened tariff. Last year, when he first threatened new tariffs on the US northern neighbour, Trump began calling Canada the US's \"51st state\" with Carney as its \"governor\", and suggested he may try to acquire the country entirely. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the countries' relationship had been improving in recent months, Trump's push to take control of Greenland and his comments about Nato have put him at odds with Canadian and European leaders. Carney did not mention the president by name in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week, but he warned of a \"rupture\" in US-led world order, which seemed to anger Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said in his own address, which followed Carney's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7jjp8gl0jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump then on Friday </a>withdrew Canada's invitation to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, which is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, he blasted Canada in a social media post for being \"against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland\", referring to the anti-missile shield he has planned, and for \"doing business with China\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In discussing the deal with China, where Canada would ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and China would lower levies on Canadian agricultural products,  earlier this month, Carney told reporters that  \"the world has changed\" and progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Canada's relationship with China has become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts told the BBC Canada's policy on China has undergone a significant shift, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he returned to office last year, Trump put new tariffs on goods from Canada, including a 35% tax on all items that don't fall under a free trade agreement between the two countries that is currently under mandatory review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney pushed back on Trump son Thursday saying that Canada and the US \"have built a remarkable partnership\" over many decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But Canada doesn't live because of the United States,\" he said. \"Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have never really asked anything of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That triggered a huge backlash from the families of soldiers who served in Afghanistan, as well as veterans and politicians from across the Westminster and international spectrum who called for Trump to apologise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prince Harry said the sacrifices of troops needed to be respected as he pointed out Nato's collective security clause had been invoked once - following the 9/11 attacks.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks the previous month. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 3,500 coalition soldiers died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which suffered 2,461 fatalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Downing Street said the prime minister and US president spoke about the UK's involvement alongside US and Nato forces in the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson said: \"The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home. We must never forget their sacrifice\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly after the conversation, Trump posted fresh comments on his Truth Social platform - appearing to step back from his critical comments but stopping short of directly apologising for the words he used in Thursday's interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wrote: \"The great and very brave soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a bond too strong to ever be broken.

Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year, the US announced a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87l7xjp235o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">vast arms sale to Taiwan</a> worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdred61epg4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro</a>, carried out strikes against <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged drug boats</a> in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86vvjxe9z7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">acquire Greenland</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"not coming back\"</a> and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed \"to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people,\" she told reporters. \"It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a serious situation we are in. Everyone can see that. Now there is a diplomatic, political track that we will pursue,\" she said. Her trip was a \"working\" visit to prepare their \"next steps,\" she said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Trump<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6388085020112\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> told Fox News</a> that the US \"gets everything we want at no cost\" and that a \"piece\" of his planned \"Golden Dome\" missile defence system would be placed on Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked if this was an actual \"acquisition\", he answered: \"It's total access. There's no end, there's no time limit.\" Notably, Trump did not mention American ownership of Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For former Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, that's a sign of positivity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hear a change in the language from the President,\" he told the BBC \"He does not necessarily think he has to own [Greenland].\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a bit more optimistic than I have been for quite a long time, where we saw only escalation after escalation after escalation,\" says Lidegaard, who's also known for inspiring <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61591675\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the latest series of Borgen</a>, a Danish political drama, which features a plotline about a power struggle over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite Trump's climbdown, Greenlandic MP Aaja Chemnitz told the BBC it will take much more to rebuild trust among her compatriots. \"I think it's too early to lower our shoulder… Many people are confused and concerned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier Trump had also told CNBC that an \"ultimate long-term deal\" over Greenland \"pertains to security and minerals, and everything else\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chemnitz is sceptical. \"Minerals haven't been discussed with Nato. Why should they do that? This is completely up to Greenland,\" she said, which has legal authority over its own land and resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Likewise, Per Stig Moeller, another former Danish Foreign Minister, remains cautious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the situation is \"still very delicate\" and \"might change tomorrow\", pointing to recent meetings in Washington, and the White House's diverging interpretation of what had been agreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why it's very important that we insist, it all happens inside NATO,\" he suggests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land</a> where the US would build military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any sovereignty, making clear that it is a \"red line\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Frederiksen has said it was non-negotiable, although Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued that taking control over Greenland is necessary for the security of the United States, pointing to a growing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response Denmark and its European allies have sought to reassure the US that they'll boost Arctic security, while calling for a more substantive Nato presence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Danish PM Mette Frederiksen, in the centre of the picture wearing a light-brown puffer jacket, walks with the Greenland prime minister and a large crowd towards the camera on an ice-covered street in Nuuk with houses and a church in the background.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Frederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They withdrew bases. They withdrew soldiers,\" says Per Stig Moeller. \"Did we throw them out? No, we did not. They went themselves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was updated in 2004, jointly with the Bush administration, to include Greenland as an equal partner to the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We signed it together,\" says Moeller, who was Denmark's foreign secretary at the time. \"It's the real working treaty today.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[The US] can make important changes to their military, to bases in Greenland. They just have to inform us or confer with us,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AFP has reported that sources familiar with talks had said the US and Denmark would renegotiate the 1951 agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Danish national newspaper Berlingske also writes that a renegotiation is possible, that the Danish and Greenlandic sides have not ruled out revising that deal. However, mineral rights or the surrender of territory have never been on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has reached out to Denmark's Ministry of Defence, which declined to comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whatever is negotiated, Aaja Chemnitz says it could be an uphill battle for the United States to win Greenlandic hearts and minds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When Trump's talking about a 'big chunk of ice' that he wants,\" she says, referring to the US president's speech in Davos, \"this is very, very disrespectful towards the people of Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it will be much more difficult for the US to make an agreement,\" she adds. \"The people of Greenland are really pushing away from the US, after everything that has happened this last year.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said on Friday there had been no detailed plan, but that negotiations would start soon, focusing on \"security, security, and security\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trump-cabinet-member-weighs-in-on-alberta-separatism-9.7058082\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos</a> calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymd0d8zvyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">responded in his own speech with</a>: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Following the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyr6p30054o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest Russian bombardment </a>overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither?

Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services.

They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after Arctic security <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60837944\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was thrust into the headlines </a>following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that additional defences in the region are urgently needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such a threat is no longer theoretical. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyvmj6mem70o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is \"primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access\", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,\" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a \"business president\" who believed the island represented \"a more robust trading opportunity\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to \"shift the dial\" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,\" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, \"it's all still about potential\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"His logic is that there's a national security imperative,\" Spence said. \"My belief is that this is much more economically driven.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-natalie-sherman\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So discussions to reach a deal may centre on a renegotiation of that agreement, according to US officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hovering over negotiations is Trump's insistence to \"own\" Greenland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If he were to have his way, in addition to overcoming the red lines over sovereignty, negotiators would also need to find a solution to the constitutional ban on the sale of land in Greenland.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One model is offered by the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba, which has been under total US control since 1903 after a kind of permanent lease agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear whether these were some of the options that prompted Trump's U-turn at Davos to drop the threat of military action to annex Greenland to the relief of his Nato allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato was founded in 1949 on the principle that an external attack on one ally is an attack on all. Denmark had made it clear that a military attack by an ally on another would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, where the US is the major partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that Trump's announcement of a \"framework\" came after he met Mark Rutte has prompted some concern in Greenland that negotiations on their future were being conducted in their absence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said his government had not asked him to negotiate on their behalf but to convey \"the red lines directly to President Trump\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rutte has not confirmed this has been the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been criticised for the praise he has constantly showered on President Trump.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why does Trump want Greenland?
