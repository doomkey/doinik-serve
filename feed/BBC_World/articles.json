A vapour barrier is placed on top of the insulation, before engineers lay mats containing glycol on top to keep the ice cold.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Boards and glass walls are then placed around the rink and then roughly another five centimetres of water is added above the mat - this is when the ice sheets are created.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The surface is painted white and sealed, with ice hockey markings and logos added.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Finally, the rink is topped with three to four centimetres of water to create the playing field. Temperatures are kept between -5 and -4C.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Resurfacing machines, colloquially known as Zambonis, are sent out regularly to shave away ice and form a new smooth layer.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Ice master Mark Messer, who is overseeing the long track speed skating said the hardest part is \"working with a new system for such a high profile event, with little time for preparation\".</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He added that although ice has been made on temporary settings, it has not been done on this scale for an Olympic Games.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Milan-Cortina will be the first time a temporary venue has been used for long track speed skating at a Winters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Darnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Was it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">No quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Luck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">None have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages. </p></div></div></body></html>"
