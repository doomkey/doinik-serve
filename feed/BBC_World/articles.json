New footage published by the News Movement and shared with BBC News shows an altercation between Pretti and federal officers 11 days before his death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the family has confirmed the man in the video is Pretti. In a separate statement released to media, the family's lawyer said \"nothing that happened a full week before could possibly have justified Alex's killing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC analysis editor Ros Atkins examines this new footage - and explains how Trump changed course on Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"produced-by-katerina-karelli.-verification-by-benedict-garman.-graphics-by-waleed-al-temimi.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Produced by Katerina Karelli.
