But this declaration is notable for its candour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The signatories are the foreign ministers of the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The statement begins by declaring that \"the war in Gaza must end now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It then warns: \"The suffering of civilians in Gaza has reached new depths. The Israeli government's aid delivery model is dangerous, fuels instability and deprives Gazans of human dignity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We condemn the drip feeding of aid and the inhumane killing of civilians, including children, seeking to meet their most basic needs of water and food. It is horrifying that over 800 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy later told the House of Commons a \"litany of horrors\" was taking place in Gaza, including strikes that have killed \"desperate, starving children\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing an extra £40m of humanitarian assistance for Gaza this year, Lammy said he was \"a steadfast supporter of Israel's security and its right to exist\" but the government's actions were \"doing untold damage to Israel's standing in the world and undermining Israel's long-term security\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: UN Secretary General spokesperson says Gaza's 'last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing'</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A spokesperson for the UN Secretary General António Guterres said he was \"appalled\" by the increasingly dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza, and that the \"last lifelines to keep people alive are collapsing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Israel has the obligation to allow and facilitate by all means at its disposal the humanitarian relief provided by the United Nations,\" the spokesperson said. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being killed while waiting for food since May, when Israel partially eased an 11-week total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza and, along with the US, helped to establish a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) to bypass the existing one overseen by the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has said the GHF's system, which uses US private security contractors to hand out food parcels from sites inside Israeli military zones, prevents supplies being stolen by Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the UN and its partners have refused to co-operate with the system, saying it is unsafe and violates the humanitarian principles of impartiality, neutrality, and independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last Tuesday, the UN human rights office said it had recorded 674 killings in the vicinity of the GHF's aid sites since they began operating eight weeks ago. Another 201 killings had been recorded along routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday, another 39 people were killed near two GHF sites in Khan Younis and nearby Rafah, according to Gaza's health ministry. The Israeli military said its troops fired warning shots to prevent \"suspects\" approaching them before the sites opened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And on Sunday, the ministry said 67 people were killed as they surged toward a convoy of UN aid lorries near a crossing point in northern Gaza. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots at a crowd \"to remove an immediate threat\" but disputed the numbers killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Following the incident, the World Food Programme warned that Gaza's hunger crisis had \"reached new levels of desperation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People are dying from lack of humanitarian assistance. Malnutrition is surging with 90,000 women and children in urgent need of treatment,\" the UN agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Monday that 19 people had died as a result of malnutrition since Saturday and warned of potential \"mass deaths\" in the coming days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hospitals can no longer provide food for patients or staff, many of whom are physically unable to continue working due to extreme hunger,\" Dr Khalil al-Daqran, a spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hospitals cannot provide a single bottle of milk to children suffering from hunger, because all baby formula has run out from the market,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Residents also reported that markets were closed due to food shortages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My children cry from hunger all night. They've had only a small plate of lentils over the past three days. There's no bread. A kilogramme of flour was $80 (£59) a week ago,\" Mohammad Emad al-Din, a barber and father of two, told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d53e/live/035d49d0-6669-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters Palestinian mother Alaa al-Najjar mourns her three-month-old baby Yehia, who died due to malnutrition amid a hunger crisis, according to medics, at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza (20 July 2025)\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Medics at Nasser hospital in southern Gaza said Alaa al-Najjar's three-month-old baby son, Yehia, died as a result of malnutrition</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The statement by the 27 countries also says Israeli proposals to move Gaza's entire 2.1 million into a so-called \"humanitarian city\" in the southern Rafah area are unacceptable, noting that \"permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They urge Israel, Hamas and the international community to \"bring this terrible conflict to an end, through an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And they warn that they are \"prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and a political pathway to security and peace\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That is seen by many as code for recognising a state of Palestine, something many countries have done but not all, including the UK and France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein rejected the criticism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All statements and all claims should be directed at the only party responsible for the lack of a deal for the release of hostages and a ceasefire: Hamas, which started this war and is prolonging it,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Instead of agreeing to a ceasefire, Hamas is busy running a campaign to spread lies about Israel. At the same time, Hamas is deliberately acting to increase friction and harm to civilians who come to receive humanitarian aid,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military said earlier this month that it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed while seeking aid and that it was working to minimise \"possible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military body responsible for co-ordinating aid, Cogat, also said on Monday that Israel \"acts in accordance with international law and is leading efforts to facilitate the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza in co-ordination with the international organisations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A spokesperson for the GHF meanwhile appealed to UN agencies to join its operation while also blaming them for \"stopping\" work and for failing to deliver supplies across the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chapin Fay told journalists that he had been to border crossings where he saw aid supplies \"rotting\" because UN agencies would not deliver them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli foreign ministry said on Sunday that 700 lorry loads of aid were waiting to be picked up by the UN from crossings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN has said it struggles to pick up and distribute supplies because of the ongoing hostilities, Israeli restrictions on humanitarian movements, and fuel shortages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 59,029 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A statement from his two living children condemned \"any attempts to misuse these documents in ways intended to undermine our father's legacy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">King, a Baptist minister, was shot in Memphis on 4 April 1968, at age 39.

Tributes swiftly poured in from celebrities, including Questlove, Jennifer Hudson, Taraji P Henson, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Magic Johnson. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Authorities said bystanders rescued Warner and brought him to shore, where the Costa Rican Red Cross tried to treat him, but he was declared dead at the scene. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is survived by his wife and daughter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Warner was Emmy-nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a comedy series for his work on The Cosby Show in 1986.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was handpicked for his breakout role by Cosby on the final day of a nationwide audition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I was literally the last person they saw,\" he recalled in a 2023 interview. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Cosby Show ranked as the number one TV show for five seasons from 1985-90. It portrayed a cosy middle-class family - a relatively rare depiction at the time of  black Americans on television. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the show first came out, there were white people and black people talking about [how] the Huxtables don't really exist, black people don't really live like that,\" Warner said in a 2013 interview. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Meanwhile, we were getting tens of thousands of fan letters from people saying, 'Thank you so much for this show.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After The Cosby Show, Warner appeared in several other television programmes including Malcom &amp; Eddie, alongside comedian Eddie Griffin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Griffin paid respects to him on social media after his death, writing \"R.I.P.

I'm so sorry for this unimaginable loss.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Actress Taraji P Henson posted: \"Malcolm, we grew up with you. Thank you for the art, the wisdom, the grace you gave us!!!!! </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You left the world better than you found it. Rest easy, king!!!! Your legacy lives far beyond the screen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Actress Niecy Nash posted that she had recently spoken to Warner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We talked about how happy we both were in our marriages.

They had also emphasised the \"need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India plans to build a hydropower dam on the Siang river, which would act as a buffer against sudden water releases from China's dam and prevent flooding in their areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's foreign ministry has previously responded to India, saying in 2020 that China has a \"legitimate right\" to dam the river and has considered downstream impacts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bangladesh also expressed concerns to China about the project, with officials in February sending a letter to Beijing requesting more information on the dam.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3a22/live/badd5300-6602-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A birds eye view of the Yarlung Tsangpo river and one of its many river bends, showing verdant greenery and mountain peaks in the distance\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The Yarlung Tsangpo river courses through the Tibetan plateau</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Chinese authorities have long eyed the hydropower potential of the dam's location in the Tibet Autonomous Region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's in a massive canyon that is said to be the world's deepest and longest on land, along a section where the Yarlung Tsangpo - Tibet's longest river - makes a sharp U-turn around the Namcha Barwa mountain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the process of making this turn - which has been termed \"the Great Bend\" - the river drops hundreds of metres in its elevation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier reports indicated that authorities planned to drill multiple 20km-long tunnels through the Namcha Barwa mountain, via which they would divert part of the river.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the weekend a Xinhua report on Li Qiang's visit said that engineers would conduct \"straightening\" work and \"divert water through tunnels\" to build five cascading power stations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Xinhua also reported that the hydropower dam's electricity would be mainly transmitted out of the region to be used elsewhere, while accommodating for Tibet's needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China has been eyeing the steep valleys and mighty rivers in the rural west - where Tibetan territories are located - to build mega-dams and hydropower stations that can sustain the country's electricity-hungry eastern metropolises.

It then developed a technical snag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Its prolonged presence on Indian soil sparked curiosity and raised questions about how such a modern aircraft could remain stranded in a foreign country for so long.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the plane, which was part of the fleet of HMS Prince of Wales, was unable to return, engineers from the Royal Navy's flagship carrier visited it to fix it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But they were unable to repair it, and a fortnight back, the UK ministry of defence <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/UKDefenceIndia/status/1942145462804636057\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">said</a> they had deployed a team of 14 engineers \"to Thiruvananthapuram airport to assess and repair the F-35B aircraft\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The team came with specialist equipment necessary for the movement and repair process, a statement said. Videos from the time showed the F-35B being towed away to a hangar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There had been speculation that if the technicians failed to repair the aircraft, it would have to be dismantled and carried out in a bigger cargo plane such as a C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the past two weeks, the UK high commission in India and the defence authorities have responded to the BBC's messages saying they would not share details of repairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on Monday, an airport official told the BBC that \"the aircraft is confirmed to be airworthy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is scheduled to be pulled out of the hangar on Monday morning, he said, adding that the exact time of its departure is \"yet to be communicated, which airport will be used for refuelling on the way to London or when the backup aircraft will arrive to transport the technicians and equipment back\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">F-35Bs are highly advanced stealth jets, built by Lockheed Martin, and are prized for their short take-off and vertical landing capability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Images of the \"lonely F-35B\", parked on the tarmac and soaked by the Kerala monsoon rains, made it a subject of jokes and memes with many suggesting that it did not want to leave the scenic state of Kerala, described as \"God's own country\" in tourism brochures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case of the stranded $110m (£80m) jet was also raised in the House of Commons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a></p></div></div></body></html>"

Video showed the plane making a belly landing - without landing gear - and skidding along the runway into a concrete barrier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The aircraft's two engines were sent to France in March for analysis. The recent findings from South Korea's Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board found that a pilot had turned off the left engine - which had no defects - instead of the right engine, which was severely damaged by the bird strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, families of the victims said that the report did not mention the concrete barrier at the end of the runway, which they argued is what made the accident so devastating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The bereaved families seek a fair and transparent investigation into the accident,\" they said in a statement, and urged investigators to conduct a press briefing \"only after a full and careful examination has been completed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement on Sunday, the Jeju Air pilots' union similarly criticised the recent findings for allegedly focusing on pilots' misjudgement and downplaying other contributing factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A source with knowledge of the probe, however, told Reuters that investigators would not change their findings as they had \"clear evidence and backup data\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Following the crash, South Korea's transport ministry said in January that it would remove concrete barriers at seven airports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, families of the victims lodged a criminal complaint against Jeju Air chief executive Kim E-bae, citing professional negligence. Mr Kim is among 24 people being investigated over the accident.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For, despite the measured tone of the report, one detail continues to haunt investigators, aviation analysts and the public alike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Seconds after take-off, both fuel-control switches on the 12-year-old Boeing 787 abruptly moved to \"cut-off\", cutting fuel to the engines and causing total power loss - a step normally done only after landing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The cockpit voice recording captures one pilot asking the other why he \"did the cut-off\", to which the person replies that he didn't. The recording doesn't clarify who said what. At the time of take-off, the co-pilot was flying the aircraft while the captain was monitoring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The switches were returned to their normal inflight position, triggering automatic engine relight. At the time of the crash, one engine was regaining thrust while the other had relit but had not yet recovered power. The plane was airborne for less than a minute before crashing into a neighbourhood in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several speculative theories have emerged since the preliminary report - a full report is expected in a year or so. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/air-india-crash-senior-pilot-eab72db5\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">The Wall Street Journal</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/air-india-cockpit-recording-suggests-captain-cut-fuel-engines-before-crash-2025-07-18/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Reuters</a> news agency have reported that \"new details in the probe of last month's Air India crash are shifting the focus to the senior pilot in the cockpit\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Italian newspaper <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.corriere.it/economia/trasporti/aerei/25_luglio_18/air-india-comandante-trappola-2db9160e-9395-4daf-8746-fa0278faaxlk.shtml\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Corriere della Sera</a> claimed that its sources had told them the first officer repeatedly asked the captain why he \"shut off the engines\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, was the captain on the flight, while Clive Kunder, 32, was the co-pilot who was flying the plane. Together, the two pilots had more than 19,000 hours of flight experience - nearly half of it on the Boeing 787.  Both had passed all pre-flight health checks before the crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Understandably, the wave of speculative leaks has rattled investigators and angered Indian pilots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), the lead investigator, stated in a release that \"certain sections of the international media are repeatedly attempting to draw conclusions through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aaib.gov.in/What's%20New%20Assets/APPEAL%20VT-ANB%2017-07-2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">selective and unverified reporting</a>\". It described these \"actions [as] irresponsible, especially while the investigation remains ongoing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jennifer Homendy, chairwoman of the US's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is assisting the investigation, said on X that the media reports were <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/1946299060060610699\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">\"premature and speculative\"</a> and that “investigations of this magnitude take time\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in India, the Indian Commercial Pilots' Association condemned the rush to blame the crew as \"reckless\" and \"deeply insensitive\", urging restraint until the final report is out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sam Thomas, head of the Airline Pilots' Association of India (ALPA India), told the BBC that \"speculation has triumphed over transparency\", emphasising the need to review the aircraft's maintenance history and documentation alongside the cockpit voice recorder data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the heart of the controversy is the brief cockpit recording in the report - the full transcript, expected in the final report, should shed clearer light on what truly happened. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A Canada-based air accident investigator, who preferred to remain unnamed, said that the excerpt of the conversation in the report presents at several possibilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example, \"if pilot 'B' was the one who operated the switches - and did so unwittingly or unconsciously - it's understandable that they would later deny having done it,\" the investigator said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But if pilot 'A' operated the switches deliberately and with intent, he may have posed the question knowing full well that the cockpit voice recorder would be scrutinised, and with the aim of deflecting attention and avoiding identification as the one responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Even if the AAIB is eventually able to determine who said what, that doesn't decisively answer the question 'Who turned the fuel off?'\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We may even never know the answer to that question.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigators told the BBC that while there appeared to be strong evidence the fuel switches were manually turned off, it's still important to keep \"an open mind\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A glitch in the plane's Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) system - which monitors engine health and performance - could, in theory, trigger an automatic shutdown if it receives false signals from sensors, some pilots suggest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, if the pilot's exclamation - 'why did you cut-off [the fuel]?' - came after the switches moved to cut-off (as noted in the preliminary report), it would undermine that theory. The final report will likely include time-stamped dialogue and a detailed analysis of engine data to clarify this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speculation has been fuelled less by who said what, and more by what wasn't said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The preliminary report withheld the full cockpit voice recorder (CVR) transcript, revealing only a single, telling line from the final moments. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This selective disclosure has raised questions: was the investigation team confident about the speakers' identities but chose to withhold the rest out of sensitivity? Or are they still uncertain whose voices they were hearing and needed more time to fully investigate the matter before publishing any conclusions?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Peter Goelz, former NTSB managing director, says the AAIB should release a voice recorder transcript with pilot voices identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If any malfunctions began during take-off, they would be recorded in the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and would likely have triggered alerts in the flight management system - alerts the crew would almost certainly have noticed and, more importantly, discussed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigators are urging restraint in drawing conclusions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to be cautious because it's easy to assume that if the switches were turned off, it must mean intentional action - pilot error, suicide, or something else. And that's a dangerous path to go down with the limited information we have,\" Shawn Pruchnicki, a former airline accident investigator and aviation expert at Ohio State University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, alternative theories continue to circulate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Indian newspapers including the Indian Express flagged a possible <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/ai-crash-probe-looks-for-vital-clues-of-electric-malfunction-in-tail-wreckage-10137487/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">electrical fire in the tail</a> as a key focus. But the preliminary report makes clear: the engines shut down because both fuel switches were moved to cut-off - a fact backed by recorder data. If a tail fire occurred, it likely happened post-impact, triggered by spilled fuel or damaged batteries, an independent investigator said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, AAIB chief GVG Yugandhar stressed that the preliminary report aims to \"provide information about 'WHAT' happened\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's too early for definite conclusions,\" he said, emphasising the investigation is ongoing and the final report will identify \"root causes and recommendations\". He also pledged to share updates on \"technical or public interest matters\" as they arise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Summing up, Mr Pruchnicki said the probe \"boils down to two possibilities - either deliberate action or confusion, or an automation-related issue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The report doesn't rush to blame human error or intent; there's no proof it was done intentionally,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other words, no smoking gun - just an uneasy wait for answers that may never even fully emerge.</p></div></div></body></html>"

All made possible by new technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a world away from his early career, when he was transporting fruit and wine, he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Back in the day, you had to sit by a payphone if you're on the road and start calling people you've worked with and then you'd have a pager.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today, you just turn on your devices and scan through possible work. It's all digital and you get paid instantly. It's much better for business.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The change has been driven by \"Uberised\" platforms, digitally matching truckers with companies which need to move freight. The phrase was coined due to the similarity to the ride hailing app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Jared agrees it has made things easier, the truck driver says it has led to wages falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"During Covid, the average was $3 (£2.24) per mile, today on some loads from Toronto to Los Angeles that is $1.10 per mile.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not to mention, he says, the rising cost of fuel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Canada, eight major platforms including Uber Freight, have emerged to digitise the market for freight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Like the taxi app, they are capitalising on a fragmented market dominated by smaller players, with 2023 data suggesting that more than eight in 10 trucking and freight firms in Canada employ fewer than five people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Christopher Monette, from Teamsters Canada, told the BBC that the Canadian Trade Union representing over 130,000 members including truckers, has \"deep concerns around the efforts to 'Uberise' the trucking sector\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Wages in Canada have remained largely stagnant for the past 25 years, and the rise of gig-style work stands to make things even worse,\" he argues, adding that \"larger, often unionised carriers who operate responsibly by investing in safety, training, and decent working conditions are most at risk\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Truckers don't need another app. We need stronger protections and bigger paycheques.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked, Uber Freight did not directly address the issue of wages and prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, a spokesperson said: \"Flexibility, transparency, and choice are built directly into our platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Carriers can search for loads based on their preferences, such as lane, equipment type, commodity, and schedule, and either book instantly at a listed price or submit a bid for a rate that better aligns with their needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the trucking industry a lane refers to a regularly travelled route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our platform also uses real-time market data and AI-powered recommendations to help carriers make the most of their time on the road,\" the spokesperson said. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Eric Beckwitt's firm is using AI to speed up complicated bookings</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Vancouver-based Freightera is among the biggest players when it comes to digital trucking services in Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Co-founder Eric Beckwitt meets me at a point overlooking the city's sprawling port, where towering orange cranes move brightly coloured containers against a backdrop of snow-topped mountains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When he started the company in 2014, there were no trucking apps for Canadian companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The service he has developed allows drivers and customers to search 20 billion regular routes for hauling freight which, he says, can be done in \"five or 10 seconds\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He points out that, unlike other platforms, Freightera does not set prices. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At Freightera, carriers set their own price.

Before services like his came along, finding work, or even the best route, was like \"finding a needle in a haystack\", the Freightera boss explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Carriers really appreciate Freightera's reliable demand for service, which has grown every year consistently, right through Covid, the inflation afterwards and the current freight recession, one of the largest running freight downtowns,\" he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The company is now developing AI to speed up complicated bookings: \"Digging through the noisy, messy documents, fine print and inconsistent rules - things like missing paperwork, unexpected charges, or a routing issue that could throw off delivery.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Beckwitt also dreams of a completely automated freight industry, \"40 years from now\", where AI would control global freight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Automatically assigning cargo to networks with the lowest capacity and allowing complete transparency, tracking and even trading while they're in travel\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d138/live/f5c5dfd0-5281-11f0-a2ff-17a82c2e8bc4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A big red truck on the Nairobi Expressway along the Mombasa road\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Around three quarters of Kenyan freight is moved by trucks</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Digital trucking services are employed all over the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kenya heavily relies on road freight, so has embraced the new tech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Over 75% of inland freight is moved by road and in many cases it's the only mode of transportation available,\" says Jean-Claude Homawoo, co-founder of Africa's biggest digitised freight platform, LORI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since launching in 2016, LORI has grown its network to 20,000 trucks.

Alberta, the province at the epicentre of the current outbreak, has the highest per capita measles spread rate in North America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The data raises questions on why the virus is spreading more rapidly in Canada than in the US, and whether Canadian health authorities are doing enough to contain it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the US, the rise of measles has been partly linked to vaccine-hesitant public figures, like Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr - although he has since endorsed the measles vaccine as safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Canada does not have a prominent RFK Jr-like figure in public health, noted Maxwell Smith, a professor of public health at Western University in southern Ontario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There are other things that need to be interrogated here I think,\" Dr Smith said. \"Looking at the Canadian context adds another layer of complexity to this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Measles overall is on the rise in North America, Europe and the UK. Cases in the US reached a 33-year high this year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/measles-epidemiology-2023/confirmed-cases-of-measles-in-england-by-month-age-region-and-upper-tier-local-authority-2025\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">while England reported nearly 3,000 confirmed infections in 2024</a>, its highest count since 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canada's 2025 figures have surpassed both. The country has not seen this many measles cases since the illness was declared eliminated in 1998. Before this year, the last peak was in 2011, when about 750 cases were reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The MMR vaccine is the most effective way to fight off measles, a highly contagious and dangerous virus, which can lead to pneumonia, brain swelling and death. The jabs are 97% effective and also immunise against mumps and rubella.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fb3c/live/156094c0-632b-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Morgan Birch A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Morgan Birch</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A photo of Kimie with a visible red rash on her body, a common symptom of measles.</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How measles spread in Canada</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The hardest-hit provinces have been Ontario and Alberta, followed by Manitoba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Ontario, health authorities say the outbreak began in late 2024, when an individual contracted measles at a large Mennonite gathering in New Brunswick and then returned home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mennonites are a Christian group with roots in 16th-Century Germany and Holland, who have since settled in other parts of the world, including Canada, Mexico and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some live modern lifestyles, while conservative groups lead simpler lives, limiting the use of technology and relying on modern medicine only when necessary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Ontario, the illness primarily spread among Low German-speaking Mennonite communities in the province's southwest, where vaccination rates have historically been lower due to some members' religious or cultural beliefs against immunisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Almost all those infected were unvaccinated, according to data from Public Health Ontario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Catalina Friesen, a healthcare worker at a mobile clinic serving the Mennonite population near Aylmer, Ontario, said she first became aware of the outbreak in February, when a woman and her five-year-old child came in with what appeared to be an ear infection. It later turned out to be a symptom of measles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is the first time I've ever seen measles within our community,\" Ms Friesen told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cases spread rapidly from that point, reaching a peak of more than 200 a week across Ontario by late April.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While new confirmed cases have since dropped sharply in Ontario, Alberta has emerged as the next hotspot. There, the spread happened so quickly that health officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how or where the outbreak began, said Dr Vivien Suttorp, the medical officer of health in southern Alberta, where cases are the highest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She, too, said she had not seen an outbreak this bad in her 18 years working in public health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Friesen noted that Canada has a higher concentration of conservative Low German-speaking Mennonites than the US, which may be a factor behind the higher number of cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mennonites are not a monolith, she said, and many have embraced vaccinations. What's changed is the rapid spread of anti-vaccine misinformation both in her community and beyond after the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's hearsay that immunisations are bad for you,\" Ms Friesen said, or are \"dangerous\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This is amplified by a general distrust in the healthcare system, which she said has historically ostracised members of her community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are sometimes put down or looked down upon because of our background,\" she said, adding that she herself has experienced discrimination in hospitals based on assumptions about her beliefs.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Vaccine hesitancy on the rise</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Experts say it's tough to pinpoint why measles have spread wider in Canada than in the US, but many agree that cases in both countries are likely underreported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The numbers that we have in Alberta are just the tip of the iceberg,\" said Dr Suttorp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is one big reason driving the outbreak: low vaccination rates, said Janna Shapiro, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto's Centre for Vaccine Preventable Diseases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Shapiro said there is \"an element of chance\" at play, where a virus is introduced to a community by accident and spreads among those who are unprotected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The only thing that is going to stop an outbreak is getting those vaccination rates up,\" she said. \"If the public is not willing to get vaccinated, then it will continue until the virus can't find anymore receptible hosts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In general, studies show that vaccine hesitancy has risen in Canada since the pandemic, and the data reflects that. In southern Alberta, for example, the number of MMR vaccines administered has dropped by nearly half from 2019 to 2024, according to provincial figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Covid-19 vaccine mandates were fiercely opposed by some during the pandemic, prompting the so-called \"Freedom Convoy\" protest in Ottawa where truckers gridlocked the city for two weeks in 2021.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That opposition has since expanded to other vaccines, said Dr Shapiro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pandemic-related disruptions also left some children behind on routine immunisations. With measles having been largely eliminated, families likely did not prioritise getting their kids' vaccinations up to date, Dr Shapiro said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That is not the case for Ms Birch, who began routine immunisations for her baby Kimie as soon as she was eligible. But Kimie was still too young for the measles vaccine, which is typically given at 12 months in Alberta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Suttorp said Alberta has since lowered that age cap in response to the recent outbreak, and there has been an uptick in people taking the vaccine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Health units across the country have also tried to encourage people to get vaccinated through public bulletins and radio advertisements. But the response is notably more muted than that during the Covid-19 pandemic, health officials say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kimie has since slowly recovered, Ms Birch said, though she continues to be monitored for potential long-term effects of the virus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Alberta mother said she was saddened and horrified when she learned her daughter had measles, but also \"frustrated and annoyed\" at those choosing not to vaccinate their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She called on people to heed public health guidelines and \"protect the ones that can't protect themselves\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My four-month-old shouldn't have gotten measles in 2025,\" Ms Birch said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Spring greens are known as \"sukumawiki\", meaning \"stretch the week\" in Swahili, reflecting how they have become a daily staple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But diners in Gachie are part of the growing wave of Kenyans who see the benefits of eating local, organically produced nutrient-rich varieties of greens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It detoxifies the body and is good in weight loss,\" says James Wathiru, who ordered \"managu\" - or African nightshade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another person told me: \"It's all about its taste, which is better.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to horticulture professor Mary Abukutsa-Onyango, this trend is reflected in government data and some of the health benefits are backed by research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the last 10 years, production of local greens has doubled - with 300,000 tonnes produced by local farmers last year, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a remarkable change in attitudes, given people used to look down on traditional crops as inferior - not realising they were often more resistant to diseases and pests, meaning they can be grown organically.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the 1980s, when Prof Abukutsa-Onyango began her studies, she says she was perplexed to find them referred to as \"weeds\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We never learnt about African indigenous vegetables. They were calling amaranth 'pigweed' [and] spider plant, they were calling it 'spider weed',\" she tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her postgraduate research on traditional plants was also tricky as there was no literature about them, but she persevered and now works with the government to promote them for food security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She says managu and other local vegetables like \"mrenda\" (jute mallow) and \"terere\" (amaranth) have more essential minerals than sukumawiki, as well as \"higher levels of vitamin A and C [and] antioxidants\" that boost immunity and reduce the risk of disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some varieties also contain protein, making them an excellent option for vegetarians. She notes for instance that 100g (3.5 ounces) of mrenda - known for its distinctive slimy texture when cooked - contains more nutrients than a similar portion of common cabbage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The progress people like Prof Abukutsa-Onyango have made in promoting the diversity and knowledge of indigenous vegetables was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ich.unesco.org/en/BSP/success-story-of-promoting-traditional-foods-and-safeguarding-traditional-foodways-in-kenya-01409\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">acknowledged by Unesco in 2021,</a> when the UN cultural agency commended the East African nation for the \"safeguarding of intangible cultural heritage\" that had been threatened by \"historical factors and the pressures of modern lifestyles\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It noted that Kenya had begun a project in 2007 involving scientists and local communities to record an inventory of traditional foods, which now includes 850 indigenous plants and their local names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of these vegetables are eaten nationwide, while others are specific to certain areas or communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But sukumawiki, first introduced to Kenya from the Mediterranean as animal feed, is still favoured by many farmers - with more than 700,000 tonnes produced in 2023 - more than double the volume of all indigenous leafy vegetables combined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Francis Ngiri, who used to farm in Kirinyaga in central Kenya where cabbages are a mainstay crop, explains that this is because, especially during the 1970s, those growing imported leafy vegetables used fertilisers and pesticides that damaged the local biodiversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, he tells the BBC, only the introduced varieties thrive as the soil has become too acidic to support many native species.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Sukumawiki is often paired with ugali, a type of maize porridge popular in Kenya</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Determined to do something so they would not be lost forever, Mr Ngiri moved his operation to Kenya's Rift Valley - an area he considers relatively untouched by chemical contamination - so he could practise organic farming of indigenous crops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On a four-acre (1.6 hectare) farm in Elementaita, he began with 14 native varieties in 2016.
