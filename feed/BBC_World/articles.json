The BBC has asked DHS for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The proposal says \"the data element will require <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">ESTA applicants</a> to provide their social media from the last 5 years\", without giving further details of which specific information will be required.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The existing ESTA requires a comparatively limited amount of information from travellers, as well as a one-off payment of $40 (£30). It is accessible to citizens of about 40 countries - including the UK, Ireland, France, Australia and Japan - and allows them to visit the US multiple times during a two-year period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as the collection of social media information, the new document proposes the gathering of an applicant's telephone numbers and email addresses used over the last five and 10 years respectively, and more information about their family members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The text cites an executive order from Trump in January, titled \"Protecting the United States From Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration previously announced it would examine social media accounts when vetting foreign nationals who apply for student visas or H1B visas for skilled workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state department said it will conduct \"online presence\" reviews for applicants and their dependents, and that privacy settings on all social media profiles must be made \"public\" so this screening can take place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An announcement on the website for the US Embassy and Consulate in Mexico states certain visa applicants must list all social media usernames or handles of every platform they have used in the last five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It warns that if any social media information is not listed, it could lead to both current and future visas being denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior state department official said of the student visa policy: \"It is an expectation from American citizens that their government will make every effort to make our country safer, and that is exactly what the Trump Administration is doing every single day.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officers were instructed to screen for those \"who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to national security; or who perpetrate unlawful anti-Semitic harassment or violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the administration's broader effort to toughen borders, officials recently said an existing travel ban - affecting 19 countries in Africa, the Middle East and the Caribbean - could soon be expanded. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That move was announced in the wake of a shooting attack on two National Guard members in Washington DC, in which an Afghan man has been named as the suspect. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new proposal regarding ESTA data collection for tourists invites views from the public for 60 days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sophia Cope, of digital rights organisation the Electronic Frontier Foundation, criticised the plan, telling the New York Times that it could \"exacerbate civil liberties harms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, immigration law practice Fragomen suggested there could be practical impacts as applicants could face longer waits for ESTA approvals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have previously suggested that the changes to travel policies introduced under Trump have had an impact on the American tourism industry. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council said the US was the only one of 184 economies that it analysed that was expected to see a decline in international visitor spending in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Trump administration policies have also appeared to impact tourism to the country, such as many Canadians boycotting US travel as a form of protest against Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending more than $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.</p></div></div></body></html>"

event.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new raft of measures designed to protect the integrity of the vote was approved at an EBU summit last week, after which most countries confirmed they would travel to Vienna for the 2026 contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Icelandic broadcaster's board had previously approved a recommendation to ask the EBU to ban Israel from Eurovision 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iceland was reportedly among seven countries that then requsted a vote at the EBU general meeting on Israel's participation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That request was denied, and Israel's future participation was instead effectively tied to a ballot on the new voting and campaigning rules.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Icelandic broadcaster said that while the new measures addressed many of its concerns, it \"believes that there are still doubts whether the agreed adjustments would be fully satisfactory\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"RÚV has repeadly raised concerns that various Icelandic stakeholders, such as artist associations and the general public, were opposed to participation in the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Furthermore, RÚV had requested the EBU to exclude [Israeli public broadcaster] KAN from the contest in accordance to precedents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a complex matter which has already damaged the contest's reputation and EBU, emphasizing the necessity of a solution for all concerned parties.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

He cited a new law passed by Congress requiring the justice department to release files about Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his latest ruling, Judge Berman said the victims have the right to \"have their identity and privacy protected\", adding that their \"safety and privacy are paramount\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esptein was charged with sex trafficking in July 2019.

On Tuesday, another judge made a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8e2kvzen7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">similar ruling in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell,</a> who was convicted in 2021 for her role in facilitating Epstein's abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During her trial, prosecutors argued Maxwell recruited and groomed girls, some as young as 14, between 1994 and 2004, before they were abused by Epstein.

We are returning home.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The audience in City Hall, which included members of Norway's royal family, gave Ms Sosa a long round of applause and a standing ovation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There had been much speculation about whether Machado, who has been living in hiding, would be able to defy a travel ban to attend the ceremony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an audio recording shared by the Nobel Institute, Machado said: \"I will be in Oslo, I am on my way.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the director of the Nobel Institute, Kristian Berg Harpviken, said she was expected to arrive \"sometime between this evening and tomorrow morning\" - too late for the ceremony. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Wednesday, the Nobel Institute had said they were in the dark about Machado's whereabouts, triggering concern among her supporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as her daughter Ana, Machado's two other children, her mother and her three sisters are all in Oslo waiting to be reunited with her. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last time she was seen in public was on 9 January when she spoke to her supporters at a rally protesting against the swearing-in of Nicolás Maduro to a third term as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The elections were widely dismissed both by the opposition in Venezuela and on the international stage as rigged, and sparked protests across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 2,000 people were arrested in the crackdown which followed, among them many members of Machado's opposition coalition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado, who had managed to unite the bitterly divided opposition ahead of the election, went into hiding for fear of arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued to give interviews and uploaded videos to social media urging her followers not to give up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her Nobel Peace Prize win galvanised supporters and triggered immediate speculation as to whether she would be able to travel to Oslo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Total secrecy has surrounded her travel plans and it is not known how she managed to leave her place of hiding or by what means she has reached Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before she left Venezuela she told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK: \"I want to assure every single Venezuelan that I will be back.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the streets of the capital Caracas, though, there were some who worried that it might not be easy for her to get back into Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maria, 66, told the BBC she feared that without Machado, her supporters  would be \"left unprotected\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem for her will be returning later,\" María explained, adding that her own grandchildren were outside the country \"precisely because of the problems we have\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the Nobel Committee awarded her the peace prize, it highlighted her \"civilian courage\", noting that \"despite serious threats against her life\" she had remained in the country, a choice which the committee said \"inspired millions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carlos, 49, said he hoped Machado would return after visiting Norway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's better for her to be here, inside. Since everyone has left and hasn't done anything. It's best for her to be here inside Venezuela,\" he said, criticising opposition leaders who have gone into exile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado's Nobel Peace Prize comes at a time of high tension between Maduro and the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has deployed warships to international waters off Venezuela and US President Donald Trump has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, reportedly giving him an ultimatum to leave Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also been carrying out strikes on boats in the Caribbean, accusing the alleged traffickers who are piloting them of trying to carry drugs from Venezuela to the US. Dozens of people have been killed in the controversial months-long campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Machado was told she had won the peace prize back in October, she spoke on the phone to Trump, who had made no secret of wanting to win the accolade himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado told the BBC that in the call she stressed \"how grateful the Venezuelan people are for what he's doing, not only in the Americas, but around the world for peace, for freedom, for democracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quizzed about the call by reporters, Trump said that \"I've been helping her along the way\" and described Machado as \"very nice\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado also appeared to back the US strikes on boats in the Caribbean - the legality of which has been questioned by experts on international law. She told the BBC that \"when you cut the inflows that come from drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, human trafficking, or the black market of oil, then the regime falls\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

200,000 people have fled their homes in eastern DR Congo since the latest round of fighting started early this month, the UN says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said at least 74 people had

Experts have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">raised questions over the legality of the strikes</a>, which have killed more than 80 people.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are the latest in a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cly1ydnq5n2t?post=asset%3A21821676-9496-4ef0-9ea8-ad46c19764b0#post\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked</a> since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean</a> in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leader of France's far-right National Rally (RN) Jordan Bardella has welcomed \"for the most part\" concerns raised about Europe in US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04vdengk3do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the White House published a document which outlined Trump's vision of the world</a> and the state of the European continent, which many have characterised as harshly critical of Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's Nick Robinson for his Political Thinking podcast, Bardella praised what he said was Trump's \"appeal to American pride\" - but he made clear he did not want Europe to be \"subservient to any major power\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said there was a \"wind of freedom, of national pride blowing all over Western democracies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a wide-ranging interview, the 30-year-old, who opinion polls suggest leads in the race to be France's next president, was also challenged on the RN's political history and his stance on immigration.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella said he shared the majority of the concerns outlined by the Trump administration about Europe facing \"civilisational erasure\", which the White House said is being fuelled by a range of policies, including on migration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mass immigration and the laxity of our governments in the last 30 years with regard to migration policy are shaking the balance of European countries, of Western societies, and namely French society,\" Bardella said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Snap parliamentary elections in June 2024 made the RN the largest single force in parliament, although an alliance of left-wing parties clinched victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next French presidential election is due to be held in 2027. A recent poll for Le Figaro suggests Bardella would win with 44% of the vote - just ahead of Marine Le Pen, the RN figurehead whose candidacy is in doubt after she was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and barred from standing in an election for five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An appeal due early next year will determine whether Le Pen can run - otherwise, the expectation is that Bardella will step in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella batted away suggestions this was sparking tensions between them, stating they were united by \"trust and friendship\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I will fight by her side so she can win the appeal. Until the appeal we will campaign together, as we will after, hand-in-hand,\" he said in his interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RN was founded by Le Pen's father Jean-Marie in 1972. Known then as the National Front (FN), it has since become a decisive force in French politics. Jean-Marie Le Pen was convicted several times for Holocaust denial and was an unrepentant extremist on race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his interview with Nick Robinson, Bardella distanced himself from Jean-Marie Le Pen's comments, as have many other RN politicians in recent years.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am fighting against the caricature of my political movement, of my ideas,\" he said, adding his responsibility was to bring together the French people and present the country with \"a project of national recovery\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My people's expectations for a break with the past are numerous,\" Bardella added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Challenged on the racist and antisemitic history of the RN's precursor, Bardella rejected accusations that the National Front had ever put forward arguments that could \"offend\" some sections of the population</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of Jewish people vote for us and consider us a bulwark against extremism,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RN is primarily known as an anti-immigration party and has long pushed for France to have stricter immigration rules, including limiting social spending to French citizens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If tomorrow I am the head of government, France will no longer be the target of mass immigration,\" he said, adding that if elected his first provision would be to trigger a referendum on immigration. \"It will allow us to take back control of our borders.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, according to the French constitution, a referendum can only be held on certain subjects which do not include immigration, so the constitution would have to be amended first. In order to do so, the RN would have to clinch the presidency and have either an absolute majority in Parliament or enough allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella - who grew up in the Paris region but himself has parents of immigrant origin - drew a clear distinction between people who he said were born in France but \"reject republican institutions like the police or values like secularism\", and others who \"do everything to become French - espouse the language, culture and national patrimony\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When pressed on what it means to be French if being born in the country is not sufficient, Bardella said he felt being French was an \"honour\" that transcended bureaucracy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Being French is adhering to some values and lifestyles, believing in equality between men and women,\" he argued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I defend secularism and I feel that Islamism has today become a separate political project... which wants to impose its rules on French society,\" Bardella added, before promising to close down radical mosques and banning \"hate preachers\" from the country if elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although he did not expand on France's frequent and longstanding financial woes - the country's debt is more than €3 trillion, or around 114% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Bardella said the French economy was \"sick\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We face two ailments – excessive taxation and excessive regulation,\" he said, promising to free the country from the \"shackles\" that limit growth. The RN has repeatedly voted down the yearly budgets put forward by governments since last year, and has promised to similarly vote down this year's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella's position on Ukraine also bears some differences with that of the current centrist government. While he stated Russia represented a \"multidimensional threat to French and European interests\", and that Kyiv will need security guarantees even in the event of a peace deal, he also said that he was \"firmly opposed\" to sending soldiers to Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emmanuel Macron's government, on the other hand, has proposed deploying a steady military presence, albeit far from the front line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But such a decision \"would contribute to an escalation,\" Bardella said, \"especially given that we have nuclear weapons and that President Putin has intentions whose limits are unclear\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Bardella does stand at the next presidential election and wins, he will be 31. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Macron was 39 when he became France's youngest ever president in 2017. While Macron was finance minister for two years under François Hollande, Bardella, in comparison, has never been in government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true I am 30 years old. Unfortunately I can't do anything about that,\" he argued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I recognise the existential questions facing our country... And I'd rather be told that today is 'too soon' rather than tomorrow is 'too late'.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Countries like Denmark, Malaysia, Singapore, Greece and Brazil are among those who have said they're looking at Australia as a test case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government has named 10 social media platforms as a start, including all of the most popular ones, but has also warned others it's coming for them next. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online safety regulator, Julie Inman Grant, said her agency will start checking compliance from Thursday. Parents and children won't be liable under this law, only social media firms, which face fines of up to A$49.5m ($33m, £24.5m) for serious breaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Tomorrow, I will issue information notices to the 10 major platforms and we will provide information to the public before Christmas on how these age restrictions are being implemented and whether, preliminarily, we see them working,\" she said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is broad agreement in Australia that social media companies are failing to shield users, particularly children, from harm on their platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tasmanian student Florence Brodribb - known as Flossie - told the press she believed the ban would help kids like her grow up \"healthier, safer, kinder, and more connected\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our brains are going through one of the biggest rewiring periods of our lives...

In April, the firm said sales had fallen to their lowest level in three years and warned investors that \"changing political sentiment\" could continue to hurt demand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Musk said he believed Doge had been \"a little bit successful, we were somewhat successful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You really want the least amount done by government as possible,\" he explained, adding that Doge had \"stopped a lot of funding that really just made no sense\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk told Miller that Doge, which was created by an executive order on Trump's first day back in the White House, was a \"made-up\" name \"based on internet suggestions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The advisory group, which is not an official government department, tackled Musk's vision at a fierce pace. It pushed for massive reductions in the federal workforce, as well as the shuttering of programmes and even agencies such as the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c307zq8ppj6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Agency for International Development</a> (USAID). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of Doge's moves were met with legal fights, or were reversed. When the group's cost-cutting resulted in bird flu officials at the US Department of Agriculture being fired, the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjev24184vjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump administration looked to re-hire them days later.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk's time at the helm of Doge not only appeared to cause issues for his business empire - it also led to an explosive falling-out with the president himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk donated millions of dollars to the Trump campaign during the election and was a fixture at the White House for months, speaking at cabinet meetings and standing behind the president at events in the Oval Office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that relationship came to a grinding halt in June when Musk broke with the White House narrative and criticised a Trump-backed spending bill. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It led to a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3wd2215q08o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">war of words on social media</a>, with Trump at one point threatening to order Doge to look into Musk's own business dealings with the US government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pair's relationship now seems to be mended. Musk was spotted at a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman in November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Musk spoke positively of Trump in his interview with Miller, saying the president was the funniest person he knows and has \"great sense of humour\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky, writing on X later on Tuesday, said Ukraine and Europe were working actively on \"all components of potential steps toward ending the war\", that the Ukrainian and European elements of the plan were now more developed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then told reporters he believed the plans would be submitted to the US on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's latest public criticism of Europe comes a day after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2k4z9nwz4yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">European leaders came together in London</a> to discuss their continued joint efforts to stop the fighting in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether Europe could help end the war, Trump said: \"They talk but they don't produce.

I think they don't know what to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's remarks came after his administration released its new 33-page National Security Strategy, which warned of Europe's potential \"civilisational erasure\" and questioned whether some nations could remain reliable allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia welcomed that strategy - which did not cast Russia as a threat to the US - as \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also warned on Tuesday many countries in Europe \"will not be viable countries any longer\" if they keep on the way they are going, adding: \"What they're doing with immigration is a disaster.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He singled out Hungary and Poland as doing a \"very good job\" on immigration, but said most European nations were \"decaying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding on Tuesday to the strategy, German chancellor Friedrich Merz said some parts were plausible and some understandable, but other elements were unacceptable from a European point of view. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He rejected the idea that the US needed to \"save democracy\" in Europe, saying Europeans could address such questions themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy also followed similar rhetoric to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c179p4wvz29o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump's speech to the UN earlier this year</a>, where he had harsh criticism for western Europe and its approach to migration and clean energy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We therefore cannot at this point provide any further information about when and how she will arrive for the Nobel peace prize ceremony.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado's family are already in Oslo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government has said that if she left Venezuela, Machado would be considered a \"fugitive\" by the authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's attorney general, Tarek William Saab, told AFP last month: \"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive\". He added that she is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had earlier told her followers that she would return to Venezuela after collecting the prize.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If she attends, it would be her first public appearance since the start of the year, when she went to a protest in Caracas on 9 January against the inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Venezuela's 2024 election, the opposition published tallies suggesting it won, despite Maduro claiming victory.

The bill is expected to pass with support from both parties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump says release of the video is something for Hegseth to decide.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump denied that he had previously said he would have \"no problem\" with the footage being made public - despite that comment being made on camera as recently as Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The threat from Congress to withhold money from Hegseth's travel budget has emerged amid a clamour for information from lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is buried within a 3,000-page draft bill that is focused on approving next year's defence spending. The annual bill authorises nearly $901bn in funding (£687m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill's final wording, which was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/12/08/ndaa-boat-strikes-congress-hegseth-without-funds-00680679\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">first reported by Politico</a>, states that Hegseth's office may spend no more than three-quarters of the funds made available for travel for the year 2026 until it meets certain requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include an obligation to give the House and Senate armed service committees all \"unedited video of strikes conducted against designated terrorist organizations in the area of responsibility of the United States Southern Command\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The wording nods to the way Trump has characterised his strikes on boats in the Caribbean and Pacific.

Dozens of people have been killed in the months-long campaign, but the administration has not publicly provided evidence for its assertions of criminality in each case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have raised questions about the legality of the strikes, prompting concern from Republicans and Democrats alike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regarding the \"double-tap\" attack on 2 September specifically, the experts point out that the so-called laws of war decree that the parties in an armed conflict are obliged to pick up wounded survivors of a strike rather than attack them again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nine people died in the first strike on the vessel and two survivors were left clinging to the burning wreckage when it was struck again, killing them, according to the Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has repeatedly said it is working within the laws of armed conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It says the second strike was ordered by a navy admiral, and not by Hegseth, who has become a focal point for scrutiny of both the strike and the White House narrative surrounding it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior members of Congress who were shown the video in a briefing last week by that admiral, Frank Bradley, emerged with differing views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jim Himes of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said he found the video of the second attack \"deeply, deeply troubling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas disagreed, calling the strikes \"entirely lawful and needful\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Lawmakers react to boat strike video showed in classified briefing</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously posted video of the first strike from 2 September, and continues to be asked whether he will release video of the second.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Wednesday, the president responded to an on-camera question about the video from an ABC News reporter by saying: \"I don't know what they have, but whatever they have, we'd certainly release, no problem.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five days later, he responded to a question from the same network by saying: \"I didn't say that.

The vast hinterland is her own backyard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet, like most teenagers, she's also attached to her smartphone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The all-terrain buggy she uses to herd cattle is fitted with an internet extender, enabling her to message friends on Snapchat while working. On days she gets a little bored, she likes to make funny TikTok videos with her siblings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With nearly all her friends living at least 100km away, social media is a lifeline. But not anymore, now that Australia's social media ban for children has taken effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Taking away our socials is just taking away how we talk to each other,\" Breanna says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While she can still text her friends, it's not the same as a quick \"snap\" or a \"like\" on a photo that allows her to play a part in their lives even when she is far away.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban has been in the making for a year now. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout, supporters have argued it's for the wellbeing of children who they say are spending too much time online and risk being exposed to uncontrollable pressures, bullying and predators. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents say restricting children's access to the internet runs the risk of pushing them to even less regulated corners of it - and they question the effectiveness of the age-verification tech the ban relies on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate is far from settled but Australia's experiment has now begun, and Breanna is among millions of children under the age of 16 who are no longer allowed to use social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And among them are children who are seen as both winning - saved from the potential dangers of social media - and losing out - no longer having the community and connections that may have been harder to forge offline.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Megan Easton with her daughters, Breanna and Olivia - Megan worries the government is overstepping with the ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Breanna's mum Megan Easton, the ban is a mixed blessing. While she agrees kids need to be protected, she remembers her own childhood on a cattle station was far more isolating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We did feel very behind the other children at school because we had a somewhat sheltered life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Breanna, her older sister Olivia and younger brother Jacob all did remote classes for children in the outback who are unable to attend a physical school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For senior grades though, boarding school is the only option for a good education. So from the age of 11 or 12, the siblings have lived six hours away from home during term-time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We might be incredibly geographically isolated but we're not digitally illiterate and we have taken great measures in our family to make sure that we educate our children appropriately for the world ahead of them,\" Ms Easton says. \"I do think that it is a bit of government overstepping.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of her concerns is that delaying access to social media to 16 takes away power from parents to educate their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Usually around 12 is when they start looking for their peers to be more influential than their parents,\" she says. \"Even though it's young to get them on social media, we've staged their experiences with it and it's a great opportunity for us to let them have a few mistakes and then talk them through the processes of self-correcting.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jacinta Hickey, 14, says she is old enough to know right from wrong</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 2,000km away, teens in Sydney lead very different, far more connected lives. But they share similar worries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a bit insulting that they think we can't handle it,\" says 14-year-old Jacinta Hickey who attends Rosebank College in Sydney's inner west. \"I'm definitely mature enough to distinguish right from wrong and to know what's good and bad for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her teachers though couldn't be happier. \"I feel really passionate that as long as we can, we should preserve the innocence that comes through childhood,\" says Iris Nastasi, the principal at Rosebank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When smartphones started becoming popular in the early 2000s, she thought it would be an opportunity to teach children about technology. She embraced the change. Twenty years later, Ms Nastasi thinks very differently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's two in the morning, he or she does something that they wouldn't normally do and the fallout happens here. Relationships are damaged and we have to look into it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At 12, Lola Farrugia isn't on social media yet - and with the new law, she now won't be for another four years. But that doesn't faze her.

The Anxious Generation was published in March 2024. By late November, a federal law banning social media for under-16s was passed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's still a High Court challenge brought by two teens pending, possible battles with tech firms and a warning from US President Donald Trump about targeting American companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course you think through the potential repercussions of any move like this,\" Malinauskas says. \"But when you are talking about protecting young people, all other considerations become secondary.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But one of the biggest criticisms of the law is that a blanket restriction could do the opposite for minority groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a survey of nearly 1,000 young people carried out by Minus18, a group that supports under-18 LGBTQ+ communities, 96% of respondents said social media was important to access friends and support, and 82% believed a ban would leave them disconnected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brisbane schoolgirl Sadie Angus is one of them. She turned 13 just a few weeks ago and opening an Instagram account was a rite of passage for her. But it was a short-lived one - the law means she's now being kicked off it and she's frustrated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can admit more things on there than I can in real life,\" says Sadie who often prefers to keep her anonymity online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I use it as a safe space to share what I've had to go through and since nobody knows who I am, they can't come to me in real life and talk about it and that feels kind of comforting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sadie's mother Kath felt it was an important step in her daughter - the youngest in their family - growing up and now that has been taken away from her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's being exposed to some really amazing role models through social media, particularly in the queer community which I think is really healthy for young adolescents,\" Ms Angus says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other minority groups have also voiced concern over the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am quite nervous about what this is going to mean for autistic young people,\" says Sharon Fraser, the CEO of Reframing Autism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We communicate and socialise differently,\" says Sharon who also has an autistic son. \"Online can be a very beneficial place for autistic people and there are ways to connect online that are just not accessible to them in real life.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: 'I don't need laws to teach my kids to be responsible', says Kath Angus</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For every young person who feels like they're losing out, campaigner Emma Mason thinks there will be far more winners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years ago, her daughter Tilly killed herself. She was 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emma blames the rise of social media for Tilly's death. Face-to-face bullying started when Tilly was just eight. It moved to messaging and then to platforms including Tiktok, Snapchat and Instagram. But it got worse after a fake image of Tilly was spread by children at her school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emma recalls how hysterical Tilly was when she found out: \"She was subject to something she had no control over, a harm that was instant, a harm that she could not stop. It was one of those moments in her life where she just lost it, she just thought I can't do this anymore, I can't keep fighting the demons.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mason doesn't want this to happen to other children, which is why she's been standing alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to support this law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These are agents of harm that are unregulated and I think our children have been the social experiment,\" Emma says. \"It's a government's job to protect the vulnerable of our society and to provide guardrails for how things need to go.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She admits though, for those who are already teenagers, they might not be clear winners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't know that we can save the children that have had access to it already,\" she says. \"But those children that are 13 and below that aren't supposed to be on it now, they won't have to grow up in a world where it's acceptable that you just get on social media and you can say what you want, how you want, to whoever you want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-simon-atkinson\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Simon Atkinson</i></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What do teenagers think about Australia's social media ban?</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Another suggested she couldn't be happy with a husband like that. Some labelled her a \"gold-digger,\" claiming she married him for wealth or a secure government job with perks. One comment suggested that Mr Rajput's father must be \"a government minister\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple, who married on 23 November, have since gone viral because of the trolling - and their response, as they addressed the criticism head-on. They have been sought out by local media and given scores of interviews in the past two weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People were making jokes and memes and it felt very wrong,\" Mr Rajput told BBC Hindi from his home in Jabalpur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was our moment and we had waited for it so many years.

When they say nasty things about him or call me a gold-digger, it irritates me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on Instagram, Mr Rajput addressed the trolls: \"Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not a government employee, but I work hard for my family and want to give them a good, dignified life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Sonali fell in love with him when he had nothing. \"From college till today, she has stood with me through every good and bad moment. People's negative opinions mean nothing to me,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput also addressed the issue of colourism in the comments, saying he had faced colour discrimination his whole life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I know very well that I have a dark complexion. But in my wife's eyes, I am trying to be the best husband I can be, and that is what matters the most. There is no need to speak wrongly about my family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput said he pushed back when the trolls began commenting on one of the photos that also had his mother and his and his wife's sisters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I did not like the fact that they targeted my family. I want to tell them, you are a nobody. And you have no right to target - or troll - anyone's family,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple, together since meeting in a 2014 college zoology class, say outsiders shouldn't judge their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our relationship began a year later and we knew from then that one day we would be married. Those who are commenting on our relationship by looking at a 30-second video don't know that it captures 11 years of hard work that we have put into it,\" says Mr Rajput.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sonali had always manifested that when we get married, our entire village should witness it. But today, it seems like the whole world is watching it,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That attention, the couple agree, feels good in a way. But the comments, Ms Chouksey adds, are hurting their families. \"For people, it may be just something they watch on social media, but it's our life. And it can destroy someone's family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple have also addressed colourism in several of their interviews.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We live in India where people from different regions have different skin colour. And fair skin doesn't necessarily make someone a good person. So, how can we judge someone on the basis of their skin colour?\" asks Ms Chouksey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput says \"about 70-80% people in India have darker skin tones, but the Indian mentality is that fairer is better. It's time to change that notion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And for those who say the couple are a mismatch, he has a question: \"When you look at us, do we look even remotely unhappy to you? We don't. Because we have what most people don't have. I have her and she has me.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Rabbit shows me passports and documents retrieved from their dead. I asked him if he thinks they have killed a lot of Russians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not enough,\" he replies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rabbit described the situation as \"hard, but under control\".

Nor does Rabbit agree with any suggestion that Ukraine should give up more land for peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says too much blood has already been spilt: \"We are part of this land. If we give it up Russia will want more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another soldier - call sign \"Ghost\" - fighting in another unit in Pokrovsk describes the situation as \"tense, but not critical\". He dismisses reports of its capture as \"Russian propaganda\", saying reports that \"Pokrovsk is surrounded is fake information\", but adds that \"everyone is exhausted – both Russia and Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ukraine, holding ground is also proving costly. The Skala Regiment shares recent videos taken by their troops on the front line - often having to take cover in buildings from Russian drones. The buzz of an approaching drone is often accompanied by heavy automatic fire as they try to bring it down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Khotabych\", who recently spent a month fighting in the city, says it is scary when the drones spot you: \"There are lots and they fly round the clock.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Russians have more drones with thermal imaging cameras, which can see at night. Khotabych said he and his men always hope for \"good weather\" – by which he means fog, rain and grey sky. In other words, anything that makes it more difficult to fly.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Matthew Goddard A man in a Ukrainian uniform with a balaclava and cap\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Matthew Goddard</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Skala Regiment's deputy commander, \"Godfather\", warns that Putin will not stop after Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Pokrovsk, Ukrainian soldiers are focused on the fighting, not peace talks.

the Economic Community of West African States - of which they had all been founding participants 50 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, faced with the prospect that yet another civilian government might be overturned by discontented soldiers, the presidents of the remaining Ecowas member states rapidly reached the conclusion that the attempted coup in Cotonou could not be allowed to succeed.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Learning from past mistakes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having fought off early morning putschist attacks on Talon's home and the presidency offices, loyalist forces had already reaffirmed government control across the city, locking down the main central administrative district. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was proving hard to break down the last-ditch resistance of rebel troops who had shown they were ready to use lethal force without regard for civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, Benin's eastern neighbour and much the largest military power in the region, authorised air strikes, while Ecowas leaders decided to despatch ground troops the same day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those sending forces is Ghana's President John Mahama, who leads a resilient democracy but has made friendly diplomatic overtures to the Sahelian military regimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In acting so quickly, Ecowas has perhaps learned a lesson from its misjudged response to the 2023 coup in Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On that occasion it was not practically organised to intervene militarily in the hours after the elected head of state, Mohamed Bazoum, had been detained by coup leaders – the only moment, perhaps, when a rapid commando raid to rescue him and secure key buildings might have had any chance of success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time the bloc had threatened intervention and begun to plan it, the chance had gone: the new junta had consolidated control over the Nigérien army and mobilised popular opinion in its support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Faced with the prospect of intervention becoming full-scale war, and under strong domestic popular pressure to avoid any such bloodbath, Ecowas leaders backed off - opting to rely on sanctions. And when those also proved counter-productive, they settled for the diplomatic path alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time around, in Benin, the situation was quite different: Talon was still in full control, even if some would-be putschists were still resisting.

At least one civilian – the wife of Talon's key military adviser – was killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgex2d3y3dxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In recent days two top military officials</a> abducted during Sunday's failed coup attempt have been rescued, but security forces are still searching for the coup leader Lt Col Pascal Tigri and other plotters.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Simmering grievances</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was just the latest in a string of coup attempts across the region, though most of the others have succeeded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have all occurred in a context of fragility and pressure in West Africa at a time of Islamist violence across the Sahel, now spreading into the northern regions of many coastal countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is disenchantment with traditional political elites. Even where economies are growing, there is a desperate shortage of jobs and viable livelihoods for the region's rapidly growing young population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, while the regional context is widely shared, the driving factors for the coups are often local - specific to each country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of popular support for the Cotonou putschists stands in stark contrast to the mood on the streets of Conakry, the capital of <b id=\"guinea\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea</b>, in September 2021, when the special forces commander, Col Mamady Doumbouya led the overthrow of then-President Alpha Condé.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Talon, Condé had first been democratically elected but later secured re-election in questionable conditions, and presided over a significant erosion of political freedoms. Yet in Guinea, Condé had presided over violent abuse on a far greater scale than in Benin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition, Condé had then strong-armed his way to a third term aged 83. In contrast the 67-year-old Talon has promised to step down next April, albeit having adjusted the electoral rules to almost guarantee an easy victory for his chosen successor, Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key difference is Condé's deeply disappointing economic track record, whereas Talon has presided over strong growth and improving services.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: People in Benin felt 'total fear' at attempted coup</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Further north, the wave of coups in the Sahelian countries in recent years were also driven by local conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"mali\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Mali </b>and <b id=\"burkina-faso\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Burkina Faso</b>, military commanders had grown frustrated with the weak leadership elected presidents were providing in the campaign against Islamist insurgents. In both countries, troops had repeatedly suffered brutal losses while their <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62052598\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">civilian governments appeared incapable of mobilising the extra weapons or sometimes even food</a> that the troops needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also deep resentment at France's inability to bring the jihadists to heel, despite the high-tech weaponry at the disposal of its forces then deployed across the Sahel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also in Mali, some nationalist sections of political and military opinion were frustrated with the functioning of a 2015 peace agreement with former Tuareg separatists in the far north, overseen by UN troops. Hardliners even accused French forces of actively preventing Bamako from deploying national army units to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"niger\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Niger</b>, the circumstances surrounding the 2023 putsch were equally distinctive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bazoum's political support had been eroded by his very publicly close partnership with France, and particularly his request that Paris provide troops to defend the north-western border from incursions by Mali-based jihadists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, his vocal support for judges probing a corruption scandal in defence procurement also risked alienating powerful elements of the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coup that followed soon afterwards in <b id=\"gabon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Gabon</b>, in August 2023, was similarly the product of local frustrations. In this case the opaque management of election results that saw an implausible victory awarded to President Ali Bongo, in frail health after a slow recovery from a stroke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, circumstances vary widely. And recent events confirm the trend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The region certainly does face a real crisis of security and, in many countries, politics or development too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But national conditions are often the major driver for each upheaval or coup attempt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many suspect the military takeover in <b id=\"guinea-bissau\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea-Bissau</b> aimed to forestall a possible opposition election victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whereas the Benin rebels seem to have been motivated by a mix of army grievances, and broader political and economic complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they strikingly misjudged the popular appetite in Cotonou for any violent or radical system change.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvd01g2kwwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">National Security Strategy published on Friday</a>, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services is common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The phenomenon picked up just before the pandemic in 2020, when north-eastern <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.epw.in/journal/2022/26-27/commentary/revaluing-unpaid-work.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Assam </a>rolled out a scheme for vulnerable women. Since then these transfers have turned into a political juggernaut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent wave of unconditional cash transfers targets adult women, with some states acknowledging their unpaid domestic and care work. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZqvIm1YsEnQNjO8KfzMoNwjH7m9jRfJ/view\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tamil Nadu</a> frames its payments as a \"rights grant\" while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/lbs-wb\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">West Bengal's</a> scheme similarly recognises women's unpaid contributions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other states, the recognition is implicit: policymakers expect women to use the transfers for household and family welfare, say experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This focus on women's economic role has also shaped politics: in 2021, Tamil actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan promised \"salaries for housewives\". (His fledgling party lost.) By 2024, pledges of women-focused cash transfers helped deliver victories to political parties in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the recent elections in Bihar, the political power of cash transfers was on stark display. In the weeks before polling in the country's poorest state, the government transferred 10,000 rupees ($112; £85) to 7.5 million female bank accounts under a livelihood-generation scheme. Women voted in larger numbers than men, decisively shaping the outcome. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics called it blatant vote-buying, but the result was clear: women helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition secure a landslide victory. Many believe this cash infusion was a reminder of how financial support can be used as political leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Bihar is only one piece of a much larger picture. Across India, unconditional cash transfers are reaching tens of millions of women on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maharashtra alone promises benefits for 25 million women; Odisha's scheme reaches 71% of its female voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some policy circles, the schemes are derided as vote-buying freebies. They also put pressure on state finances: 12 states are set to spend around $18bn on such payouts this fiscal year.  A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prsindia.org/files/budget/budget_state_finance_report/2025/SOSF-2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report</a> by  think-tank PRS Legislative Research notes that half of these states face revenue deficits - this happens when a state borrows to pay regular expenses without creating assets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many argue they also reflect a slow recognition of something India's feminists have argued for decades: the economic value of unpaid domestic and care work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women in India spent nearly five hours a day on such work in 2024 - more than 7.6 times the time spent by men, according to the latest Time Use Survey. This lopsided burden helps explain India's stubbornly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS?locations=IN\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">low female labour-force participation.</a> The cash transfers, at least, acknowledge the imbalance, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Do they work?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Evidence is still thin but instructive. A 2025 study in Maharashtra found that 30% of eligible women did not register - sometimes because of documentation problems, sometimes out of a sense of self-sufficiency. But among those who did, nearly all controlled their own bank accounts.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3b25/live/3c1511c0-cf5c-11f0-902b-b378fe598ba1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Swastik Pal Soma Das sells clothes using the money, supporting her seven-member household in West Bengal\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Swastik Pal</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Soma Das sells clothes using the money, supporting her household in West Bengal</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2023 survey in West Bengal found that 90% operated their accounts themselves and 86% decided how to spend the money. Most used it for food, education and medical costs; hardly transformative, but the regularity offered security and a sense of agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More detailed work by Prof Kotiswaran and colleagues shows mixed outcomes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Assam, most women spent the money on essentials; many appreciated the dignity it afforded, but few linked it to recognition of unpaid work, and most would still prefer paid jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tamil Nadu, women getting the money spoke of peace of mind, reduced marital conflict and newfound confidence - a rare social dividend. In Karnataka, beneficiaries reported eating better, gaining more say in household decisions and wanting higher payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet only a sliver understood the scheme as compensation for unpaid care work; messaging had not travelled. Even so, women said the money allowed them to question politicians and manage emergencies. Across studies, the majority of women had full control of the cash.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The evidence shows that the cash transfers are tremendously useful for women to meet their own immediate needs and those of their households. They also restore dignity to women who are otherwise financially dependent on their husbands for every minor expense,\" Prof Kotiswaran says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Importantly, none of the surveys finds evidence that the money discourages women from seeking paid work or entrench gender roles - the two big feminist fears, according to a report by Prof Kotiswaran along with Gale Andrew and Madhusree Jana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor have they reduced women's unpaid workload, the researchers find. They do, however, strengthen financial autonomy and modestly strengthen bargaining power. They are neither panacea nor poison: they are useful but limited tools, operating in a patriarchal society where cash alone cannot undo structural inequities.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Swastik Pal Women at a cash transfer camp in West Bengal\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Swastik Pal</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Women welcome the dignity the cash transfers provide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What next? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emerging research offers clear hints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eligibility rules should be simplified, especially for women doing heavy unpaid care work.

And cash transfers cannot substitute for employment opportunities; many women say what they really want is work that pays and respect that endures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the transfers are coupled with messaging on the recognition of women's unpaid work, they could potentially disrupt the gendered division of labour when paid employment opportunities become available,\" says Prof Kotiswaran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's quiet cash transfers revolution is still in its early chapters. But it already shows that small, regular sums - paid directly to women - can shift power in subtle, significant ways. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether this becomes a path to empowerment or merely a new form of political patronage will depend on what India chooses to build around the money.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,\" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,\" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Whistleblowers, lawsuits and questions</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images (L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC. \n\nThey are all in black suits and seated in a row at a table. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">(L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2875013eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">both been ordered to testify in person</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the wellbeing of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram face-altering beauty filters which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meta maintains the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers</a> who monitor its platforms for misinformation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,\" Zuckerberg said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Public scrutiny and private lobbying</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,\" Mr Scheeler says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And many argued government is overstepping. Parents know best, they say, and they should decide what makes sense for their teens when it comes to social media use. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we've consistently raised concerns about this law… There's a better way: legislation that empowers parents to approve app downloads and verify age allows families - not the government - to decide which apps teens can access,\" a statement from Meta provided to the BBC said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Anika Wells says big tech won't intimidate her over Australian social media ban</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why her government was unsympathetic to this reasoning - why anything short of a ban was unacceptable - Wells said the tech companies have had plenty of time to improve their practices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They have had 15, 20 years in this space to do that of their own volition now, and… it's not enough.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leaders in other countries feel the same, and have been knocking on her door for help, she says, rattling off the EU, Fiji, Greece, even Malta, as examples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark and Norway have already begun work on similar laws, and Singapore and Brazil are watching closely too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're pleased to be the first, we're proud to be the first, and we stand ready to help any other jurisdiction who seeks to do these things,\" Wells said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Too little, too late?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Australia ban loomed, the mounting pressure prompted the companies to introduce versions of their products marketed as safer for young users, said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia, after all, is a major market for social platforms. At parliamentary hearings in October Snapchat said it believed it had about 440,000 account users in the country aged between 13 and 15. TikTok said it had about 200,000 under-16 accounts and Meta said it had about 450,000 between Facebook and Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say they are also eager to ensure they don't lose others in even larger markets around the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images Former Meta engineer Arturo Béjar speaks during a rally from a lectern with a blue sign reading \"protect kids online\".

It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel dismissed it, however.

Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November.

The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel.

Cameras positioned at the entrance track his every move, while reams of barbed wire surround the farm in the rural Free State province in the heart of South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It feels like a prison,\" he says as the gates clank shut behind him. \"If they want to come and kill us they can. At least it will take them time to get to me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fear of being attacked is very real for the white Afrikaner, who manages a farm with his wife and two young daughters. He did not want us to use his full name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His grandfather and his wife's grandfather were both murdered in farm attacks, and he lives a two-hour drive from where the body of 21-year-old farm manager Brendan Horner was discovered five years ago, tied to a pole, with a rope around his neck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marthinus says he can't take a chance with his own family and, in February, they applied for refugee status in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm prepared to do that to get a better life for my wife and children.

Nobody deserves a life like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Violent crime in South Africa is endemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest crime figures released in November for the first quarter of 2025 show there was an average of 63 murders every day. While this was a decrease on the same period in 2024, South Africa's homicide rate remains one of the highest in the world. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Thabo Makopo is also worried about being targeted by criminals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Black farmers are also victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the outskirts of Ficksburg, a town at the foot of Free State's Imperani Mountain, Thabo Makopo has a small farm of 237 acres (96 hectares), where he tends sheep and cattle. Like Marthinus, the 45-year-old says farm attacks are his biggest problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are young men. They are armed and dangerous. Whether they will lose their life or take yours, they are going to take those livestock,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thabo believes all farmers in the province, regardless of their race, are at risk of attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's all of us. I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards. That is more than the police and army combined.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Morgan Barrett rejects the idea that there is a white genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many farmers, like Morgan Barrett, who is white, employ their own security guards, if they can afford it. He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol. Between Morgan and his neighbours, they are out almost every night. Six of his cattle were stolen the previous week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can call the police, and they may turn up two or three hours later, by which time the thieves will have run away,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Thabo, he doesn't believe he is targeted because of the colour of his skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand ($1,200; £880) sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about what he thinks of people claiming there is a \"white genocide\" in South Africa, he says he thinks they \"have no real understanding of what a genocide is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What happened in Rwanda is genocide. What is happening to white farmers is very bad, but I don't think you can call it genocide.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-at-19:00-on-bbc-two-on-monday\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye at 19:00 on BBC Two on Monday</i></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has repeated the widely disputed claims there is a genocide against white farmers, while South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, has accused South African politicians of \"actively promoting\" a genocide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government here has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other white South Africans are being persecuted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country does not release crime figures based on race, but in May, in order to debunk these claims, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu gave a breakdown of killings on farms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mchunu said that between October 2024 and March 2025, there were 18 farm murders across South Africa. Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, faced for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It built on already existing discriminatory legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regime was enforced through violence and repression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing \"race quotas\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05gnyzgd6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A new law this year</a> does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up.

Almost 500 were later found dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police say such cases have doubled since 2012. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population - the second-highest proportion in the world after Monaco, according to the World Bank. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crisis is further compounded by a shrinking workforce and tight limits on foreign workers coming in to provide care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan's government has identified dementia as one of its most urgent policy challenges, with the Health Ministry estimating that dementia-related health and social care costs will reach 14 trillion yen ($90bn; £67bn) by 2030 - up from nine trillion yen in 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its most recent strategy, the government has signalled a stronger pivot toward technology to ease the pressure.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, people are adopting GPS-based systems to keep track of those who go missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some regions offer wearable GPS tags that can alert authorities the moment a person leaves a designated area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some towns, convenience-store workers receive real-time notifications – a kind of community safety net that can locate a missing person within hours.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Robot caregivers and AI</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other technologies aim to detect dementia earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fujitsu and Acer Medical's aiGait uses AI to analyse posture and walking patterns, picking up early signs of dementia – shuffling while walking, slower turns or difficulty standing – generating skeletal outlines clinicians can review during routine check-ups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Early detection of age-related diseases is key,\" says Hidenori Fujiwara, a Fujitsu spokesperson. \"If doctors can use motion-capture data, they can intervene earlier and help people remain active for longer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, researchers at Waseda University are developing AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot designed to be a \"future\" caregiver. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It can help a person put on socks, scramble eggs and fold laundry. The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Lineup of Sharp Poketomo robots at Ceatec in Chiba, Japan\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jaltson-akkanath-chummar\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

This is the light of hope for us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis.

He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans. From here, they continue to countries like Germany, France, and the UK.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Barbara Zanon/Getty Image A man hands out takeaway food to a line of men in coats and hats, outside in a square in Trieste (February 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Barbara Zanon/Getty Image</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most migrants who arrive in Trieste via the Balkan route are male</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After four months of being exploited in Libya, Esther escaped and crossed the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy from which she was rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to the island of Lampedusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She claimed asylum three times before she was granted refugee status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asylum seekers from countries viewed as safe are often rejected. At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"International Rescue Committee 3 women sitting in a room, smiling.

Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.
