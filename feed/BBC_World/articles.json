He, Derick Hall and Rylie Mills only registered 2.5 sacks between them all season but all three got to Maye in the first half.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The Patriots earned only four first downs before the interval and 52 yards in total. Some cruel folks on social media even joked that Bad Bunny gained more yards as he carried a ball during his half-time show.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Hall's second sack forced a fumble which was recovered by Byron Murphy, who also sacked Maye twice as the Dark Side wrote themselves into Seattle folklore alongside the 'Legion of Boom', the defence that led the Seahawks to their previous Super Bowl win in 2014.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me,\" Darnold told NBC.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"Since the first training camp, every single day we came to work. Shout-out to our offensive line for everything they did in the game. But I've also got to shout out our defence.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">\"We did it.
