The case was later turned over to federal prosecutors, who in 2008 made a controversial plea deal with Epstein that included a non-prosecution agreement that protected him from more serious charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement to the BBC, a justice department official said: \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the president contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the White House briefing on Tuesday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked about the reported call and said it \"may or may not have happened in 2006.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"sc-85f9acf9-0 kfxpiP\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The commerce secretary had previously told Congress that he cut ties with Epstein in 2005 after the late financier - a neighbor of Lutnick's in New York - used sexual innuendo to explain why he owned a massage table in a room of his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tuesday's testimony, he said: \"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The justice department files show Lutnick visited Epstein's Caribbean island on 23 December 2012. That came four years after Epstein was convicted for soliciting prostitution from a child. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lutnick's testimony on Capitol Hill marked the first time he publicly confirmed the visit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't recall why we did it, but we did it,\" he said Tuesday, referring to the lunch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lutnick has not been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other time, outside of meeting Epstein on his island, was a year and a half after that when Lutnick said he had an hour-long meeting with Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lutnick noted that within the millions of pages of Epstein documents released by the justice department, roughly 10 emails connect him with Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Over a 14-year period, I did not have any relationship with him, I barely had anything to do with that person,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat from Maryland, grilled Lutnick about the conflicting accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The issue is not that you engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with Jeffrey Epstein, but that you totally misrepresented the extent of your relationship with him, to the congress, to the American people and to the survivors of his despicable criminal and predatory acts,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lutnick is among a series of high profile people named in the more than 3.5 million documents that have been released by the justice department, as mandated by law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The revelation that he had visited Epstein's island long after he asserted that he had cut off contact has led to bipartisan calls for the commerce secretary to resign from the Trump administration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna and Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, who co-sponsored the law that compelled the justice department to release the Epstein files last year, have both urged Lutnick to step down. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khanna and Massie are continuing to pursue further disclosure. After viewing unredacted copies of the files, Khanna revealed the names of six other people on Tuesday that he says were improperly blacked out. Massie said they are \"likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC is contacting the people for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Lutnick was testifying on one side of Capitol Hill, survivors of Epstein abuse gathered on the other to announce Virginia's Law, legislation that aims to remove the time limit for survivors of sexual abuse to file civil claims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The legislation is named for Virginia Giuffre, who was one of the most well-known survivors of Epstein's sexual abuse. She died by suicide in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Giuffre's sister-in-law Amanda Roberts said her wish was to eliminate the statute of limitations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No more laws that treat survivors as though time can erase harm,\" Roberts said, before adding: \"Pass Virginia's Law.\"</p><figure class=\"sc-bc40c3a0-0 kXcvpr\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260126-113039-ddae8f6031-web-2.38.1-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fd9/live/e2646b20-069d-11f1-8d5d-7d6caf00f484.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Howard Lutnick on Capitol Hill\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></figure></div></div></body></html>"

Temperatures are kept between -5 and -4C.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Resurfacing machines, colloquially known as Zambonis, are sent out regularly to shave away ice and form a new smooth layer.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Ice master Mark Messer, who is overseeing the long track speed skating said the hardest part is \"working with a new system for such a high profile event, with little time for preparation\".</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He added that although ice has been made on temporary settings, it has not been done on this scale for an Olympic Games.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Milan-Cortina will be the first time a temporary venue has been used for long track speed skating at a Winters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Darnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">The response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">He answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Was it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">No quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">Luck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.</p><p class=\"ssrcss-1q0x1qg-Paragraph e1jhz7w10\">None have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages. </p></div></div></body></html>"
