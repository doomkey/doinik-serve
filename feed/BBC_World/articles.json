In November 2025, the CRIT, made up of the Mojave, Hopi, Navajo and Chemehuevi tribes, passed the resolution recognising the river as a living, life-giving entity with rights like a person. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Colorado River is currently facing the worst drought in 1,200 years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seven US states that share the river have until 14 February to reach a new water sharing agreement before current ones expires at the end of 2026, or the federal government will step in with their own plan. CRIT believe that personhood status will be a start to help protect the river.</p></div></div></body></html>"
