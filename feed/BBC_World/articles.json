The US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) says it has verified the deaths of 490 protesters and 48 security personnel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another 10,600 people have been detained during the two weeks of unrest, the agency says. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has threatened to strike Iran over the killing of protesters, and President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the US \"stands ready to help\" as Iran \"is looking at FREEDOM\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not elaborate on what the US was considering. He has been briefed on options for military strikes on Iran, an official told the BBC's US news partner CBS. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other approaches could include boosting anti-government sources online, using cyber-weapons against Iran's military, imposing more sanctions, officials told the Wall Street Journal.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's parliament speaker warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests were sparked in the capital, Tehran, by soaring inflation, and are now calling for an end to the clerical rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's attorney general said anyone protesting would be considered an \"enemy of God\" - an offence that carries the death penalty - while Khamenei has dismissed demonstrators as a \"bunch of vandals\" seeking to \"please\" Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Staff at several hospitals have told the BBC <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9rengvnp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">they have been overwhelmed with the injured and dead</a> in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to one hospital in the city of Rasht on Friday night, while a health worker at a Tehran hospital told the BBC: \"Around 38 people died.

Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead &amp; Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians.

including one which showed AI-generated images of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in a bikini.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They just want to suppress free speech,\" Musk wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ashley St Clair, the mother of one of Elon Musk's children, told BBC Newshour on Friday that Grok had generated sexualised photos of her as a child. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conservative influencer said her image had been \"stripped\" to appear \"basically nude, bent over\", despite her telling Grok that she did not consent to the sexualised images.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Clair, who filed a lawsuit against Musk in 2025 seeking sole custody of their child, accused the social media site of \"not taking enough action\" to tackle illegal content, including child sexual abuse imagery. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This could be stopped with a singular message to an engineer,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As of Friday morning, Grok was telling users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\", adding users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An Ofcom spokesperson said on Friday: \"We urgently made contact [with X] on Monday and set a firm deadline of today to explain themselves, to which we have received a response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're now undertaking an expedited assessment as a matter of urgency and will provide further updates shortly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping X raise money or be accessed in the UK - should the firm refuse to comply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Dame Chi Onwurah, chairwoman of the innovation and technology committee, said she was \"concerned and confused\" about how the matter is \"actually being addressed\", and has written to Ofcom and Kendall for clarification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dame Chi said it was \"unclear\" under the Online Safety Act whether the creation of such images using AI was illegal, as was the responsibility of social media sites for what was shared on their platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The act should really make something so harmful to so many people clearly illegal, and X's responsibility should be clear,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Caroline Dinenage, chairwoman of the culture, media and sport committee, likewise said she had a \"real fear that there is a gap in the regulation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are doubts as to whether the Online Safety Act actually has the power to regulate functionality - that means generative AI's ability to nudify someone's image,\" she told BBC Breakfast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The use of Grok to generate non-consensual sexualised images has been condemned by politicians on all sides: </p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called it \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\"</li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said it was \"horrible in every way\" and that X \"needs to go further\" than the changes it had made to Grok on Friday, but he added that banning the platform would be an attack on free speech </li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">The Liberal Democrats called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site was investigated.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he agreed with Starmer that the material was \"completely abhorrent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It, once again, is an example of social media not showing social responsibility,\" Albanese said, adding that Australia's digital safety commissioner was looking at the situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australians and indeed, global citizens deserve better.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Grok was temporarily suspended in Indonesia on Saturday. The country's digital minister said \"non-consensual sexual deepfakes [were] a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the security of citizens in the digital space\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson.

(Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A protest sign in New Brunswick.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog.

(Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches, hallucinations and seizures. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms that can have a psychological root - sometimes described as being an issue with the brain's 'software' rather than any structural damage. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero, and observed her having a seizure at the clinic. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge is still struggling with her condition, but she has received some treatment for FND and is pursuing more. And her diagnosis brought her some peace of mind. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Global News</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport.

Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Today it's better known as the land of the Musang King — a buttery, bittersweet variety that the Chinese have dubbed the \"Hermès of durians\", as prized as the French fashion house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Raub is one of many South East Asian towns that sit at the heart of a global durian rush, pumped by China's growing demand. In 2024, China imported a record $7bn (£5.2bn) worth of durians — a three-fold increase from 2020. This is where more than 90% of the world's durian exports are now headed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if only 2% of Chinese people want to buy durians, that's more than enough business,\" says Chee Seng Wong, factory manager of Fresco Green, a durian exporter in Raub.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wong recalls how farmers cut down durian trees to make room for oil palms, the country's main cash crop, during an economic downturn in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now it's the other way round.

It has been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43940122\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">maligned for gas leaks</a>, and was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46120507\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the reason a plane was grounded</a> after passengers remonstrated against the smell wafting from the cargo hold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans from the region have christened it the \"King of fruits\", but on the internet it has earned a less flattering tag — the world's smelliest fruit — as tourists unused to its odour seek it out with squeamish curiosity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet it has found a growing fanbase in China: as an exotic gift exchanged among the affluent; a status symbol to be unboxed on social media; and the star of culinary heresies from durian chicken hotpot to durian pizza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand and Vietnam are the top durian suppliers to China, accounting for nearly all of its imports. Malaysia's share of the market is sprouting fast, having earned a reputation with premium varieties such as the Musang King.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The average price of durian starts at less than $2 (£1.4) in South East Asia, where they are grown in abundance. But luxe versions like the Musang King could cost anywhere from $14 (£10) to $100 (£74) a pop, depending on their quality and the season's harvest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once I ate Malaysian durian, my first thought was, 'Wow, this is delicious. I have to find a way to bring it to China',\" says Xu Xin, who has been sampling durians at a shop in Raub. The 33-year-old sells the fruit back home in northeastern China, and is on the hunt for the best durians to import.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Koh Ewe Side view of a middle-aged man in a white T-shirt holding a slice of durian in one hand and a yellow glob of durian in the other hand.

BBC Persian has confirmed the identities of 26, including six children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the security forces have also been killed, with one human rights group putting the number at 14. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on Friday night. The morgue there was at full capacity, so the bodies were taken away. The authorities asked the relatives of the dead for 7 billion rials (£5,222; $7,000) to release them for burial, a hospital source said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hospital worker in Tehran described \"very horrible scenes\", saying there were so many wounded that staff did not have time to perform CPR. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around 38 people died. Many as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number was so large that there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After the morgue became full, they stacked them on top of one another in the prayer room,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hospital worker said the dead or wounded were young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Couldn't look at many of them, they were 20-25 years old.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor who contacted the BBC via a Starlink satellite connection on Friday night said Tehran's main eye specialist centre, Farabi Hospital, had gone into crisis mode with emergency services overwhelmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were suspended and staff called in to deal with emergency cases, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's security forces often use shotguns which fire cartridges filled with pellets during confrontations with protesters. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'I saw one person who had been shot in the eye'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another doctor from the city of Kashan in central Iran told the BBC many injured protesters had been hit in the eyes, and that his colleagues in hospitals across the city reported receiving many wounded people during Friday night's unrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday night produced similar accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor at a medical centre in Tehran told the BBC: \"The number of injured people and fatalities was very high. I saw one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around midnight, the centre's doors were closed. A group of people broke the door and threw a man who had been shot inside, then left. But it was too late - he had died before reaching hospital and could not be saved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic at a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday, who said large numbers of injured were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Why are there huge protests going on in Iran?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What footage is emerging from Iran shows protesters in Tehran taking to the streets en masse on Friday night, burning vehicles, and a government building set alight in Karaj, near the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian army has since said it will join security forces in defending public property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It follows reports that Iranian security forces were spread thin as the unrest extended throughout the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities issued a series of co-ordinated warnings to protesters on Friday, with the National Security Council saying \"decisive\" legal action would be taken against \"armed vandals\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian police maintained that no one was killed in Tehran on Friday night, though they said 26 buildings were set on fire, causing extensive damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An eyewitness who joined the protests on Thursday and Friday nights in Tehran told BBC Persian Television that Gen Z Iranians have been instrumental in encouraging their parents and older people to come out and join the protest marches, urging them not to be afraid.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Europe backed Iranians' mass protests and condemned the \"violent repression\" against demonstrators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Friday the international body was very disturbed by the loss of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to \"allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g49djqqjgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">remained defiant in a televised address on Friday</a>, saying: \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In later remarks broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated that his regime \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\" who he said were \"trying to please the president of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the son of Iran's last shah, who was deposed by an Islamic revolution in 1979, described the protests as \"magnificent\" and urged Iranians to continue over the weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,\" Reza Pahlavi said in a social media video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US-based Pahlavi also said he was preparing to return to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former UK ambassador to Iran Sir Simon Gass told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"we really shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves\" when discussing regime change. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the lack of organised opposition within Iran meant people did not have an alternative figure to coalesce around as things stood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he noted the protests were \"a much wider movement\" than previous flare-ups, which were triggered by Iranians finding it \"almost impossible to make ends meet because of the disaster to the economy\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, President Trump reiterated his threat to Iran's leadership that the US would \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He clarified that this did not mean \"boots on the ground\". Last year, the US conducted air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the US state department said accusations by Iran's foreign minister that Washington and Israel were fuelling the protests were a \"delusional attempt to deflect\" attention from the challenges the regime was facing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taghi Rahmani, an Iranian political activist who spent 14 years in prison and whose wife, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, was re-arrested in December, said any lasting change must come from Iranians instead of foreign intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since a 2022 uprising sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained, according to human rights groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-soroush-negahdari,-mallory-moench-and-aleks-phillips\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Soroush Negahdari, Mallory Moench and Aleks Phillips </i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Having grown up in the slums of the capital, Kampala, he dubbed himself the \"ghetto president\" and campaigns on issues such as youth unemployment and human rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 January, Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, after the former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, will compete against Museveni in a presidential election for the second time. But the odds are stacked against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since entering politics, the self-styled revolutionary has been imprisoned and faced several criminal charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His plight has piqued attention around the world - in 2018, musicians including Coldplay's Chris Martin and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn, signed a petition demanding his release from custody. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wine was held on charges relating to the illegal possession of firearms, but the case was widely viewed as being politically motivated.

They say any detentions have been necessary to maintain law and order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has also accused Bobi Wine of holding violent rallies in built-up areas, putting his supporters and the general public at risk - an allegation denied by the opposition leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Museveni took office in 1986, Bobi Wine was just about to turn four.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni and his rebel National Resistance Army (NRA) had seized power in an armed uprising.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine's grandfather, Yozefu Walakira, was part of a different rebel contingent but from time to time during the conflict, he hosted Museveni in his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine spent much of his childhood in Kampala. His mother Margaret Nalunkuuma, a nurse, was the main breadwinner and raised him on the land she bought in the Kamwokya slum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a teenager, Bobi Wine gained a passion for the arts.

One of his earliest hits, Kadingo, was a song about personal hygiene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His music, which features elements of reggae, Afrobeats and traditional Ugandan rhythms, gained a large following, and established him as a champion for social and political change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his mounting fame, Bobi Wine chose to continue recording in a music studio he had built in the Kamwokya slum. He also worked as an actor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2016, many of the country's famous musicians backed President Museveni's re-election. Bobi Wine, however, held out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He released a song named Situka, in which he mused: \"When the going gets tough, the tough must get going, especially when leaders become misleaders and mentors become tormentors.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The following year, Bobi Wine turned his hand to politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He ran in a by-election for the Kyadondo-East constituency as an independent candidate, facing politicians from the ruling NRM and the FDC, which was Uganda's second-biggest party at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He won by a landslide, securing more than five times the total votes of his NRM opponent.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around this time, Bobi Wine developed the People Power movement, a pressure group campaigning for better democratic and social conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members began wearing red berets, which to this day remain a trademark for the opposition leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Bobi Wine was repeatedly blocked from registering People Power as a political party, he joined the lesser-known, already-registered NURP. The party then changed its name to the NUP and Bobi Wine was chosen to be its leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2021, he was ready to challenge Museveni in the presidential election.

of the earliest ceremonies in awards season, the Globes can provide a significant boost of momentum, as a victory or well-received acceptance speech will encourage more Academy voters to check out a particular film.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stars such as <b id=\"sebastian-stan,-demi-moore\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Sebastian Stan, Demi Moore</b> and <b id=\"fernanda-torres\"

strong start thanks to early victories at the Golden Globes, and both went on to win at the Oscars in the animated and international categories respectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

The natural gas industry is pushing more and more production overseas, contributing to higher domestic prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Electricity generation was \"being saddled with ever-increasing costs of fuel\", said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent shifts away from clean energy investments could also be at play. A report from the climate advocacy group Climate Power cites the Trump administration's cancellation of projects that would have produced enough electricity to power the equivalent of 13 million homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gutting of clean energy projects has contributed to a 13% jump in electricity bills since Trump returned to the White House, the report found, as the US increases its dependence on foreign oil.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images An aerial view shows cooling vent fans on the roof next to generators on the lower level of a Digital Realty data centre in Ashburn, Virginia\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Energy-hungry data centres have proliferated in places like Virginia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key factor: energy demand from the artificial intelligence boom is straining the power grid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Technology companies from Alphabet to Amazon are ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, and data centres require massive amounts of electricity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Continued and increasing electricity demand for data centres is pushing up prices for everyone, Quigley said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'You can deal with people's frustrations'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News in November that electricity prices were a \"state problem\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are things that the federal government can control.
