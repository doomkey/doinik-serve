It is not known who is in the Russian delegation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Umerov said his team \"look forward\" to organising Zelensky's US visit \"at the earliest suitable date in November to complete final steps and make a deal\" with US President Donald Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier, a US official travelling with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi briefed reporters that Ukraine had agreed to the peace deal with minor details to be sorted out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked to confirm this, the administration pointed the BBC to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments in Geneva on Sunday, when he said higher-level discussions would still be needed to finalise the agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gap between the terms that Ukraine and Russia will accept is still very wide and the Kremlin is unlikely to agree to the kind of deal that Kyiv may approve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leaders in Kyiv and Europe had criticised the initial draft of a 28-point US peace plan which emerged last week, calling it too favourable to Russia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpd6qd10l94o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Zelensky welcomed the proposed changes</a> to the 28-point plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable,\" he said. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Kremlin official rejected the amendments as \"completely unconstructive\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov – who is not attending the meeting in Abu Dhabi – said on Tuesday that the Kremlin was yet to receive the \"interim\" version of the revised plan, adding that Moscow's view was that it should reflect the \"spirit and letter\" of the Alaska talks between Trump and President Vladimir Putin in August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, a virtual <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"coalition of the willing\"</a> meeting of Ukraine's European allies is taking place on Tuesday to discuss developments, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day, Zelensky said he had a \"good and very productive\" conversation with Starmer, in which they discussed the agenda for the meeting.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

overnight strikes on Monday into Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Zelensky, 22 missiles and more than 460 drones were launched at Ukraine overnight resulting in fires at two high-rise residential buildings in the city centre and the deaths of at least six people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said it had intercepted 249 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Black Sea and Kursk, and that at least three people had been killed in the Rostov region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the weekend talks in Geneva between the US and Ukraine concluded, Trump suggested that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he welcomed the proposed changes, Zelensky said the \"main problem\" was Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory Russia had taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow's forces also control Crimea and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said the final peace plan should make it impossible for Moscow to invade again, and that Russia should \"definitely not\" rejoin the G8.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, she said: \"We can't go back to business as usual... how could you imagine that?\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Probably when you got there, they must have moved back to the headquarters,\" the police commissioner told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He stressed that a search operation for the children was continuing, but said the school was yet to \"report\" to his command. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile Nigeria's police chief Kayode Egbetokun said that he had stepped up operations, including on the intelligence front, to ensure the children and members of staff were freed.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to give everything to ensure that the remaining pupils and their teachers still in captivity are rescued unhurt,\" he said, in a statement issued after talks with the state governor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction at the school was the third to hit Nigeria in a week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state, which borders Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A church was also attacked further south in Kwara state, with two people killed and dozens of worshippers abducted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bola Tinubu cancelled his trip to the G20 summit, held in South Africa at the weekend, to deal with the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He posted on social media on Sunday that all the 38 worshippers abducted in Kwara state had been rescued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: I will not relent. Every Nigerian, in every state, has the right to safety - and under my watch, we will secure this nation and protect our people,\" Tinubu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The spate of abductions has forced the closure of many boarding schools across Nigeria, with parents rushing to collect their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities in Lagos - the most populous state in Nigeria - said they were beefing up security at schools, places of worship and other key buildings to prevent attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-chris-ewokor-and-abayomi-adisa\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Chris Ewokor and Abayomi Adisa</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The attacks took place in Germany and in the Hungarian capital Budapest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The six men and one woman who are on trial face charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and property damage.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have been named only as Henry A, Tobias E, Johann G, Thomas J, Melissa K, Paul M and Julian W, in line with German privacy laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to prosecutors, the attacks, which went on for several years, were prepared for \"intensively\" and included, for example, spying on the targets in advance. In several cases victims were severely injured with blows from a hammer and batons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the seven defendants, Johann G, is charged with having a prominent role in the group. He is accused of having planned the attacks and recruited members. Prosecutors say that another defendant, Paul M, organised combat training for the group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one attack, in January 2019, Johann G, Tobias E and others are alleged to have attacked four people at Germany's Dessau-Rosslau train station who were on their way back from a rally in Magdeburg, marking the anniversary of the World War Two bombing of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defendants are accused of striking the victims on the head with heavy tools, including a hammer and an iron bar.

He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images South Korean actors Baek Il-Sub, Lee Soon-Jae, Shin Gu (Shin Goo) and Park Geun-Hyung attend the press conference for tvN \"Grandpas Over Flowers In Greece\" on March 24, 2015 in Seoul, South Korea.

No arrests have been made. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, said they were \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\".

Volunteers will be paid between €900 (£790) and €1000 (£880) per month, according to La Tribune Dimanche.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conscription in France was scrapped in 1996. The current iteration of the national service, the Service national universel (SNU), only includes two weeks of training followed by another two weeks of community work. It was introduced in 2019 but never gained much traction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Raphaël Glucksmann of the centre-left Place Publique party said he was in favour of the proposal but suggested it should go further and be a universal and compulsory service - \"not necessarily military\" - which could create \"cohesion\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Rally (RN)'s Sébastien Chenu said he supported the idea, although he insisted it should start with a \"mandatory three-month military service for boys and girls\" which could then be extended further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week France's army chief-of-staff Gen Fabien Mandon sparked outrage when he told a congress of mayors that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce91zvnrz0lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">France's biggest weakness was the lack of a will to fight</a> and warned the country risked \"losing its children\" in a potential war with Russia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Macron sounded the alarm over what he called a \"turning point in history\" earlier this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March, against the backdrop of the start of Donald Trump's second term in office and Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine, he gave a sombre address to the nation in which he said that France and Europe needed to be ready if the US was no longer by their side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to be united and determined to protect ourselves,\" Macron said at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, several European countries have brought back some form of military service. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From next year Germany will mandate all 18-year-old men to fill out a questionnaire on their ability to serve, with the view of dramatically boosting troop numbers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Latvia and Sweden also recently restarted military service and Lithuania brought it back after Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.</p></div></div></body></html>"

UN and other aid agencies refused to co-operate with its system, saying it was unethical and unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of Palestinians were killed while seeking food amid chaotic scenes near GHF's sites, mostly by Israeli fire, according to the UN. Israel said its troops fired warning shots.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF said on Monday that it was winding down operations now because of the \"successful completion of its emergency mission\", with a total of three million packages containing the equivalent of more than 187 million meals delivered to Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's executive director, Jon Acree, also said the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) - which has been set up to help implement US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan - would be \"adopting and expanding the model GHF piloted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US state department spokesperson Tommy Piggott wrote on X: \"GHF's model, in which Hamas could no longer loot and profit from stealing aid, played a huge role in getting Hamas to the table and achieving a ceasefire.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas - which denies stealing aid - welcomed the closure of the GHF, Reuters reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Hamas spokesman said GHF should be held accountable for the harm it caused to Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call upon all international human rights organisations to ensure that it does not escape accountability after causing the death and injury of thousands of Gazans and covering up the starvation policy practised by the (Israeli) government,\" Hazem Qassem wrote on his Telegram channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF began operations in Gaza on 26 May, a week after Israel had partially eased a total blockade on aid and commercial deliveries to Gaza that lasted 11 weeks and caused severe shortages of essential supplies. Three months later, a famine was declared in Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's food distribution sites in southern and central Gaza were operated by US private security contractors and located inside Israeli military zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN and its partners said the system contravened the fundamental humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence, and that channelling desperate people into militarised zones was inherently unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN's human rights office said it recorded the killing of at least 859 Palestinians seeking food in the vicinity of GHF sites between 26 May and 31 July. Another 514 people were killed near the routes of UN and other aid convoys, it added. Most of them were killed by the Israeli military, according to the office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said its troops had fired warning shots at people who approached them in a \"threatening\" manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF said there were no shootings at the aid sites and accused the UN of using \"false and misleading\" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The GHF's future had been uncertain since Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire deal to implement the first phase of Trump's peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said aid distribution would take place \"without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner\" with Hamas and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Monday that the GHF's shutdown would have \"no impact\" on its operations \"because we never worked with them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said that while more aid was getting into Gaza since the ceasefire took effect on 10 October, it was \"not enough to meet all the needs\" of the 2.1 million population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

controversial 28-point peace plan for ending the war with Russia.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears Ukraine's European allies produced an amended version of the plan after rejecting parts which favoured Russia's war aims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now the list of necessary steps to end the war can become doable...\" Zelensky said on Telegram. \"Many correct elements have been incorporated into this framework.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, in the early hours of Tuesday, Kyiv's mayor Vitali Klitschko said a wave of Russian missile and drone attacks hit an apartment building in the capital and disrupted electricity and water supplies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

will begin assessing the consequences and restoration work as soon as the security situation permits,\" it said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva on Sunday to discuss the plan, drafted by American and Russian officials in October, which had caused consternation in Kyiv and among its European allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Kremlin official rejected the amendments on Monday as \"completely unconstructive\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another development, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted that the Trump administration was not favouring Russia in its efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The idea that the United States of America is not engaging with both sides equally in this war to bring it to an end is a complete and total fallacy,\" she told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump was \"hopeful and optimistic\" that a plan could be worked out for ending the war, Leavitt added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the end of the talks in Geneva, Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\" but added: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Geneva, the talks began with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio having to deny the 28-point plan advocated by Trump had been written by the Kremlin, as several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p

points, I will discuss with President Trump,\" he added, without saying when.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an official in Zelensky's office, the 28-point plan leaked on Friday no longer existed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the Financial Times, Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsa, who attended the weekend talks in Geneva, said the latest plan consisted of just 19 points, with some of the most politically sensitive elements, including territorial concessions, now due to be decided by the leaders themselves.</p><p

\"main problem\" remained Putin's demand for legal recognition of territory Russia had taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until 27 November to accept the deal or risk losing US support created a sense of urgency across Europe on Friday, and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The counter-proposals - reportedly drafted by the UK, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's permitted army size, and left the door open to Ukraine joining

In just a few months, the two women could be deported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption \"scarred\" her, but she \"wanted a better life for him\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. \"Three weeks later they were approved and on an airplane and here with us,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway, before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now \"feels more complete\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That, at least, is what a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new peer-reviewed study</a> from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Michael Jackson's death</a> but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were striking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

So, if not the Oval Office, what is next for Greene? </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Run for president in 2028</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although she claims she has no interest in the presidency now, having a future change of heart is not an unknown feature of US politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Greene signed a petition to force a vote requiring the release of the files related to Epstein - over Trump's objections - it went on to a bill authored by her Democratic colleague, Ro Khanna. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khanna told NBC News after Greene's latest announcement that she was \"likely to be a formidable 2028 candidate\", adding that she was \"more in touch\" with Trump's base than his number two, Vice-President JD Vance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Time Magazine also reported that Greene \"privately told allies\" she was considering a presidential bid, but Greene quickly dismissed the assertion as a \"complete lie\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not running for President and never said I wanted to and have only laughed about it when anyone would mention it,\" Greene wrote on social media, re-posting Time Magazine's article. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greene has notably distanced herself from her party's positions - and from the president - for whom she once was an ardent supporter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has spoken out against issues including Epstein files, Trump's global tariffs, support for Israel and healthcare funding. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A possible run for governor or Senate </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greene has not been quite as explicit about ruling out the possibility of running for Georgia governor or to represent her state in the US Senate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elections for both take place in 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two-time Republican Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is up against his term limit and unable to run again, widening the field of possible replacements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greene could also use her clout to pursue the race for the US Senate and attempt to unseat Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the role of governor and US senator are ones that Greene has expressed interest in, at least according to Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the president's public spat with Greene following her resignation announcement, Trump wrote on social media that the feud began \"when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn't about to get!)\", he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kennesaw State University Professor of Political Science Kerwin Swint, who lives in Greene's congressional district, says that Trump is aware of her unpopularity outside of her immediate district, and that she would probably \"get obliterated\" if she ran for statewide office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without those options, the only other office she may have her sights on is president, despite her protestations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't see that happening,\" Swint says. \"She would be such an amazing longshot to dark horse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But most politicians have a big enough ego that they look in the mirror, they see a future president. So it's not out of the question.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Entering the conservative media landscape </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swint predicts that she'll start a podcast and attempt to remain in the public spotlight by continuing to build her media profile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think she wants to be an influencer basically. And so I think someone who wants to do that is going to reach for these media opportunities,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If she chooses a life outside of politics, Greene would join a host of former politicians and political operatives who have launched careers in the podcast arena. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Republican Representative Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress to accept his failed nomination to become Trump's US attorney general, he started his own podcast. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend has even caught hold on the left, with Democrats like California Governor Gavin Newsom also hosting his own podcast. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, FBI deputy director Dan Bongino went on to join the Trump administration after success as a radio host and commentator.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greene could also decide to become a conservative commentator on more left-leaning networks, like CNN, where she has made frequent appearances in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I knew she was going to be the next co-host of The View!\", conservative personality Megan McCain wrote on X, referring to Greene's recent appearance on ABC's liberal-leaning daily chat show.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Leave politics behind completely</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 10-minute video announcing her resignation, Greene also suggested she might leave politics to spend more time with her family who she said she missed \"precious time with\" as she fought for Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout her time in politics, Greene said, she faced \"never ending personal attacks\" and \"threats\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been unfair and wrong, not only to me, but especially to my family,\" she said.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since her public feud with the president, Greene said the threats against her have only increased.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition to being a member of Congress, Greene is also the owner of a commercial construction and renovation company called Taylor Commercial. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company has managed roughly $250m in construction projects, since Greene acquired it in 2002, according to her website. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-reporting-by-max-matza\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With reporting by Max Matza</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

So Kyiv had to engage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though -<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Ukraine's deputy foreign minister<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The designation gives it another way to turn up the heat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But questions have been raised as to whether Cartel de los Soles actually exists and Venezuela's foreign

crime expert from Mexico's UNAM university, says the group's activities started in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to developments in neighbouring Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, the powerful Medellín Cartel, based in the Colombian city of the same name, was being dismantled and a major counter-narcotics offensive in the country was bearing fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As established smuggling routes came under pressure, Mr Benítez-Manau argues, the Cartel de los Soles began providing alternative ways to transport cocaine from Colombia. It then strengthened during the early years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez, the left-wing president who led Venezuela from 1999 to his death in 2013, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chávez liked to challenge the United States, and cut all military co-operation ties between the Venezuelan army and the US,\" he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the oversight of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \"some [Venezuelan] army officers felt free to do business with criminals\", Mr Benítez-Manau says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chávez's sympathies with Colombia's left-wing Farc guerrillas - which financed themselves largely through cocaine smuggling - were another factor in re-routing some drug trafficking through Venezuela, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Facing military pressure at home, the guerrilla group moved some operations into Venezuela, safe in the knowledge that the Venezuelan president \"saw them as leftist ideological allies\", Mr Benítez-Manau explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wesley Tabor, a former DEA agent who worked in Venezuela, says the Farc not only found \"a safe haven in Venezuela\" but also many government officials, \"from street-level police to the military aviation\", soon became their partners in drug trafficking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Together, they \"began flooding the US with hundreds of tonnes of cocaine\", he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Former Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal during his extradition hearing to the United States in Madrid, 2019.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Former intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cartel de los Soles, then, differs from other drug networks in that it lacks a formal structure,  says Mr LaSusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not a group per se, he says, but rather \"a system of widespread corruption\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds it has been fuelled by the economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela under President Chávez's successor in office, Nicolás Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Maduro regime cannot offer security forces a decent salary and, to keep their loyalty, it allows them to accept bribes from drug traffickers,\" Mr LaSusa explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mid- and lower-ranking officers who control Venezuela's key entry and exit points, such as airports, make up the Cartel de los Soles, Mr Benítez-Manau says, as they are in prime position to facilitate the flow of drugs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US officials are adamant that the tentacles of the Cartel de los Soles reach to the highest levels of the Maduro government, including the president himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, the US justice department accused Maduro and 14 others of conspiring with armed Colombian groups to ship cocaine to the United States. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the high-ranking officials named were Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino and the former head of Venezuela's Supreme Court, Maikel Moreno. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the indictment, US prosecutors also alleged that since at least 1999, the Cartel de los Soles was led and administered by Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, and former General Clíver Alcalá.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say information provided by former high-ranking Venezuelan military officials -

Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting.

The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu].

He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals.

They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43588465\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries and is recovering from the legacy of a brutal 11-year civil war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">World Health Organization data</a> shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Undercover filming of a man who said he was a juju practitioner and claimed to sell human body parts</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a lecturer at the UK's Arden University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The police raided this house in Waterloo and arrested the occupants, including Idara, who were later charged under anti-witchcraft laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-chris-alcock-and-luis-barrucho\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</i></p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More BBC Africa Eye stories from Sierra Leone:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
