Russia had already annexed Crimea in 2014. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It now occupies most of Luhansk, and is understood to demand Ukraine's withdrawal from all of Donetsk, too, even though Ukraine still controls up to 23% of the eastern region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said the goals of what he calls \"the special military operation\" would be achieved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he preferred to do it through diplomacy, before warning that, \"if the opposing side and their foreign patrons refuse to engage in substantive discussions, Russia will achieve the liberation of its historical lands by military means\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his interview with the BBC Radio 4's PM programme, the Nato secretary general said it was \"insane\" that Putin's pursuit of his \"historical idea that you want to regain access to Ukraine\" - or over the entire territory that used to constitute the former Soviet Union - had caused the death or serious injury to 1.1m of his people.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Rutte praised Trump's efforts to find an end to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US envoys have been conducting intense negotiations with Ukrainian officials over a Trump-proposed peace plan whose initial draft was seen as favouring Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It envisages ceding control of territory in the east of the country to Russia, as well as security guarantees for Kyiv to forestall future Russian aggression.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials say Washington is ready to offer Ukraine guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nato chief told the BBC that \"Russia will see that, with the security guarantees in place, he should never ever try again to attack Ukraine because our reaction will be devastating and that's exactly what we are now discussing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies who met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday in the German capital, Berlin, said a European-led force was also envisaged to \"assist in the regeneration of Ukraine's forces, in securing Ukraine's skies, and in supporting safer seas, including through operating inside Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has opposed any such ideas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also warned that Russia does not seek conflict with Europe, but is ready \"right now\" if Europe wants to - or starts a war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar reassurances were given by Moscow in 2022, just before 200,000 Russian troops crossed the border and invaded Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The war is nearing its fourth anniversary and Kyiv's European allies have been discussing increasing economic pressure on Moscow to stop the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For months, EU leaders have grappled with the idea of using Russian assets frozen days after the start of the invasion to finance Ukraine's military and economic needs.

Another 11 people had so far died after the war-damaged buildings where they were sheltering collapsed, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Mahmoud Bassal, put the death toll higher.

Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote that Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed at least 90 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the recent US actions, Venezuela - home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner.

Researchers aren't sure what happened to the new cub's biological mother, but they are trying to identify her with genetic samples. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bears need all the help they can get these days with climate change,\" Evan Richardson, a polar bear scientist with Environment and Climate Change Canada, said in a video statement. \"If females have the opportunity to pick up another cub and care for it and successfully wean it, it's a good thing for bears in Churchill.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polar bears in the wild only have a 50% chance of surviving into adulthood, but having a mother caring for them improves their odds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cubs appear to be healthy, researchers said, and they will likely stay with their mother until they are about two-and-a-half years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Next, the family is expected to head out to sea ice, where the cubs will learn from their mother how to hunt seals and survive on their own. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's just nice to know that the bears are looking out for each other,\" Richardson said. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Ted Sarandos, Netflix's co-chief executive, called the company's merger agreement \"superior\" and \"in the best interest of stockholders\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter to Warner Bros shareholders, Netflix reiterated its stance that its bid for Warner Bros involves a clearer funding structure and less regulatory risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount could still come back with another offer, meaning the take-over saga gripping Hollywood isn't over yet.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The are considerable differences between the Netflix and Paramount offers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix wants to buy Warner Bros. movie studio and its HBO streaming service, which would also give it access to Warner Bros' rich library of content and secure access to those movies and shows for its subscribers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it doesn't want the media giant's pay-TV channels. If Warner Bros. goes with the Netflix deal it would leave Warner Bros to sell off its television networks, such as CNN and TNT, into a separate company before the takeover is completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount, on the other hand, wants to buy Warner Bros in its entirety, which would mean acquiring competitors to its own TV channels such as CBS, MTV and Showtime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regulators might raise questions about an erosion of consumer choice, as the entertainment industry continues to consolidate ownership.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The week after Netflix announced its deal to acquire Warner Bros, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Paramount Skydance launched a new offer</a> for the whole company, including its television networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A takeover of Warner Bros is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new owner of Warner Bros would gain a significant edge in the highly competitive streaming market. It would get a huge library of films and TV shows, including Harry Potter, the MonsterVerse, Friends and the HBO Max streaming service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the film industry have criticised the plan to merge all or part of Warner Bros with a rival. The Writers Guild of America's East and West branches called for the merger to be blocked, arguing that it would result in lower wages and job cuts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The volume of content for viewers would also be reduced, it said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Nothing, zero, nothing\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the other figures that Wiles commented on was JD Vance, a one-time critic of Trump who has since become a close ally and vice-president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles suggested that Vance's shift in perceptions was \"sort of political\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Vance said he had not read the article, but that he only believes in conspiracy theories that are \"true\" - citing reports of former President Joe Biden's ill-health as an example. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her strongest comments were reserved for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge - before leaving the government in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly thereafter, Musk and Trump had a public spat that saw the two men trade barbs and insults over social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles described Musk as an \"avowed Ketamine [user]\" who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB\", the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" she said. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking back on Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Wiles said that she was against the gutting of the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, saying she was \"initially aghast\" at the idea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she recalled. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"With that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning - hours after the Vanity Fair article was published - Wiles took to X, accusing the magazine of a \"disingenuously framed hit piece\" aimed at her, Trump and other cabinet members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When contacted for comment on the story, the White House also defended Wiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to the BBC, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt added. \"The entire administration is grateful to her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing later in the day, Leavitt accused Vanity Fair of \"bias of omission\" by excluding other interviews conducted with White House staff and taking Wiles' words \"wildly out of context\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk has yet to comment on the Vanity Fair piece. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Our ZEV mandate is already driving jobs, investment and innovation into the UK. As major exporters we cannot compete unless we innovate, and global markets are going electric fast,\" said T&amp;E UK's director Anna Krajinska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the announcement, Sigrid de Vries, director general at ACEA, said that \"flexibility\" for manufacturers was \"urgent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"2030 is around the corner, and market demand is too low to avoid the risk of multi-billion-euro penalties for manufacturers,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take time to build the charging points and introduce fiscal and purchase incentives to get the market on track. Policy makers must provide breathing space to manufacturers to sustain jobs, innovation and investments.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn09pvjpzdjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Carmakers in the UK have previously called for better incentives</a> to encourage drivers to buy electric ahead of the government's planned ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firms across the world have been changing their production lines and investing billions as governments try to persuade people to drive greener cars to meet environmental targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Volvo said it had \"built a complete EV portfolio in less than 10 years\" and was prepared to go fully electric, using hybrids as a transition. It argued if it can move away from petrol and diesel vehicles, other companies should be able to as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The carmaker said: \"Weakening long-term commitments for short-term gain risks undermining Europe's competitiveness for years to come. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A consistent and ambitious policy framework, as well as investments in public infrastructure, is what will deliver real benefits for customers, for the climate, and for Europe's industrial strength.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, German carmaker Volkswagen welcomed the European Commission's draft proposal on new CO₂ targets, calling it \"economically sound overall\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said: \"The fact that small electric vehicles are to receive special support in future is very positive. It is extremely important that the CO₂ targets for 2030 are made more flexible for passenger cars and adjusted for light commercial vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Opening up the market to vehicles with combustion engines while compensating for emissions is pragmatic and in line with market conditions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colin Walker, head of transport at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank, said the UK having \"stable policy\" would give companies the confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid \"jeopardising investments\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was government policy that saw Sunderland chosen to build Nissan's original electric Leaf, and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqlkgynddrdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">today the latest Nissan EV</a> has started rolling off the production lines in the North East, securing jobs for years to come,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Octopus Electric Vehicles chief executive Fiona Howarth warned that if the UK reduced its goals because of changes in Brussels, it would send a \"damaging signal to investors, manufacturers and supply-chain partners\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of these groups have already invested heavily in the transition \"on the assumption the UK would stay the course,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US sanctions targeting Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA have made exporting oil difficult for the Venezuelan government, leading them to resort to a fleet of \"ghost ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what do we know about these vessels and how they operate?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Total and complete blockade'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry as far back as 2019, during his first term as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That year, Venezuelan crude exports fell by more than half from roughly 1.1 million barrels per day in January to about 495,000 by the end of 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six years later, the sanctions remain in place but Venezuela's oil exports have grown again to around 920,000 barrels per day as of November, according to the news agency Reuters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While this falls far short of the country's peak level of oil exports of 3 million barrels per day in 1998, this partial recovery indicates that the sanctions against Venezuela are not working as the US hoped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It indicates that the government of Nicolás Maduro has found new ways to sell Venezuelan oil with the \"ghost fleet\" at their centre.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Not unique to Venezuela</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ghost fleets are a growing phenomenon, used not just by Venezuela but also by two other oil-producing countries under Western sanctions - Russia and Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial intelligence firm S&amp;P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of these, 10% carry only Venezuelan oil, 20% carry Iranian oil, while 50% are exclusively dedicated to Russian oil. The remaining 20% are not tied to any particular country and can transport oil from more than one of these nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oil sanctions aim to discourage countries or companies from buying or dealing with crude oil from sanctioned nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies and nations caught buying oil from sanctioned countries like Venezuela risk being sanctioned themselves by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctioned countries offer their oil at steep discounts so that companies or nations are willing to take the risk of buying it whilst applying tricks to disguise its origin.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">False flags and name changes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the most common strategies ghost tankers use is to frequently change their name or flag - sometimes several times in a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the tanker seized this Wednesday is called The Skipper, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ship has been sanctioned by the US Treasury since 2022 for its alleged role in an oil-smuggling network that helps finance Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At that time, the tanker was named Adisa, but it was originally called Toyo. It was one of the vessels linked to Russian oil tycoon Viktor Artemov, who is also under sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper is a 20-year-old vessel - another common trait among ghost fleet tankers. Major shipping companies usually dispose of ships after 15 years of service, and after 25 years they are typically scrapped.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coast</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Zombie ships'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another trick these ships use is to steal the identity of scrapped vessels by using their unique registration numbers assigned by the International Maritime Organization – similar to criminals using the identity of a dead person.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are known as \"zombie ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last April, a ship called Varada arrived in Malaysian waters after a two-month journey from Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raised suspicions because it was a 32-year-old boat and flew the flag of the Comoros, an island nation off east Africa, which is a popular choice among ships that want to avoid detection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a Bloomberg investigation, it was a zombie ship, as the real Varada had been scrapped in Bangladesh in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news agency compared satellite images with historical photos to detect four zombie ships carrying Venezuelan crude oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other common tactics include disguising the origin of crude oil by transferring it in international waters to legally compliant tankers with other flags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These then deliver the oil to its destination, presenting it as coming from a country that is not sanctioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This happened with Venezuelan oil exports to China during Trump's first term when sanctions were tightened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another common trick among these tankers is disabling the Automatic Identification System, which transmits data including the vessel's name, flag, position, speed or route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This allows ships to hide their identity and location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech says it believes The Skipper was \"spoofing its position for a long time\" - that is, transmitting a false signal, making it appear to be in a different location.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Planet Labs PBC / Reuters Two large oil tankers are connected side by side at sea \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Planet Labs PBC / Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A satellite image taken on 18 November off Venezuelan waters shows The Skipper, on the right, alongside another vessel</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a report in October by the anti-corruption NGO Transparencia Venezuela, there were 71 foreign tankers at the ports of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA - of which 15 are under sanctions and nine are linked to ghost fleets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It found that 24 tankers were operating under stealth, with their mandatory location signals deactivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NGO says it detected six ship-to-ship cargo transfers in waters off western Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the ships flew flags of countries considered regulatory havens with lax oversight of sanctions, including Panama, Comoros and Malta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many spent more than 20 days without docking at an oil terminal, unlike the Chevron-operated ships that the US has authorised in Venezuela, which load and leave within six days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The extended stay in port areas without directly reaching oil terminals raises serious doubts about the type of operations these vessels are conducting,\" said Transparencia Venezuela in its report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that the operation to seize the ship on 10 December came from the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier -
