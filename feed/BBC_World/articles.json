Last week, Canada's Prime Minister Carney <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announced a \"strategic partnership\"</a> with China, and agreed to reduce tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, Trump called the move \"a good thing\". But tensions between the US and Canada have grown in recent days, after Carney said in a speech in Davos that the US-led world order had been ruptured.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney also urged other \"middle powers\" to band together in the face of economic coercion by \"greater powers\", though he did not mention Trump by name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump responded to the remarks in his own speech the next day, saying: \"Canada lives because of the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president also <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7jjp8gl0jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">withdrew an invitation for Canada</a> to join his new Board of Peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Trump said in his social media post that if Carney \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the White House and Carney's office for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's US trade minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a statement: \"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">LeBlanc said the government was focused on building a stronger Canadian economy and strengthening trade partnerships \"throughout the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada has been seeking to diversify trade away from the US, its largest trade partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the agreement reached between Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping last week, China will lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will  tax Chinese EVs at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal was seen as a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat tariffs, and could see more Chinese investments in Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney said the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

We have never really asked anything of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan... and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That triggered a huge backlash from the families of soldiers who served in Afghanistan, as well as veterans and politicians from across the Westminster and international spectrum who called for Trump to apologise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prince Harry said the sacrifices of troops needed to be respected as he pointed out Nato's collective security clause had been invoked once - following the 9/11 attacks.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October 2001 the US invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban, whom they said were harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks the previous month. Nato nations contributed troops and military equipment to the US-led war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 3,500 coalition soldiers died, about two-thirds of them Americans, as of 2021 when the US withdrew from the country. The UK suffered the second-highest number of military deaths in the conflict behind the US, which suffered 2,461 fatalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Downing Street said the prime minister and US president spoke about the UK's involvement alongside US and Nato forces in the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson said: \"The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home.

Relations with China will now be approached through \"strength, not confrontation\", the report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defence strategy reinforces recent calls from President Donald Trump, including for greater \"burden-sharing\" from allies in countering threats posed by Russia and North Korea.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new 34-page report follows last year's publication of the US National Security Strategy, which said Europe faced civilisational collapse and did not cast Russia as a threat to the US. At the time, Moscow said the document was \"largely consistent\" with its vision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, in 2018, the Pentagon described \"revisionist powers\", such as China and Russia, as the \"central challenge\" to US security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new strategy calls on American allies to step up, saying partners have been \"content\" to let Washington subsidise their defence, although it denies the shift signals a US move towards \"isolationism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To the contrary, it means a focused and genuinely strategic approach to the threats our nation faces,\" it says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has long neglected the \"concrete interests\" of Americans, the report says, adding the US does not want to conflate American interests \"with those of the rest of the world – that a threat to a person halfway around the world is the same as to an American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, it says allies, especially Europe, \"will take the lead against threats that are less severe for us but more so for them\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, is described as a \"persistent but manageable threat to NATO's eastern members\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike in previous versions of the strategy, Taiwan, the self-governing island claimed by China, is not mentioned. However, the document does write that the US aims to \"prevent anyone, including China, from being able to dominate us or our allies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year, the US announced a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87l7xjp235o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">vast arms sale to Taiwan</a> worth $11bn (£8.2bn), leading China to hold military drills around the island in response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy also outlines a \"more limited\" role for US deterrence of North Korea. South Korea is \"capable of taking primary responsibility\" for the task, it adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 12 months since Trump began his second term as president, the US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdred61epg4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro</a>, carried out strikes against <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged drug boats</a> in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean, and more recently, applied pressure on US allies to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86vvjxe9z7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">acquire Greenland</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy reiterates that the Pentagon \"will guarantee US military and commercial access to key terrain, especially the Panama Canal, Gulf of America, and Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The document says the Trump administration's approach will be \"fundamentally different from the grandiose strategies of the past post–Cold War administrations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It adds: \"Out with utopian idealism; in with hardnosed realism.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the World Economic Forum earlier this week, Trump claimed the US had \"never gotten anything\" from Nato and \"we've never asked for anything\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He further criticised the organisation, incorrectly claiming \"the United States was paying for virtually 100% of Nato\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old world order is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"not coming back\"</a> and urged fellow middle powers - like South Korea, Canada and Australia - to come together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Middle powers must act together because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu,\" Carney said at the Davos meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That came as French President Emmanuel Macron also warned of a \"shift towards a world without rules\". </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

According to Rutte's post on X, they agreed \"to enhance deterrence and defence in the Arctic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After landing at Nuuk airport, Frederiksen was greeted on the tarmac by Nielsen, who gave her a hug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am first and foremost in Greenland today to show our strong Danish support for the Greenlandic people,\" she told reporters. \"It's a very difficult time, everyone can see that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a serious situation we are in.

There's no end, there's no time limit.\" Notably, Trump did not mention American ownership of Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For former Danish foreign minister, Martin Lidegaard, that's a sign of positivity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hear a change in the language from the President,\" he told the BBC \"He does not necessarily think he has to own [Greenland].\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a bit more optimistic than I have been for quite a long time, where we saw only escalation after escalation after escalation,\" says Lidegaard, who's also known for inspiring <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-61591675\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the latest series of Borgen</a>, a Danish political drama, which features a plotline about a power struggle over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite Trump's climbdown, Greenlandic MP Aaja Chemnitz told the BBC it will take much more to rebuild trust among her compatriots. \"I think it's too early to lower our shoulder… Many people are confused and concerned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier Trump had also told CNBC that an \"ultimate long-term deal\" over Greenland \"pertains to security and minerals, and everything else\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chemnitz is sceptical. \"Minerals haven't been discussed with Nato. Why should they do that? This is completely up to Greenland,\" she said, which has legal authority over its own land and resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Likewise, Per Stig Moeller, another former Danish Foreign Minister, remains cautious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the situation is \"still very delicate\" and \"might change tomorrow\", pointing to recent meetings in Washington, and the White House's diverging interpretation of what had been agreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why it's very important that we insist, it all happens inside NATO,\" he suggests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously the New York Times reported that one idea under discussion was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/21/us/politics/trump-greenland-threats-diplomacy-force.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Denmark ceding sovereignty over small pockets of land</a> where the US would build military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Danish and Greenlandic officials have pushed back strongly against giving up any sovereignty, making clear that it is a \"red line\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Frederiksen has said it was non-negotiable, although Denmark was willing to work on \"security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued that taking control over Greenland is necessary for the security of the United States, pointing to a growing presence of China and Russia in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response Denmark and its European allies have sought to reassure the US that they'll boost Arctic security, while calling for a more substantive Nato presence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d13e/live/5225c3a0-f889-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Danish PM Mette Frederiksen, in the centre of the picture wearing a light-brown puffer jacket, walks with the Greenland prime minister and a large crowd towards the camera on an ice-covered street in Nuuk with houses and a church in the background.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Frederiksen (centre-left in light-brown) has described Greenland's sovereignty as a \"red line\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has around 150 military personnel at its single Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a defence pact with Denmark, dating back to 1951, the US can already build up its military presence and deploy further troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They withdrew bases.

The Albertans are very independent people.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/trump-cabinet-member-weighs-in-on-alberta-separatism-9.7058082\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly3d28p4p8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos</a> calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymd0d8zvyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">responded in his own speech with</a>: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services.

They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are shark attacks increasing overall?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The school normally has about 300 students.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regional authorities accuse the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - the paramilitary group at war with the Sudanese army - of firing the shells. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RSF has never commented on the incident and did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. It is not clear whether the shelling of the school was intentional.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Makarem says half of her friends at school were killed while the other half were injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as injuring her shoulder, she also suffered a head wound, but was discharged from hospital having received basic treatment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But several days later, after developing severe headaches, she was given a CT scan which found a small piece of shrapnel in her head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It hurt very much and I had to take many painkillers,\" she says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan's civil war began in April 2023 and has resulted in the deaths of more than 150,000 people, with millions forced from their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The United Nations says the country is now enduring the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan's oil-rich Kordofan region - which is divided into North, South and West Kordofan states - has become a major front line in the war due to its strategic significance, sitting between RSF-controlled areas in the west and eastern areas where the army is mostly in charge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say whoever controls the region effectively controls the country's oil supply, as well as a large chunk of the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An estimated 13 million of the 17 million school-age children who have remained in Sudan are out of school, according to the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Darfur, under RSF control, is the worst affected state, according to the charity Save the Children, with just 3% of its schools open.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Abu Sitta school was closed for three months after the attack while it was renovated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Makarem and Ikram said initially they could not imagine returning to the place where their friends and teacher had been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But when I saw my friends returning and telling me that things were OK, I decided to return,\" says Ikram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even so, returning to school brought back painful memories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I used to close my eyes on the way to class to avoid looking at the area where the shelling happened,\" Ikram says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of students were given psychological support at the school when they returned, says headteacher Iman Ahmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beds and nurses were also made available at the school to allow injured students to take their exams in comfort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although el-Obeid is still being subjected to repeated drone attacks, students at the school were playing and laughing in the courtyard when the BBC visited in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The headteacher describes the girls' determination to continue their studies, despite what happened to them, \"as a form of defiance and loyalty to those who were lost\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ikram says she used to close her eyes on the way to class to avoid looking at the area where the shelling happened </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the situation for children trying to learn in el-Obeid remains challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city lived under a siege by the RSF for more than a year and a half, until the Sudanese army regained control in February 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there is now relative calm, dozens of schools have been converted into shelters for people fleeing the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">El-Obeid hosts nearly one million displaced people across various shelters, according to the state's humanitarian aid commissioner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ibtisam Ali, a student at a secondary school that has been converted, says she cannot leave her classroom until the end of the school day because the grounds are full of displaced people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even going to the bathroom has become a problem for us,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walid Mohamed Al-Hassan, the minister of education in North Kordofan state, said the presence of displaced families in schools had caused problems -

It was very difficult.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Tarek Zobier, a neurologist in Sudan, said the medical implications of having shrapnel lodged in the head vary from case to case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some people will experience no symptoms and can live without medical intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if more severe symptoms, such as spasms, are experienced, surgery may be required.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Makarem, the pain is no longer consistent, although it gets worse in winter when it's cold. She relies on painkillers when needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She's decided to repeat her school year so she can retake her exams.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe that I will be able to achieve the score I am aiming for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am hopeful for the future,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-salma-khattab\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Salma Khattab</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"to-support-children-in-sudan-and-other-arabic-speaking-countries-who-are-denied-or-restricted-from-accessing-education,-the-bbc-world-service-is-launching-a-new-season-of-the-arabic-edition-of-its-award-winning-educational-programme-dars---or-lesson.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"to-support-children-in-sudan-and-other-arabic-speaking-countries-who-are-denied-or-restricted-from-accessing-education,-the-bbc-world-service-is-launching-a-new-season-of-the-arabic-edition-of-its-award-winning-educational-programme-dars---or-lesson.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">To support children in Sudan and other Arabic-speaking countries who are denied or restricted from accessing education, the BBC World Service is launching a new season of the Arabic edition of its award-winning educational programme Dars - or Lesson.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"the-first-episode-will-air-on-saturday-24-january,-on-bbc-news-arabic-tv.-new-episodes-are-broadcast-weekly-on-saturdays-at-09:30-gmt-(11:30-eet),-with-repeats-on-sundays-at-05:30-gmt-(07:30-eet)-and-throughout-the-week.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"the-first-episode-will-air-on-saturday-24-january,-on-bbc-news-arabic-tv.-new-episodes-are-broadcast-weekly-on-saturdays-at-09:30-gmt-(11:30-eet),-with-repeats-on-sundays-at-05:30-gmt-(07:30-eet)-and-throughout-the-week.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">The first episode will air on Saturday 24 January, on BBC News Arabic TV.

but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after Arctic security <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60837944\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was thrust into the headlines </a>following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that additional defences in the region are urgently needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such a threat is no longer theoretical. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cyvmj6mem70o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"
