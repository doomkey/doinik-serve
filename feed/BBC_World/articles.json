But he did not give a time frame. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protests continued in Minneapolis and other US cities on Sunday, as Minnesota Governor Tim Walz warned that America was at an \"inflection point\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The facts around the incident - the second fatal shooting by agents of a US citizen in recent weeks - have been hotly contested, setting up  a fresh confrontation between state and federal officials. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has defended the officer who shot Pretti. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local authorities deny this, adding that the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump was directly asked twice whether the agent had done the right thing. He responded: \"We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also told the newspaper: \"I don't like any shooting. I don't like it.\" He added: \"But I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest and he's got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn't play good either.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration is facing pressure from some prominent Republicans, who have joined opposition Democrats in calling for a wide-ranging investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Bill Cassidy said the probe should involve both federal and state officials. Congressman James Comer, an ally of Trump, suggested that the president should consider withdrawing immigration agents from Minneapolis and sending them elsewhere, telling Fox News that the city's mayor and state governor were putting them in harm's way, and \"there's a chance of losing more innocent lives\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his comments to the Wall Street Journal, Trump said of the deployment: \"At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple vigils were held for Pretti in Minneapolis over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lifelong resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those who gathered on Sunday afternoon to pay her respects and protest against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm tired of protesting,\" she told the BBC. \"We can't comprehend how this is happening. Why are we letting this happen?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demonstrators of all ages were chanting \"No more Minnesota nice - Minneapolis on strike\" and \"ICE out now\" before they began moving through the city streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not the America I fought for,\" said one man the BBC spoke to, who asked not to be named. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protests have spread to other US cities, including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief executives of more than 60 Minnesota-based businesses, including 3M, Best Buy and Target have also signed an open letter calling for \"an immediate de-escalation of tensions\" and for local and federal officials \"to work together to find real solutions\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara told the BBC that state officers were blocked from accessing the scene of Pretti's shooting by federal agents, despite securing a  search warrant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that all levels of law enforcement in Minnesota have been working with federal law enforcement \"for several years\", and that the unfolding situation in Minnesota was hampering agencies' ability to continue such investigations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawmakers continue to be divided over the shooting of Pretti, as well as his second Amendment right to bear arms. It is legal in Minnesota to carry a handgun in public if you have a permit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety effort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. It has also described Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti's family issued a statement in response to the comment, saying: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They added that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62r4g590wqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets</a>. According to Associated Press (AP), court records show he had no criminal record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,\" his family said in the statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Tim Walz said: \"I don't care if you are conservative and you are flying a Donald Trump flag, you're a libertarian, don't tread on me, you're a Democratic Socialist of America. This is an inflection point, America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we cannot all agree that the smearing of an American citizen and besmirching everything they stood for and asking us not to believe what we saw, I don't know what else to tell you.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch:

eZyhnA\">Backlash against the Trump administration's crackdown is growing, including from within the Republican party. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt told CNN that people were watching fellow Americans being shot on television and that \"federal tactics and accountability\" had become a growing concern for voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy said the Minneapolis shooting was \"incredibly disturbing\" and \"the credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats have responded by threatening to block a key government financing package if it contains funds for the Department of Homeland Security, of which ICE is a part, raising the prospect of another government shutdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have both criticised the situation in Minneapolis, with the former described events in Minneapolis as \"horrible scenes\" that \"I never thought would take place in America.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg50vv1ezko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations</a>, but several polls suggest about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other polls indicate voters <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg50vv1ezko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants</a>.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile on Sunday evening Trump demanded in a post on Truth Social that Walz and Frey, as well as \"EVERY Democrat Governor and Mayor in the United States\" must \"formally cooperate with the Trump Administration to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also called on US Congress to end sanctuary cities, which he alleged were the cause of \"all these problems\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The term 'sanctuary city' is commonly used to describe places in the US that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's posts followed remarks from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, where she condemned Walz as wanting chaos, and encouraging \"left-wing agitators to stalk and record federal officers in the middle of lawful operations\".</p></div><figure><div

agents and Pretti just before the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told the BBC that Pretti was a lawful gun owner with no criminal record other than traffic violations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Rifle Association (NRA) - which is typically aligned with Trump - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvg812n01no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">has joined other US gun lobby groups in calling for a \"full investigation\" into the killing of Pretti.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, it said: \"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino said earlier that at the time of the shooting, ICE agents were looking for a man named Jose Huerta Chuma during a \"targeted\" operation, and that Chuma's criminal history includes domestic assault, intentional infliction of bodily harm and disorderly conduct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minnesota Department of Corrections (DOC) has since rebutted those claims and said that Huerta had never been in Minnesota DOC custody and public records reflected only misdemeanour-level traffic offences from

A crackdown on illegal immigration was central to his successful re-election campaign and is backed by many around the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has characterised the Minneapolis operation as a public safety efffort aimed at deporting criminals illegally in the US. Critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-says-administration-is-reviewing-everything-about-minneapolis-shooting-a501f48e?mod=WSJ_home_mediumtopper_pos_1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in an interview with the Wall Street Journal</a>, Trump praised the agents' work but suggested the operation would eventually end, although he did not specify when.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At some point we will leave,\" Trump said. \"They've done a phenomenal job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state's Governor Tim Walz has urged the president to remove the agents immediately. \"We believe that Trump needs to pull his 3,000 untrained agents out of Minnesota before they kill another American in the street,\" he said on Sunday. Other state and local officials have echoed Walz's view.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Unpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the course of the weekend, multiple vigils were held in the city as residents sought to remember and celebrate Pretti's life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the site where he was killed in south Minneapolis, close to the Calvary Baptist Church, mourners gathered at all hours to lay flowers and light candles in his honour. One sign, drawn with red paint and directed at federal agents, read \"stop killing us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lifelong Minneapolis resident Pege Miller, 69, was among those gathered on Sunday afternoon to protest against ICE and pay her respects to Pretti.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm tired of protesting,\" she said. \"We can't comprehend how this is happening.

Many there expressed anger and sadness about the immigration operation. Protesters repeatedly chanted: \"No more Minnesota nice, Minneapolis will strike.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those chanting was Felix Johnson, who said he protested for the first time in his life a few weeks ago when he saw a video which appeared to show a four-year-old girl who was left in a car after her father was detained by ICE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He held a sign that read \"ICE out\", while dozens of other posters in the crowd included profanities directed at immigration officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't understand how they can come in and just start snatching people that are citizens and start treating them like they're animals,\" Johnson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few Minnesotans the BBC spoke to said they supported ICE operations, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/23/us/politics/poll-ice-immigration.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">several polls suggest</a> about half of voters nationwide support President Trump's efforts to deport those living in the US illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other polls indicate voters are split on how Trump is carrying out that crackdown on undocumented immigrants. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/24/poll-republicans-ice-immigration-deportations-00744668\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">One conducted by Politico</a> shortly after Renee Good's death this month suggested about half of Americans felt the mass deportation campaign was too aggressive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the protest in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday, one man held a sign that read \"Veterans Against ICE\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I joined [the military] to serve a country that, while never perfect, was a country that was improving, that was growing,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I joined to support the tenets of freedom of this country and what we're seeing here, this is the opposite, this is not promoting freedom.

A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He felt he had two options: \"Go to the police and say, 'I'm in the Interpol system,'\" and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean \"you can't rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked\", which is what happened to him, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's constant nerves, all the time,\" he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country.  The police can \"break into your house at any time… that's why you're like a cornered rat\", he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you,\" that breaks families apart, he adds.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says it wasn't just that he was against \"having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to\" but that \"it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency's checks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol's internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), arguing that Russia's request was politically motivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol's constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used \"to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images A firefighter is standing on a ladder next to a light grey multi-storey building which has white smoke pouring out of it.

He showed us CCF documents that said the information Russia had provided was \"generic and formulaic\" and there had been an \"inadequate explanation\" of the alleged crime. Interpol cancelled the request for Pestrikov's detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interpol only releases very basic data about illegitimate requests for arrests and since 2018 has not revealed which countries are the subject of complaints and inquiries. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the scale of the problem, but for the first time, the leaked documents reveal a much fuller picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One batch of files shared with the BBC contains a list of complaints sent to the CCF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The data is not complete, but it covers a broad range of countries, and where the nation requesting an arrest is listed, there are more complaints about Russia than anywhere else - this has been the case for the past 11 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files also show that in the past decade, at least 700 people who were wanted by Russia complained to the CCF, and at least 400 of them had their red notices or diffusions overturned - that is more than for any other country, according to the data we received.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The files show Russia attempted to use Interpol's messaging system to get information about journalist Armen Aramyan after he left the country</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Historically it has been Russia who is one of the main perpetrators of abusive red notices,\" says British barrister Ben Keith, who has represented many clients wishing to have their names removed from Interpol's wanted lists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He thinks Interpol has a particular problem with Russia and that the agency's attempts to prevent abuse have not been successful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says that he has \"a steady flow of clients who are subject to Russian red notices who are either politically connected, or often pro-Ukraine, or alternatively as a result of corporate raiding\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International lawyer Yuriy Nemets, who specialises in Interpol matters and extradition, agrees that Interpol's extra scrutiny of Russia's requests for arrests, introduced after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has not proved effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is aware of a number of cases in which Russians opposed to the war \"have been targeted for speaking out against what's going on and were charged with financial… or other ordinary crimes and put into the database based on that\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not hard to game the system,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as information on notices and complaints, the Interpol insider also provided the BBC with thousands of messages sent between individual countries via Interpol's messaging system, revealing another, less formal route to trace people abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One message from Moscow to law enforcement agents in Abu Dhabi explained how Interpol had denied a request for a red notice, but that it still wanted help in tracing the subject's whereabouts.

And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even while concerns about Russia's misuse of Interpol's systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This seems to have been settled in Moscow's favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its \"strict rules on the processing of data\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was \"concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol's systems\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Russia's ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. \"If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time,\" says Keith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, \"with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting: Andreea Jitaru and Ned Davies</b></i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

On Saturday he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qww3w72lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canada</a> if it strikes a trade deal with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gold and other precious metals are seen as so-called safe-haven assets that investors buy in times of uncertainty. On Friday, silver topped $100 an ounce for the first time, building on its almost 150% rise last year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demand for precious metals has also been driven by a range of other factors including higher-than-usual inflation, the weak US dollar, buying by central banks around the world and as the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates again this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wars in Ukraine and Gaza, as well as Washington seizing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, have also helped push up the price of gold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the biggest appeals of gold is its relative scarcity. Only around 216,265 tonnes of the metal have ever been mined, according to the World Gold Council trade association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's enough to fill between three to four Olympic-sized swimming pools. The majority of that was only extracted from the earth since 1950, as mining technology advanced and new deposits were discovered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Geological Survey estimates that another 64,000 tonnes of gold can still be mined from underground reserves, although the supply of the metal is predicted to plateau in the coming years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,\" said Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world,\" he added.</p></div><p

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gold saw a blockbuster year in 2025, with its biggest annual gain since 1979 as investors flocked to precious metals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With financial markets spooked by concerns including Trump's tariffs and fears that artificial intelligence-related stocks are overpriced, gold repeatedly hit new record highs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Susannah Streeter, chief investment strategist at Wealth Club, an investment platform for the wealthy, said gold \"seems to know no bounds\" amid ongoing political uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The pile on into the gilded safe haven is continuing with the precious metal racing up higher,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Streeter pointed to trade tension sparked by Trump's tariff threat against Canada, saying it had \"unnerved investors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While economic concerns can help to push up the price of gold, it also tends to rise when investors expect interest rates to be cut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lower rates typically mean smaller returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to assets like gold and silver.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its main interest rate twice this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's inversely correlated because the opportunity cost of keeping the money in a [government bond] is really not worth it anymore, so people go to gold,\" said Ahmad Assiri, Research

He covered war, famine, riots and assassinations, the Bhopal gas tragedy and the Indian army's storming of the Sikh Golden Temple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the small north Indian city of Ayodhya in 1992, he faced a moment of real peril. He witnessed a huge crowd of Hindu hardliners tear down an ancient mosque. Some of the mob - suspicious of the BBC - threatened him, chanting \"Death to Mark Tully\". He was locked in a room for several hours before a local official and a Hindu priest came to his aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition provoked the worst religious violence in India for many decades - it was, he said years later, the \"gravest setback\" to secularism since the country's independence from Britain in 1947.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are sad to hear the passing of Sir Mark Tully,\" Jonathan Munro, Interim CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, said in a statement. \"As one of the pioneers of foreign correspondents, Sir Mark opened India to the world through his reporting, bringing the vibrancy and diversity of the country to audiences in the UK and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"His public service commitments and dedication to journalism saw him work as a bureau chief in Delhi, and report for outlets across the BBC. Widely respected in both India and the UK, he was a joy to speak with and will be greatly missed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was where Sir Mark was born - in what was then Calcutta (now Kolkata) in 1935. He was a child of the British Raj. His father was a businessman. His mother had been born in Bengal - her family had worked in India as traders and administrators for generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was brought up with an English nanny who once chided him for learning to count by copying the family's driver: \"that's the servants' language, not yours\", he was told. He eventually became fluent in Hindi, a rare achievement in Delhi's foreign press corps and one which endeared him to many Indians for whom he was always \"Tully sahib\". His good cheer and evident affection for India won him the friendship and trust of many of the top rank of the country's politicians, editors and social activists.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark, seen here with members of India's armed forces, arrived in India as an administrative assistant at the BBC in 1965</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout his life, he performed a balancing act: English, without doubt; but not - he insisted - an expat who was passing through India. He had roots there; it was his home. It's where he lived for three-quarters of his life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Immediately after World War Two, at the age of nine, Sir Mark came to Britain for his education. He studied history and theology at Cambridge and then headed to theological college with the aim of being ordained as a clergyman before he - and the church - had second thoughts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sent to India for the BBC in 1965 - at first as an administrative assistant, but in time he began to take on a reporting role. His broadcasting style was idiosyncratic, but his strength of character and his insight into India shone through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some critics said he was too indulgent of India's poverty and caste-based inequality; others admired his clearly expressed commitment to the religious tolerance upon which independent India was anchored. It's \"really important to treasure the secular culture of this country, allowing every religion to flourish,\" he told an Indian newspaper in 2016. \"... we must not endanger this by insisting on Hindu majoritarianism\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7db5/live/0cc624c0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Bureau Chief of BBC in India Sir Mark Tully recording a despatch from the historic Jama Masjid in Delhi, May 10, 1994.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark's was a familiar voice for BBC listeners in the UK and around the world</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Mark was never an armchair correspondent. He travelled relentlessly across India and neighbouring countries, by train when he could. He gave voice to the hopes and fears, trials and tribulations, of ordinary Indians as well as the country's elite. He was as comfortable wearing an Indian kurta as in a shirt and tie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was expelled from India at 24 hours' notice in 1975 after the then prime minister, Indira Gandhi, ordered a state of emergency. But he headed back 18 months later and had been based in Delhi ever since. He spent more than 20 years as the BBC's head of bureau in Delhi, leading the reporting not simply of India but of South Asia, including the birth of Bangladesh, periods of military rule in Pakistan, the Tamil Tigers' rebellion in Sri Lanka and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over time, he became increasingly out of step with the BBC's corporate priorities, and in 1993 he made a much-publicised speech accusing the then director general, John Birt, of running the corporation by \"fear\". It marked a parting of the ways. Sir Mark resigned from the BBC the following year. But he continued to broadcast on BBC airwaves notably as presenter of Radio 4's Something Understood, turning back to issues of faith and spirituality which had engaged him as a student.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0f34/live/6c4614a0-ffcf-11ef-8485-93fd34b35f50.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Sir William Mark Tully in Delhi\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sir Mark stayed on in Delhi after he left the BBC</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unusually for a foreign national, Sir Mark was accorded two of India's top civilian honours: the Padma Shri and the Padma Bhushan.

The principal advice, in this context, is from MI5.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The argument the government is best informed seemed somewhat at odds with the fact the MI5 officer whose sworn statement was provided to support the case had not read the relevant underlying material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the chief constable of Northern Ireland to be at loggerheads with MI5 is \"unprecedented\" says veteran investigative journalist, John Ware, who has reported on the Troubles since the 1970s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If anybody had told me even 10 years ago that there would come a time when the chief constable of the PSNI and the Security Service were at loggerheads, I would have fallen off my stool,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trust, state secrecy and the public</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boutcher has a raised a stark question: can the authorities who played a role in the events, including MI5, be trusted to decide whether to tell the public about what happened, when doing so could leave them exposed?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also indirectly raised this question about the legal system itself - due to its own role in the Stakeknife case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Scappaticci helped create a legal precedent on state secrecy that is routinely cited by the government to this day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2003, he sought a judicial review over the then government's refusal to publicly deny media reports that he was Stakeknife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Scappaticci was bluffing and did not actually want to succeed, since if the government was ordered to tell the truth, he would have been confirmed as Stakeknife.

He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Canadian PM, Mark Carney, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, stands at a microphone in front of a blue backdrop bearing the words World Economic Forum.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient.

There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth.

But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to.

I think I did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the moments before the shooting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him.

This year, it will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has invited them as chief guests for the celebrations, placing the European Union at the centre of one of the country's most prestigious state events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this day, India turns the heart of its capital into a stage.

The chief guests have been from leaders of neighbouring countries - such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka - to heads of state and government from major powers, including the US and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has featured as the chief guest five times - including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - reflecting the long and complex history between the two countries.

The fact that India has a guest almost every year is one of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, for most countries, these parades commemorate military victories.

Following the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyr6p30054o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest Russian bombardment </a>overnight into 24 January, almost 6,000 apartment blocks were left without heating, according to mayor Vitaly Klitschko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the third such Russian attack targeting Kyiv's heating infrastructure in little more than two weeks, after strikes on 9 and 20 January also left hundreds of thousands freezing in their flats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Living in Kyiv is a bit of a gamble these days,\" one resident of the Ukrainian capital, Rita, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have heating and gas, there is no electricity and water. If you have electricity and water, there is no heating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Coming home is like playing a guessing game every day - will I be able to shower or have hot tea, or neither? And of course missiles and drones come on top of all that.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says she has to go to bed wearing a hat and several layers of clothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What is making things much worse for Ukraine and easier for Russia is the widespread prevalence of apartment blocks that rely on communal central heating - where water is heated up elsewhere and then pumped into their radiators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Heating plants in Ukraine are huge and many thousands of people are affected when they are targeted by Russian forces. Ukraine says that all such power plants have now been hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks also disrupt electricity supplies, but while a generator or battery pack might help in this situation, heating is less straightforward - especially when there is also no electricity to power your heater.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyivteploenergo, the monopoly supplying heating and hot water in the Ukrainian capital, told the BBC \"the absolute majority\" of houses in Kyiv rely on its services. It said it could not share the exact number for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Zaporizhzhia, a frontline city home to 750,000 people, almost three-quarters of residents rely on central heating, according to Maksym Rohalsky, the head of the local association of apartment block dwellers.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d63/live/682690c0-f916-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Large tents in Kyiv at night for local residents to get warm, with the orange glow of lighting visible inside\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The authorities in Kyiv have set up tents where local residents can get warm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Russia's full-scale invasion of 2022, about 11 million households in Ukraine relied on central heating, compared to seven million autonomously heated households, Ukrainian energy expert Yuriy Korolchuk said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cities across the Soviet Union, including in Ukraine, were the focus of huge construction programmes launched in the 1950s to mass produce cheap housing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The landscapes of cities in the former USSR are dominated by ubiquitous nine-storey residential buildings made from pre-fabricated concrete panels, known as \"panelki\", or smaller five-storey blocks of flats known as \"khrushchevki\", after Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who oversaw their construction in the 1950s and 1960s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Heating to such houses is supplied by large plants known as TETs - an acronym that stands for \"heat and electricity centrals\" in Ukrainian as they generate electricity as well as heat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Detached houses occupied by a single family, known as \"private houses\" in Ukraine, are normally found in rural areas and are rare in cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ukraine inherited the Soviet heating system and it hasn't changed anything, it stays predominantly centralised,\" Korolchuk told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These heating plants were not designed to be attacked with missiles or drones, that's why these vulnerabilities came to the fore during the war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to him, this is a new tactic used by Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During the previous winters, there were no such strikes against the heating system. They happened only occasionally, and they didn't directly target heating plants,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to ongoing talks to end the war, he says \"the factor of negotiations is now possibly playing a role, it's a form of pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large centralised installations bring about efficiencies of scale, but should they be targeted by bombs or drones, the consequences can be devastating for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government is acutely aware of this vulnerability, and is planning to reduce it by making individual heating points mandatory at apartment blocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, undoing decades of Soviet urban planning will not be quick or easy.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are shark attacks increasing overall?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d03e/live/88cd7970-f843-11f0-8ab6-81a112385ec5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A beach with two signposts, one saying \"Swimming prohibited beach closed\" next to a crossed our symbol of a person swimming, the other saying \"Shark sighted\" next to a symbol of a shark underwater' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do shark culls work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts reject the suggestion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How can people avoid shark attacks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, other data tells a different story: Spain was bottom of an index published by German railway association Allianz pro Schiene of spending per capita on rail infrastructure by 14 European countries in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón, head of the civil engineering department at Cartagena's University-Polytechnic, described the high-speed network as being \"the jewel in the crown of Spanish infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the liberalisation of the rail sector in 2020, allowing France's Ouigo and Italy's Iryo to provide high-speed services, may have increased competitivity and reduced ticket prices, but it has also put more pressure on the system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 22 million travellers currently use Spain's high-speed trains each year, around double the number prior to the liberalisation, and 17 times the number of users in 1992, the year the Madrid-Seville line was inaugurated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Salvador García-Ayllón also points to new lines which have been built over recent years – including the north-western region of Galicia and the northern city of Burgos, with a new route along the Mediterranean under construction – whose upkeep presents a challenge. All of this, he said, has left Spanish rail \"bursting at the seams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The challenge is not just to buy a Ferrari, you have to take the Ferrari to the garage,\" he said. \"You have to invest in maintaining the infrastructure you have.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high-speed rail system's reliability has dropped noticeably in recent years. In July of 2025, its trains were 19 minutes late on average, according to data provided by Renfe. Local rail has also seen a rise in incidences, such as delays, cancellations and technical problems, which have more than tripled since 2019 on the Madrid local Cercanías network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Catalonia, which suffered the double accident on Tuesday, has had longstanding and well-documented deficiencies in its suburban Rodalies network, which have fed into its political tensions with Madrid over the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps inevitably, the recent tragedies have already spilled into the deeply divided political arena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right party Vox has said that \"travelling in Spain [by train] is no longer safe\", a claim that fits into its repeated insistence that the country is akin to a failed state. The main opposition People's Party (PP), meanwhile, has accused the government of hiding information about the high-speed crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has acknowledged that the accident in southern Spain caused \"irreparable\" damage. Yet he also insisted that the high-speed network \"is the cause of pride for the country\". Not so long ago, few Spaniards would have queried that assertion. Now, many will find it hard to agree.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
