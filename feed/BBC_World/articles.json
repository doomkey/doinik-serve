Greenland's prime minister said the island must \"decide our own future\" and its \"territorial integrity must be respected\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gov Landry said in a post on X that it was an honour to serve in a \"volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has revived his long-standing interest in Greenland, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has refused to rule out using force to secure control of the island, a stance that has shocked Denmark, a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We'll have to work that out,\" Trump added. \"We need Greenland for national security, not minerals.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump specifically mentioned Chinese and Russian ships as potential threats in the nearby seas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump's appointment of Greenland envoy sparks fresh row with Denmark</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark's Foreign Minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, described the appointment of Landry as \"deeply upsetting\" and warned Washington to respect Danish sovereignty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told Danish broadcaster TV2: \"As long as we have a kingdom consisting of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, we cannot accept actions that undermine our territorial integrity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the territory was willing to cooperate with the US and other countries, but only on the basis of mutual respect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said: \"The appointment of a special envoy does not change anything for us.

Last week, he warned that the focus of the war \"may have shifted towards Odesa\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Volodymyr Zelensky said the repeated attacks were an attempt by Moscow to block Ukraine's access to maritime logistics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the sea as retaliation for drone attacks on tankers of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Shadow fleet\" is a term that refers to hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday evening, strikes hit port infrastructure in Odesa, damaging a civilian vessel, the regional governor said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the latest in a series of hundreds of strikes which have disrupted power supplies in the region for days on end and caused several casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday night, strikes cut off electricity for 120,000 people and sparked a fire at a major port which destroyed dozens of containers of flour and vegetable oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, a ballistic missile strike on the Pivdenniy port east of Odesa killed eight people and injured at least 30.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another attack earlier in the week killed a woman who was travelling in a car with her three children and temporarily cut off the Odesa region's only bridge linking Ukraine and Moldova.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky indicated a new commander of the air force for the region would be selected soon following the dismissal of Dmytro Karpenko over the weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Odesa's port has always been key for the country's economy. The city is Ukraine's third largest after Kyiv and Kharkiv. It now occupies strategic importance as other ports in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolayiv regions are inaccessible to Ukraine due to Russian occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the war, Ukraine remains one of the world's top exporters of wheat and corn. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since August 2023, Odesa has been the starting point of a crucial corridor that allows it to export grain out of the country, following the coastlines of Romania and Bulgaria before reaching Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky, who has previously accused Russia of \"sowing chaos\" on the people of Odesa, said that \"everyone must see that without pressure on Russia, they have no intention of genuinely ending their aggression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His comments came as the latest round of US-led diplomatic efforts wrapped up in Miami. The US separately met the Ukrainian and Russian delegations, with the meetings yielding optimistic statements but no clear progress to bring the end of Moscow's nearly four-year war on Ukraine any closer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he and his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov had worked on \"aligning positions\" on a 20-point draft peace plan put forward by Ukraine earlier this month. The plan is an alternative to a proposal presented by the US in November, which was seen as favourable to Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev even returned to Moscow from Florida, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters that the European and Ukrainian changes to the peace proposal would not improve the chances of peace being achieved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused EU countries of having a \"firm aspiration\" to derail potential Russia-US agreements on Ukraine and to \"in general prevent Russia-American relations getting healthier\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said European countries were \"possessed by a maniacal\" fear of a Russian attack. Russia was ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it had no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato, Ryabkov added, echoing previous comments from Putin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've never planned to [attack Europe], but if they want to hear it from us, well, let's do it, we'll put it in writing,\" Putin said in November.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Carrera also mentioned the closure this year of a local sugar-beet factory which caused the loss of dozens of jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another town in the León province that was heavily affected by the summer's fires, Villablino, also took a massive share of the jackpot, receiving €200 million (£175m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We needed some good news,\" said the mayor, Mario Rivas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On top of the blazes, five local men were killed in two separate mining accidents in nearby Asturias this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't make up for the loss of the lives of our friends, but this shows us that there can also be good news,\" said Rivas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the winning tickets in Villablino were sold by a local Alzheimer's association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition, the town of La Pola de Gordón, also in León and with a population of 3,000, shared out 60 million euros. Sixty-four million euros of jackpot money also went to a working-class district in Madrid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Villablino, Maribel Martín had one of the winning décimos, worth €400,000 (£349,484). She was out doing grocery shopping when her son called her to give her the good news.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were really down and 200 million euros is a wonderful thing,\" she said</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is clear what she wants to do with the prize money. \"Spread it around a bit and enjoy life,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as \"piracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current chase is related to a \"sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela's illegal sanctions evasion\", a US official told the BBC's partner CBS News.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late on Saturday the US Coast Guard approached an oil tanker, which US officials said was not flying a valid national flag, the New York Times reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Confirming the chase on Monday, President Trump said: \"It's moving along. We'll end up getting it.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president said that the US would hold onto the seized oil and the vessels carrying it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're going to keep it... maybe we'll sell it, maybe we'll keep it\", he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe we'll use it in the strategic reserves. We're keeping it, we're keeping the ships also.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had been in touch with the \"big\" American oil companies about the seizures, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">British maritime risk management group Vanguard identified the tanker as Bella 1, a very large crude oil carrier which reportedly was on its way to Venezuela to pick up oil.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2399\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list last year for allegedly \"carrying sanctioned cargo\"</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it added the Bella 1 to its sanctions list, the US Treasury Department accused its registered owner of having links to Iran and of providing support to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NYT reports the tanker \"did not submit to being boarded\" and fled northeast into the Atlantic Ocean with the US Coast Guard in pursuit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has been analysing 50 distress signals transmitted by Bella 1, the first of which was picked up at 13:44 GMT on 21 December, 461km (286 miles) north east of Antigua and Barbuda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The final distress call was received at 17:13 GMT the same day, around 60km (37 miles) further north east in the Atlantic Ocean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The distance between the two points suggests it was travelling at a speed of around 10 knots (11.5mph).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Bella 1 is the third oil tanker to be targeted by the US in waters off Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 10 December, the Coast Guard seized the Skipper, which US Attorney General Pam Bondi said was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela to Iran\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper has since been taken under escort to Galveston in Texas, where it arrived on Sunday. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Coast Guard personnel boarded a tanker with the name Centuries written on its side. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Centuries does not appear on the US Treasury's list of sanctioned vessels, the White House said that it carried oil from Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that the Centuries was \"operating as part of the Venezuelan shadow fleet to traffic stolen oil and fund the narcoterrorist Maduro regime\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seizure of the tankers is the latest development in the US's pressure campaign against the government of Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump returned into office in January, the US has doubled the reward it offers for information leading to Maduro's capture, declared his government a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and last week, ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on profits from oil exports to finance its spending, this latest move has caused particular outrage with Venezuelan officials. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While President Maduro did not refer to the seizure of the Centuries or the pursuit of the Bella 1 directly, he denounced US actions as \"piracy\" in comments he made on Sunday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has also accused the US of trying to seize Venezuela's oil riches - the South American country has the world's largest proven oil reserves. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Venezuela's request, the United Nations Security will hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what Caracas has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China on Monday appeared to side with Venezuela with a spokesperson for the  foreign ministry denouncing \"unilateral and illegal sanctions that lack a basis in international law or authorisation by the United Nations Security Council\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The spokesperson added that \"Venezuela has the right to develop independently and engage in a mutually beneficial cooperation with other nations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a phone call with his Venezuelan counterpart on Monday, after which Russia expressed \"full support for and solidarity with the Venezuelan leadership\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Russia and China have supported the Venezuelan government financially and militarily for years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But during the current situation, experts say <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c075mr3190mo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">that backing seems to be largely symbolic</a>, with statements being given in support rather than concrete military or financial aid.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Siwar Ashour, whose story the BBC has followed for several months, was repatriated to Gaza on 3 December after completing her medical treatment in Amman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She'd spent six months in hospital there under a medical evacuation programme run by the Kingdom of Jordan. Her grandmother, Sahar Ashour, said she became ill three days after coming back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She started having diarrhoea and vomiting and her situation keeps getting worse. The diarrhoea won't go away,\" she told a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering Gaza independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar is being treated at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip where Dr Khalil al-Daqran told the BBC she is \"receiving the necessary treatment, but the situation is still bad for her\". The doctor said Siwar was suffering from a gastro-intestinal infection. She has an immune system deficiency which makes it hard for her to fight bacteria. She also struggles to absorb nutrition, meaning she requires specialised baby formula.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Khalil al-Daqran said poor hygiene conditions had disease to spread</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Daqran said that hospitals in Gaza - many of which were badly damaged by Israeli bombing and fighting nearby with Hamas before a ceasefire took effect in October - were seeing an increase in child admissions. Poor hygiene conditions caused by the destruction of vital infrastructure have led to the spread of infections and disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Since the ceasefire was announced, the number of child patients arriving at Gaza Strip hospitals is three times the capacity… The situation at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is no different from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, and a major shortage regarding electric generators, which are the main artery to keep a hospital going.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World Health Organization (WHO) described humanitarian needs in Gaza as \"staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar was evacuated to Jordan in June after the BBC reported on her case and raised it directly with the Jordanian authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jordan's Minister of Communications, Dr Mohammed al-Momani, told us that Siwar was among 45 children returned to Gaza after completing their treatment. Under the evacuation scheme all patients are sent back after medical attention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I put it to Dr al-Momani that people might find it hard to accept that a child in such a vulnerable condition could be sent back to Gaza in the current conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No patient is sent back before they finish their medical treatment… the first reason [why they are returned] is that this will allow us to bring more patients from Gaza. We cannot take all of them at once. We have to take them in batches. So far we have taken 18 batches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The second reason is that we don't want to contribute in any shape or form to the displacement of Palestinians from their land and all patients are told… after treatment you are sent back so other patients and other children can be brought in for treatment.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Mohammed al-Momani says patients are sent back from Jordan after medical treatment to allow authorities to bring in new patients from Gaza</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jordan also treats war wounded at its field hospital in Gaza and has supplied aid via air drops and road convoys. The kingdom hosts more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, who fled conflicts with Israel since 1948, and 500,000 refugees from other countries, mostly Syrians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since last March some 300 sick and wounded children and 730 parents and guardians have been brought to Jordan out of 2000 scheduled for treatment. Other countries in the region like the United Arab Emirates and Turkey have treated thousands of sick civilians from Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The specialised formula milk Siwar needs was either not available or in very short supply during the ongoing conflict. In March, Israel imposed a total blockade on aid into Gaza that was lifted partially after 11 weeks. Since the ceasefire there has been a surge in aid deliveries, although the UN and aid agencies say not enough humanitarian supplies are flowing.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Siwar's family are trying to get her evacuated once more due to her condition</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Jordanian authorities gave Siwar's family a supply of 12 cans of the hypoallergenic Neocate formula on their departure for Gaza. However her mother Najwa told us that Israeli officials confiscated much of what they'd been given -  nine of their 12 cans were taken. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They told us, 'It is forbidden to take more than these cans,'\" said Siwar's mother, Najwa Ashour. \"Even though it is therapeutic milk and they said that treatment is allowed, yet they took them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also said that extra clothing the family had been given in Jordan was taken. \"They searched us from top to bottom. When they saw us wearing clothes over each other [layered] they refused to let us out, and told us, 'You must take off all the clothes, down to one outfit.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked the Israeli government why the milk formula and clothing were confiscated? They replied that limits were placed on what could be taken back for \"security considerations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said only minimal luggage was allowed and this had been conveyed to the Jordanian authorities and the returning families. \"In cases where the luggage exceeded the approved scope, its entry was denied.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The WHO has appealed for more countries to offer medical evacuation to patients who cannot get the necessary treatment in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also called on the Israeli government to allow patients to be treated in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank \"which is the most time and cost effective route.\" Israel stopped allowing such evacuations after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cogat, the Israeli military bosy in charge of aid, said the process for Gazan residents' departure to third countries had been substantially eased.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar's family has been given Neocate milk formula since returning to Gaza. There have also been donations of money, including funds raised from online appeals. Jordanian representatives in Gaza have also visited the family to provide assistance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ashours are trying to have Siwar evacuated once more - a process that has begun with the issuing of a permit by Palestinian health officials. It will be managed by the WHO which deals with all evacuation requests from a place the UN calls \"a wasteland\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-by-malak-hassouneh,-suha-kawar-and-alice-doyard.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Suha Kawar and Alice Doyard.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

His \"passion\" for rare antiques has been put forward by his lawyer as being behind his alleged involvement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Le Parisien - which first reported on the case - he was working as a guard at the Louvre at the time and has been barred from returning until the trial is completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trial is scheduled for February.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent fighting has seen <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mpje3e2xmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border</a>. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jonathan-head-and-thanyarat-doksone\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77.

Schumer appealed for support from Republican senators, pointing out that the law to release of the full trove was a bipartisan effort. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The phrase \"Epstein files\" refer to the trove of information that was amassed by the US justice department during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A law that compelled the release of the full trove was signed by US President Donald Trump in November, after pressure from his supporters and members of his own Republican Party. Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2019/06/house-panel-contempt-efforts/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the American Bar Association</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out in Sunday's interview. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During an interview of his own on Sunday, with a different broadcaster, Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the aftermath of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjg22rey0lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Bondi attacks</a>, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxql12317qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Australia's deadliest mass shooting</a>, welcomed the reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-katy-watson\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Katy Watson</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

But she has not disputed specific quotes, including her assertion that Trump has not yet solidified a lasting Republican majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are inordinately interested in Epstein are the new members of the Trump coalition, the people that I think about all the time – because I want to make sure that they are not [only] Trump voters, they're Republican voters,\" she told the magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polls and experts back up the chief of staff's concerns about the tenuous nature of Trump's coalition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A survey released in early December by the right-wing Manhattan Institute think tank labelled nearly a third of Trump's supporters \"New Entrant Republicans\" – people who voted for the party for the first time in 2024. And the poll found that just over half of that category would \"definitely\" support a Republican in the 2026 mid-term elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These voters are drawn to Trump but are not reliably attached to the Republican Party,\" the institute concluded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The possible fragility of the Trump coalition is playing out on several different levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One crucial group is a collection of social media stars and podcasters who stand mostly outside traditional Republican circles but have clout and influence online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were instrumental in keeping social media attention on the Epstein story long after the convicted sex offender's death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group of influencers – including \"Libs of TikTok\" creator Chaya Raichik, conspiracy theorist and Turning Point USA activist Jack Posobiec, and elections organiser Scott Presler – were<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>even invited to an event at the Department of Justice (DoJ) and given binders, which Bondi described as a \"first phase\" of Epstein document releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Little if anything new was in the binders, which caused a backlash. Outrage swelled further in July after the DoJ released a memo saying that there was no Epstein \"client list\" and rejecting conspiracy theories about his death in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet following the most recent release, many of these same conservative influencers have been curiously silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Laura Loomer, a popular Maga social media influencer who has helped spread Epstein conspiracies online, claimed that they exonerated Trump from any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe now the media will stop obsessing over these files,\" wrote Loomer, who has mentioned Epstein at least 200 times on X this year alone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others - including several who were at the DoJ binder event - have not mentioned the document release at all, positively or negatively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their silence has been noted by other right-wing and far-right commentators, sparking online Maga infighting.

There was a lot of confusion... it happened really, really fast,\" Anthonin<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What was, you know, puzzling and alarming is that there were very few life jackets, around like, 15 life jackets maximum... [it] was really bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the boat continued to capsize, passengers shouted to a passing boat for help, but it did not stop - possibly because, according to him, it was relatively small.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second one, however, did stop and take them in. However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 27-year-old told the BBC that as the rescue boat came closer to their ferry, people started to shift and put weight on one side of the ferry, causing water to fill up the hull even quicker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Cook went to the other side to climb up on the roof, from where he jumped onto the rescue ferry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others. Both Anthonin<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>and Mr Cook were among those rescued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But others were less fortunate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anthonin<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>says he was helping some other passengers retrieve their luggage at the back of the sinking ferry when he saw a Lao mother and her two children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, when he was on the rescue ferry, he realised they weren't there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some people were crying, panicking. It was a mess,\" he said. \"[But] I didn't fear for my life... I was more affected by the three missing people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lao media later reported that the body of the Lao woman Pany Her and a one-year-old child were found, separately, near Luang Prabang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another passenger, Gabrielius Baranovičius, 19, told the BBC that he and his friend, both of whom are from Lithuania, did not panic at first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were just joking around,\" Mr Baranovičius said, adding that his attitude quickly changed when he realised they were sinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After getting on the rescue boat, Mr Baranovičius said he starting filming what was happening on board \"but then I heard other people screaming so [I] turned off the camera and went straight to help other people in the water get on the boat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of tourists use slow boat and speedboat services every year along the 300km (185-mile) route connecting Huay Xay, Pak Beng and Luang Prabang, according to the Mekong River Commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Mr Cook, the experience was \"terrifying\" and it made him want to get out of Luang Prabang, \"although everyone's really friendly here\", because it was a constant reminder of his narrow escape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC from Vang Vieng, a town in northern Laos, Mr Cook said he planned to file for insurance claims for his electrical items that were broken and for cash that was lost, though he was not sure who would be held responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm assuming it's just a freak accident,\" he said, though he added he \"was not sure how avoidable\" the ferry capsizing was.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not the first time such a sinking has occurred in Laos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September 2023, a passenger boat, which travelled on the same river corridor between Huay Xai and Luang Prabang, capsized in the Mekong in Pakbeng district, resulting in three deaths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boat reportedly became entangled in a fishing net, causing loss of control and the vessel overturning in strong currents.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is also among the world's most studied anti-poverty programmes, with strong equity: over half of the estimated 126 million scheme workers are women, and around 40% come from \"scheduled castes\" or tribes, among the most deprived Indians</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling Narendra Modi government, initially critical and later inclined to pare it back, turned to the scheme in crises -  most notably during the Covid pandemic, when mass return migration from cities to villages sharply drove up demand for work. Economists say the scheme lifted rural consumption, reduced poverty, improved school attendance, and in some regions pushed up private-sector wages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, the government introduced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Summary-Viksit_Bharat_GRamG_Bill_2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new law</a> that repeals and rebrands the scheme. The programme - renamed MGNREGA in 2009 to honour Mahatma Gandhi - has now dropped his name altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the renaming drew the political heat, the more consequential changes lie in what the new law - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/g-ram-g-bill-kya-hai-what-is-g-ram-g-bill-g-ram-g-explained-g-ram-g-full-firm-g-ram-g-protests-bill-to-replace-mnrega-9845618\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">known as G RAM G for shor</a>t - actually does.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raises the annual employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days per rural household. It retains the provision that workers not given jobs within 15 days are entitled to an unemployment allowance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the original scheme, the federal government paid all labour wages and most material costs - roughly a 90:10 split with the states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Funding will now follow a 60:40 split between the federal government and most states. That could push states' contribution to 40% or more of total project cost.

West Bengal's programme, for example, has faced deep cuts and funding freezes since 2022, with the federal government halting funds over alleged non-compliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet despite these challenges, the scheme appears to have delivered measurable impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An influential <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/SmartcardsGE.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">study</a> by economists Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehaus, and Sandip Sukhtankar found that the broader, economy-wide impacts of the scheme boosted beneficiary households' earnings by 14% and cut poverty by 26%. Workers demanded higher wages, land returns fell, and job gains were larger in villages, the study found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many say the scheme's durability also underscores a deeper structural problem: India's chronic inability to generate enough non-farm jobs to absorb surplus rural labour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agriculture has consistently lagged behind the broader economy, growing just 3% annually since 2001–02, compared with 7% for the rest of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics such as Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution, a think-tank, argue that the scheme cushions distress but does little to raise long-term rural productivity, and may even blunt incentives for agricultural reform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With [the scheme] we're merely treating a serious underlying malaise with steroids,\" said Mr Pai in a post on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's Economic Survey 2023–24 questions whether demand under the scheme truly mirrors rural hardship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If that was the case, data should show higher fund use and employment in poorer states with higher unemployment, the survey says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, it notes, Tamil Nadu, with under 1% of the country's poor, received nearly 15% of the scheme's funds, while Kerala, with just 0.1% of the poor, accounted for almost 4% of federal allocations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survey adds that the actual work generated depends largely on a state's administrative capacity: states with trained staff can process requests on time, directly influencing how much employment is provided.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images) Women working for lake rejuvenation under MNREGA scheme at Bevanahalli village in Mandya, India.

But the water remains in a closed loop, so there is no need to continually draw more of it from local supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I ask whether the oil-based fluids in the firm's cooling system are derived from fossil fuel products and he says some of them are, though he stresses that none contain PFAS, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clydd630pxzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">also known as forever chemicals</a>, which are harmful to human health.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some liquid-based data centre cooling technologies use refrigerants that do contain PFAS. Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"Vapours can get out of the tank,\" adds Mr Wang. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Yulin Wang Yulin Wang wearing a brown hoodie smiles while sitting in a park full of pumpkins.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Yulin Wang</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Yulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Microsoft famously <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54146718\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sank a tube-like container</a> full of servers into the sea off Orkney, for example. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Microsoft confirmed that it had shuttered the project. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Data centres that are more hands-off appear more reliable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. And it required zero water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. \"You can think of a liquid cooling maze through the silicon at nanometre scale,\" says Mr Speirs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Researchers are coming up with other ideas, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435125001564\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">published a paper</a> detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Essentially, you are using heat to provide the pumping power,\" says Prof Chen. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. Prof Chen says he hopes to commercialise the technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sashaluccioni.com/assets/AI%20+%20Environment%20Primer%20(Hugging%20Face).pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In previous research</a>, Dr Luccioni has shown that such technologies eat up lots of energy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/26/ai-reasoning-models-problem.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Reasoning models</a>, which explain their output in multiple steps, are even more demanding, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They use \"hundreds or thousands of times more energy\" than standard chat bots that just answer questions. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More Technology of Business</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Barbara Schwartz (on right) with other volunteers at the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple<b id=\":\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">:</b> If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sammi Cooper is opposed to abortion and protests against the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68580015\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Comstock Act</a>, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

For Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, it is an effective way of attracting tourists outside of the country's main summer season.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The words \"tourism\" and \"Croatia\" are likely to conjure visons of sparkling Adriatic vistas during the hottest months of the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism accounts for more than a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theinternational.si/croatia-tourism-2025-investment-transformation/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">fifth of the economy</a> of this Balkan country, and it is keen to encourage more visitors to arrive outside of the height of summer. Yuletide frolics are a key part of that strategy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're making a transformation,\" says Croatia's Tourism Minister, Tonci Glavina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are developing as a year-round tourism destination – we are not a summer destination anymore. Croatia has really made a significant development. At some point way back it was just sun and sea, but now Croatia offers many tourism products all across the country.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb Advent, as the capital's Christmas markets and events are collectively known, is the poster child for this approach, with billboards in neighbouring countries urging people to attend. In fact, this year the campaign has spread as far as London's tube stations and Milan's buses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are even special trains to bring visitors from Slovenia and Hungary. All of it is part of Zagreb's push, in a very crowded field, to become one of Europe's most popular Christmas markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While some cities might limit their offering to a single location, Zagreb Advent is a multi-venue spectacular that takes over large chunks of the centre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The entire city has become a festive ground for celebrating Christmas throughout the whole of December,\" says Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the Christmas market areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's really special around here is that each of the locations has its own theme, and it's a little bit different in decoration, and in the content that it offers. So for a visitor, I think it's a good deal, because by taking a walk through Zagreb, you can see many different spots.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like other Christmas markets across Europe there are no shortages of the usual seasonal staples, such as sausages and mulled wine. But there are also multiple music stages, craft stalls, vendors offering traditional Croatian food, art installations, and an enormous ice rink.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the market areas, says that Zagreb offers festive variety</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It brings life to Zagreb,\" reckons Zrinka Farina, who is involved with putting on Christmas market events outside the city's historic Hotel Esplanade, as well as a food and music market at nearby Strossmayer Square called Fuliranje – which roughly translates as \"fooling around\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says that Croatians are deadly serious about trying to offer Europe's best Christmas market. \"We are such a sporty nation, we love to compete – and when we do something, we really want to be the best in the world in it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such has been the effort that the city has put into Zagreb Advent since it was first held in 2014 that it was voted the best Christmas market in Europe for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.timeout.com/croatia/news/zagreb-scoops-prize-for-best-christmas-market-in-europe-for-the-third-year-running-121117\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">three years in a row</a>, from 2015 to 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The competition is organised by travel website European Best Destinations, and Zagreb's success has helped to drive visitor numbers to the city every December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in 2014, the city saw 100,198 people stay for at least one night during the last month of the year. By 2024 this had more than doubled to 245,352, which the tourist board says gave the city a €100m ($117m; £88m) economic boost.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zagreb Advent event is spread across the centre of the city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Zagreb has a long way to go if it wishes to catch up with Europe's Christmas market heavyweights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one held in the German city of Cologne is widely reported to be the most popular. It is expected to attract <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datappeal.io/most-attended-christmas-markets-in-europe-2025/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">four million visitors this year,</a> with an economic impact of €229m.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Austria's capital Vienna attracts around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visitingvienna.com/sights/christmasmarkets/rathausplatz/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2.8 million visitors</a> to its Christmas market, and France's Strasbourg gets <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visitstrasbourg.fr/en/discover/the-capital-of-christmas/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">two million people.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb's event also has a limited history – it is only in its 11th year. By contrast, Dresden's Christmas market, widely considered to be the world's oldest, was first held in 1434. Strasbourg's began in 1570, Vienna in 1764 and Cologne in 1820.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its infancy, Zagreb Advent is said to be attracting visitors from across Europe. \"They come here from Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Slovenia and even the UK,\" says Lucija Vrkljan, who is working as a steward at the ice rink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a great place to be,\" says Dario Kozul, the founder of BioMania, a bistro with a stall offering vegan and gluten-free food at the Hotel Esplanade Christmas market.  \"We have a cross-marketing situation all the time,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People walk into this event and test our food – they're really very pleased with it. Then we talk about our restaurant, and within the next couple of days, we see them there.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images People at Dresden's Christmas market\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dresden's Christmas market was first held in 1434</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marko Peric, dean of the Faculty of Tourism at Croatia's University of Rijeka, agrees that Zagreb Advent brings \"unusually high\" numbers of arrivals and overnight stays in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he cautions that the rest of Croatia's heavy reliance on the summer season is a weakness that still needs to be addressed. \"We need to work and develop our tourist offer in other parts of the year, including the winter,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have snow, but we can offer a lot. We should rely on our gastronomy, which is well known, with many tourists arriving just because of that. And we could use other types of events like carnival in February, or sporting events.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism Minister Tonci Glavina insists that Croatia is making moves in the right direction. He points out that visitor numbers over July and August were actually slightly down on the same period in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the country is still on course for a record-breaking year, thanks to significant growth either side of the summer peak, with around 5% more arrivals in June and September. This, says the minister, is \"just perfect\", as is the 10% year-on-year rise over the first week of December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are transforming Croatia to be a sustainable tourism destination, meaning about the same number of guests in peak season, developing the shoulder seasons, and of course developing other parts of the country to be main tourism destinations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb Advent has already shown the benefits. Although that may not be the first thing that springs to a visitor's mind with all the traditional Croatian treats on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, what could be better than some post-skate fritule doughnuts, except perhaps a fritule with chocolate sauce.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
