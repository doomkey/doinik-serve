He said Russia was willing to \"show flexibility\" but was also prepared to fight on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later in the day, US President Donald Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the plan, adding that otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his 10-minute address in front of the presidential office in Kyiv, Zelensky warned that Ukraine would face \"a lot of pressure... to weaken us, to divide us\", adding that \"the enemy is not sleeping\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Urging Ukrainians to stay united, he stressed that the country's \"national interest must be taken into account\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not making loud statements,\" he went on, \"we'll be calmly working with America and all the partners... offering alternatives\" to the proposed peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky also said he had been reassured of continuous support during a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir said late on Friday that Ukraine's allies remained committed to securing \"a just and lasting peace once and for all\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceq0q39812qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the G20 summit, which begins on Saturday in South Africa</a>, the prime minister said he and other world leaders would \"discuss the current proposal on the table, and in support of President Trump's push for peace, look at how we can strengthen this plan for the next phase of negotiations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is not attending the gathering over widely discredited claims that white people are being persecuted in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, Zelensky said he had spoken \"for almost an hour\" with US Vice-President JD Vance and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, adding that Ukraine \"always respected\" Trump's efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Washington, Trump warned that Ukraine would lose more territory to Russia \"in a short amount of time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said it was \"appropriate\" to give Ukraine until 27 November - Thanksgiving in the US - to agree to the peace deal, but added deadlines could be extended if things were \"going well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking at the White House on Friday, the US president said \"we think we have a way of getting peace\", adding that Zelensky \"is going to have to approve it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has been pressing Kyiv to quickly accept the plan, and sent senior Pentagon officials to the Ukrainian capital earlier this week.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cd2d/live/10947410-c6ff-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA/Shutterstock Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses his army commanders during a visit to a command post.

Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US plan also limits Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and that Nato will not expand further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainians both under and free of Russian occupation struck a defiant tone in reaction to news of the US proposal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Kyiv, the widow of a Ukrainian soldier told the BBC: \"This is not a peace plan, it is a plan to continue the war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another person speaking from one of the occupied territories in Ukraine told the BBC: \"I'm trying to keep my sanity here in the conditions of constant propaganda that Ukraine has forgotten us. I hope they will not sign this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory and its troops have been making slow advances along the vast front line, despite reported heavy losses.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many.

That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed.

It has firmly denied claims of a white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it wouldn't take part in any discussions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters earlier this week that there's only one way they would not attend next year's meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are members of the G20, we're not an invited country. So we don't need an invitation from anybody,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way they can do it is to decline us visas.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump show President Cyril Ramaphosa a pile of documents\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">At a meeting earlier this year, Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, with widely discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of the world's wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will not attach much weight to [the US' absence],\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for real consensus, because people won't be constantly looking over their shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his positioning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint declaration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Answering reporters' questions at the summit's venue in Johannesburg on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this sentiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries that are present must make a decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that we must adopt a leaders' declaration because the institution cannot be bogged down by someone who's absent,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaders' declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy, including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change. It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump isn't the only head of state who will not be attending. China's Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has represented the president in a number of meetings this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian leader <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64992727\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Vladimir Putin will also be absent due to the International Criminal Court's warrant against him</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be attending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping the summit in solidarity with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior delegations to represent their countries' interests.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences, saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and it is \"nothing abnormal\" for them to send a replacement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other global powers have expressed their support of South Africa's presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union, which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries have long argued that processing minerals in their countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing much-needed development, jobs and income.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in this current cycle. It's also the last country in the global south to host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As such, the South African government says it wants to use its presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared prosperity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although building consensus through multilateral institutions like the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges, whether it's climate change, demographic shifts, technological revolution and so on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society. And you can't deal with them unless there is international collaboration and cooperation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral organisations do little to change real people's lives, preferring instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done through one-on-one deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, South Africa's presidency of the G20 is part of a wider debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that consensus can be reached without the participation of the world's most powerful country.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More BBC stories about South Africa:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

So far 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes, according to US statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the campaign is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration justifies them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives by stopping drugs from entering the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the strikes have attracted condemnation in countries in the region and concern that they breach international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has criticised the strikes, saying Colombian citizens were on board the boat hit on 15 September, and later claiming Mr Carranza was among those killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to his first statement about Colombian citizens being killed, the White House said it looked forward to President Petro \"publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also accused Petro of encouraging the production of drugs and threated to cut off US aid to Colombia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza comes from a huge family, living with about 20 relatives in a small house off a dirt track in the fishing village of Gaira.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Petro <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa/Paginas/La-sociedad-norteamericana-debe-saber-que-estan-asesinando-gente-pobre-251108.aspx\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged</a> that he wanted to help his daughter study at university, and so accepted a payment from a drug trafficker to transport some drugs to an island, when his boat was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But whether it was fish or cocaine [he was transporting], he wasn't subject to the death penalty,\" Petro said. He accused the US of \"murder\" and since said he ordered Colombian public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the strikes end. His defence minister later said the president had given \"clear instructions to maintain, as has been done, a continuous flow of information with international agencies to combat drug trafficking\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza has a past criminal record over stealing weapons from the police nine years ago, but his family deny – and say they are hurt by – characterisations of him as a narco-trafficker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What the president of the United States is doing isn't right. He has to prove if they are or aren't [trafficking],\" Lizbeth says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says while Trump may want to tackle issues affecting his \"territory\" that \"doesn't mean he should resort to these methods… of taking someone's life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US lawyer working for some of Mr Carranza's family, Daniel Kovalik, who also works for President Petro, says Mr Carranza's wife and older daughter recognised his boat from the US-released footage of the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He intends to sue the US government on the family's behalf. International law says the military cannot kill civilians unless they pose an imminent threat of violence, even if engaging in criminal activity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if you claim that the people you're killing are trafficking drugs, you don't have the right to just engage in extrajudicial killings,\" Mr Kovalik said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're tiny boats… If you really believe they were doing something wrong, those people should be arrested, tried in a court of law, convicted, and sentenced.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And, by the way, none of them would be sentenced to the death penalty – this is not a capital crime.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has told Congress that it believes the US is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In doing so, it appears to be invoking war-time powers, such as killing enemy combatants even if they pose no immediate violent threat, to justify the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said the US is \"under threat\" from \"terrorist organisations\" and said drugs kill thousands of Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says seizures of cocaine – the major drug trafficked and produced in South America – rose by about 18% in 2024 compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the main driver of drug deaths in the US is Fentanyl, which is produced and arrives in the US from Mexico.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kovalik does not buy the US's self-defence argument, saying \"these boats have never attacked the United States\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Juan Assis Tejeda says he and his fellow fishermen are fearful they could be targeted by strikes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Taganga, the strikes are causing apprehension for fishermen like 81-year-old Juan Assis Tejeda, whose skin is tanned and leathered from 70 years fishing these waters under the Caribbean's baking sun – just like his grandfather and father before him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He regularly fishes near the border with Venezuela, just along the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He describes how he has sometimes seen drones flying over them while out fishing that \"hover quietly, come back again, and disappear\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though he is just fishing, he is now fearful because of the ongoing strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At any moment they could see us and think we're doing the same thing. Because sometimes we also go 60 miles or so out to sea, looking for tuna.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says some fishermen do get involved in transporting drugs due to poverty. He says he was once offered money himself, but he said no.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would prefer to stick to the little money that he earns and live \"peacefully\" than run the risks associated with transporting drugs, he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mr Tejeda says he has seen drones hovering while he has been out fishing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most in this region do not believe that this is just about targeting small, alleged drug-trafficking boats, but instead about the US also wanting to put military pressure on Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro to step aside – or on his allies, for example in the military, to oust him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US accuses Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation which it calls the Cartel de los Soles, something Maduro strongly denies. The US state department intends to designate this group a foreign terrorist organisation on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has added to growing speculation over whether the US will strike targets on Venezuelan soil itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said the US \"may be having some discussions with Maduro\" and Maduro responded by saying he would be prepared to talk \"face to face\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the US mulls its next move, the sleepy fishing villages that dot the Caribbean coast wonder whether diplomacy, or war, is on their horizon.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Africa</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has classified violence against women a national disaster following an online campaign culminating in countrywide protests on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women were urged to \"withdraw from the economy for one day\", and lie down for 15 minutes at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the 15 females who are murdered in the country every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state had refused to make the categorisation but changed tack after \"evaluating the persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa experiences some of the world's highest levels of gender-based violence (GBV), with the rate at which women are killed five times higher than the global average, according to UN Women.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has classified GBV and femicide a disaster following \"a thorough reassessment of previous reports and updated submissions from organs of state as well as civil organisations\", said Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NDMC had earlier said calls to make the categorisation did not meet legal requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"warning:-this-report-contains-descriptions-of-sexual-assault\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Warning: This report contains descriptions of sexual assault</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fridays \"lie downs\" happened in 15 locations across South Africa, including major cities such as Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Allies in Eswatini, Kenya and Namibia have also expressed their support for the protest and say they joined in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demonstrators wore black as a sign of \"mourning and resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protest, dubbed the G20 Women's Shutdown, has been organised by Women for Change, which has also been spearheading the online campaign that has seen many people, including celebrities, change their social media profile pictures to purple – a colour often linked to GBV awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has also been an online petition, signed by over one million people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the G20 Social Summit that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-49739977\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">South Africa had \"declared gender-based violence and femicide a national crisis\" in 2019</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly afterwards, Mr Hlabisa confirmed it had been upgraded to a national disaster and that an announcement would be made on Friday, according to Women for Change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The organisation shared a statement on its Instagram page on Thursday welcoming the news and telling its followers \"we have won\" and that their \"persistence has been recognised\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have written history together [and] we have finally forced the country to confront the truth,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The categorisation allows government departments to use their allocated budgets to \"implement every measure possible\" to reduce the scourge, the cooperative governance ministry told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If these measures fail to bring change, the government can then declare a national state of disaster which would allow for the issue to be treated with even more urgency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the announcement, Women for Change spokesperson Cameron Kasambala told the BBC that \"so many beautiful acts and legislations\" had been followed by \"lack of implementation and transparency\" on the government's part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've integrated violence… into our culture [and] into our social norms,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once the government truly reacts to this issue, I feel like we'll already be able to see a reaction on the ground. Because they set the precedent and the tone for how the country responds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grammy-award winning singer Tyla is among the thousands of celebrities and citizens who have rallied behind the call and changed their social media profiles. Some have gone further, posting pictures of purple hearts, nail polish and even clothing in what has since been dubbed the \"purple movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South African professor who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she had taken leave so she could travel to Johannesburg from Free State province to take part in the silent protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's important for her because she said she had second thoughts about simple things like jogging and hopes that the protest will \"slow the scourge\" of GBV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, some women have faced a backlash from employers for wanting to participate in the protest. One product designer who works for a major cooperation said they were strongly advised against taking part. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some women who feel the government is not doing enough have taken matters into their own hands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lynette Oxeley founded Girls on Fire to help women protect themselves through gun ownership.  It is legal to own a firearm in South Africa for self-defence if a person has a valid licence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the women in her group have been raped, attacked, robbed, or experienced some level of violence.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A growing number of women in South Africa are learning to use guns to protect themselves</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prudence joined the group after she was raped in 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I said: 'No'. I screamed, I cried but he didn't take no for an answer,\" she told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trying to find justice was an \"uphill battle\" as her case was withdrawn because her rape kit - the DNA they take after the crime - was lost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It isn't a \"police problem, it is a nation problem,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the women are trained to shoot firearms, Ms Oxeley said using a gun was a \"last resort\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about actually defending yourself with a firearm. I want ladies to change what they think about themselves. Stop being silent,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if you do not win the fight, at least you are fighting back.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More about South Africa from the BBC:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 25-year-old contestant had walked out of an event earlier in November after a Thai official publicly berated her in front of dozens of contestants and threatened to disqualify those who supported her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That dramatic turn was followed a week later by the resignation of two judges, one of whom accused organisers of rigging the competition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These come as one of the world's longest-running beauty pageants faces questions of its relevancy and a declining audience.</p></div><div

told off Ms Bosch</a> in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity, in a move that made headlines around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Miss Universe Organization condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum praised Ms Bosch at that time as an \"example of how we women should speak out\" in the face of aggression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During Friday's finals, Mr Nawat posted photos from the audience on his Instagram stories but he was not seen on stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Ms Bosch's crowning, he posted a one-line statement in Thai on his social media accounts, saying: \"A billion words that cannot be said\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also told reporters: \"As for the outcome, we leave it to the viewers at home to judge... people everywhere can make their own assessment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On social media, some fans said the backstage drama helped Ms Bosch clinch the crown, which is Mexico's fourth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Next year, whoever walks out will win,\" one comment read, while another said: \"They had to crown her to make up for injustice earlier to save Miss Universe!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the Miss Universe Organization for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On its social media accounts, the organisation praised Ms Bosch, saying \"her grace, strength, and radiant spirit captured the hearts of the world\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss Mexico</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week after the walkout controversy, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmxgymr8ewo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">two judges resigned</a> with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Miss Universe Organization rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, minutes after Ms Bosch's win was announced, Mr Harfouch posted a statement online repeating his allegations of rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a separate incident, during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clips of the incident were shared widely on social media.

She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2023, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67376299\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She resigned as CEO of JKN just before this year's pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/745c/live/276d6f50-c5f8-11f0-8e3f-494114defdeb.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Woman wearing beaded gown standing on stage\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Former owner Anne Jakrajutatip sought to make Miss Universe more inclusive</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC.

Since assuming office, US President Donald Trump has aggressively sought to terminate DEI and restore what he calls merit-based opportunity in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The senior official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: \"The United States remains committed to the Declaration of Independence's recognition that all men are endowed by the Creator with certain unalienable rights.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The official added that rights were \"given to us by God, our creator, not by governments\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other policies by foreign governments which US embassies will be told to categorise as human rights infringements include:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Subsidising abortions, \"as well as the total estimated number of annual abortions\"</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Gender-transition surgery for children, defined by the state department as \"operations involving chemical or surgical mutilation... to modify their sex\"</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Facilitating mass or illegal migration \"across a country's territory into other countries\"</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Arrests or \"official investigations or warnings for speech\" - a reference to the Trump administration's opposition to internet safety laws adopted by some European countries to deter online hate speech</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott said the new instructions are intended to stop \"new destructive ideologies [that] have given safe harbour to human rights violations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said: \"The Trump administration will not allow these human rights violations, such as the mutilation of children, laws that infringe on free speech, and racially discriminatory employment practices, to go unchecked.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"Enough is enough.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics have accused the administration of redefining long-established universal human rights principles to pursue its own ideological goals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Uzra Zeya, a former senior State Department official who now runs the charity Human Rights First, said the Trump administration was \"weaponising international human rights for domestic partisan ends\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Attempting to label DEI as a human rights violation sets a new low in the Trump administration's weaponization of international human rights,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that the new instructions excluded the rights of \"women, LGBTQI+ persons, religious and ethnic minorities, and non-believers - all of whom enjoy equal rights under US and international law, despite the meandering and obtuse rights rhetoric of the Trump Administration\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new rules conveyed \"jaw-dropping\" animosity towards LGBTQI+ people, Ms Zeya added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The State Department's annual human rights report has been seen historically as the most comprehensive study of its kind by any government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has documented abuses, including torture, extrajudicial killing and political persecution of minorities. Much of its focus and scope had remained broadly similar across Republican and Democrat administrations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new instructions follow the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy0lejvw25o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump administration's publication of the latest annual report in August</a>, which was significantly rewritten and downscaled compared to those of previous years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It reduced criticism of some US allies while escalating disapproval of perceived foes.

Since then, 14 reactors have resumed operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tepco was ordered to pay trillions of Japanese yen in damages to those affected and is also paying for the plant's decommissioning costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A survey released by Niigata prefecture last month suggested 50% of its residents supported the plant's restart, while 47% were against it. It also indicated that almost 70% of people in the prefecture were concerned about Tepco running the plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's decision demonstrates a desire among some in Japan to move towards increased use of atomic energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, as the country pursues a goal of net zero carbon emissions.</p></div></div></body></html>"

owned by Amazon -had been included as its main purpose was \"online social interaction\" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December and that from 9 January existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has previously said the ban was aimed at <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Founded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, it launched <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68069397\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plans to share more of its revenue with creators</a> as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform, and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can only join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, on which users can compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the platform was \"more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation\", she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban means tech companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz919xyx7weo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16</a> from 4 December, a week before the official ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Africa</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has classified violence against women a national disaster following an online campaign culminating in countrywide protests on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women were urged to \"withdraw from the economy for one day\", and lie down for 15 minutes at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the 15 females who are murdered in the country every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state had refused to make the categorisation but changed tack after \"evaluating the persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa experiences some of the world's highest levels of gender-based violence (GBV), with the rate at which women are killed five times higher than the global average, according to UN Women.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has classified GBV and femicide a disaster following \"a thorough reassessment of previous reports and updated submissions from organs of state as well as civil organisations\", said Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NDMC had earlier said calls to make the categorisation did not meet legal requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"warning:-this-report-contains-descriptions-of-sexual-assault\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Warning: This report contains descriptions of sexual assault</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fridays \"lie downs\" happened in 15 locations across South Africa, including major cities such as Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Allies in Eswatini, Kenya and Namibia have also expressed their support for the protest and say they joined in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demonstrators wore black as a sign of \"mourning and resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protest, dubbed the G20 Women's Shutdown, has been organised by Women for Change, which has also been spearheading the online campaign that has seen many people, including celebrities, change their social media profile pictures to purple – a colour often linked to GBV awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has also been an online petition, signed by over one million people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the G20 Social Summit that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-49739977\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">South Africa had \"declared gender-based violence and femicide a national crisis\" in 2019</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly afterwards, Mr Hlabisa confirmed it had been upgraded to a national disaster and that an announcement would be made on Friday, according to Women for Change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The organisation shared a statement on its Instagram page on Thursday welcoming the news and telling its followers \"we have won\" and that their \"persistence has been recognised\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have written history together [and] we have finally forced the country to confront the truth,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The categorisation allows government departments to use their allocated budgets to \"implement every measure possible\" to reduce the scourge, the cooperative governance ministry told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If these measures fail to bring change, the government can then declare a national state of disaster which would allow for the issue to be treated with even more urgency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the announcement, Women for Change spokesperson Cameron Kasambala told the BBC that \"so many beautiful acts and legislations\" had been followed by \"lack of implementation and transparency\" on the government's part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've integrated violence… into our culture [and] into our social norms,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once the government truly reacts to this issue, I feel like we'll already be able to see a reaction on the ground. Because they set the precedent and the tone for how the country responds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grammy-award winning singer Tyla is among the thousands of celebrities and citizens who have rallied behind the call and changed their social media profiles. Some have gone further, posting pictures of purple hearts, nail polish and even clothing in what has since been dubbed the \"purple movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South African professor who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she had taken leave so she could travel to Johannesburg from Free State province to take part in the silent protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's important for her because she said she had second thoughts about simple things like jogging and hopes that the protest will \"slow the scourge\" of GBV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, some women have faced a backlash from employers for wanting to participate in the protest. One product designer who works for a major cooperation said they were strongly advised against taking part. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some women who feel the government is not doing enough have taken matters into their own hands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lynette Oxeley founded Girls on Fire to help women protect themselves through gun ownership.  It is legal to own a firearm in South Africa for self-defence if a person has a valid licence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the women in her group have been raped, attacked, robbed, or experienced some level of violence.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A growing number of women in South Africa are learning to use guns to protect themselves</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prudence joined the group after she was raped in 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I said: 'No'.

It's a terrible thing to say, I must tell you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also suggested the US defence secretary and US deputy attorney general were looking into the matter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The video by Democrats, which was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, features Senator Mark Kelly and Representatives Chris DeLuzio, Maggie Goodlander, Chrissy Houlahan and Jason Crow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In it Kelly, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut, says: \"Our laws are clear.

Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump reacted to the video in a series of irate Truth Social posts on Thursday, accusing the lawmakers of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand,\" he wrote. \"An example MUST BE SET.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said \"the words that the president chose are not the ones that I would use\", and defended Trump, saying he was simply \"defining the crime of sedition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Johnson called the Democrats' video \"wildly inappropriate\" and \"very dangerous\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked on Friday if Trump had a responsibility to tone down hostility in US politics, Johnson said: \"I don't think you can put the blame on the president for any of that, the rhetoric is heated all the way around.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/daf7/live/29e16590-c6f5-11f0-9f8e-2fe1bf37eb14.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Elissa Slotkin with medium-length brown hair, a blue shirt and three strings of oversized pearls, looks down and her to her left \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Senator Elissa Slotkin released the video</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are literally saying to 1.3 million active duty service members to defy the chain of command, not to follow lawful orders,\" Leavitt added. \"It perhaps is punishable by law.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The six Democratic lawmakers said in a joint statement: \"No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since World War Two, many members of the US military have embraced the \"duty to disobey\" - refusing to carry out an order that is unlawful - and the idea is being discussed more in the civilian realm as Trump's deployments of National Guard troops to US cities face legal challenges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the US military's code of justice, a member of the armed services can refuse to follow \"a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission of a crime\" or one that goes against the US Constitution, which service members swear to uphold when they join the military<b id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leaders in the US House of Representatives said they were working with Capitol Police to adequately protect the lawmakers - and their families - who courted Trump's ire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In regards to Trump's Truth Social posts, Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune said: \"I don't agree with that\", but called the Democrats' message to the military \"unnecessary\" and \"provocative\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Donald Trump has made political violence a feature of his politics,\" the top Democrat in the US Senate, Chuck Schumer, said on X. \"No president has encouraged violence the way this president has.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most Americans consider violence in politics to be on the rise, regardless of their party affiliation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An October Pew Research Center study found 85% of Americans believe politically motivated violence is increasing, a trend echoed in a November Politico and Public First poll.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump, himself, was targeted in two alleged assassination attempts - one at a rally during his presidential campaign last year that left one person dead, as well as Trump and several others injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just this year there have been a number of high-profile incidents, including the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, an arson attack on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home, and the killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Kirk's murder, many conservatives including Trump spoke out against Democrats, arguing they were responsible for the growing political violence in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently said she had received an increased number of threats since a public rift with Trump over some of his policies. Their feud boiled over last week when Trump posted several times about her, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\". Her son also received a death threat, according to local police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More public officials are reporting attempts at swatting - making prank calls to emergency services to deploy a Swat team - in recent months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That includes an Indiana Republican who was the focus of a separate Truth Social attack from the president, over his stance on redistricting in the state. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He must also pay €10,000 to Mr González Amador as compensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trial of García Ortiz fuelled already acrimonious relations between the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and right-wing opposition.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their contrasting positions were underlined by reactions to the conviction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sánchez must apologise to Spaniards, resign and call elections, in that order,\" said Ester Muñoz, spokeswoman for the conservative People's Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government said it did not agree with the ruling but respected it and would proceed with the appointment of a new attorney general.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a number of politicians on the left expressed outrage at what they saw as a politically motivated ruling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health Minister Mónica García, of the Sumar party, said the conviction dealt a \"lethal blow to [the concept of] presumption of innocence\" and threw ordinary Spaniards \"under the bus\" when it came to the rule of law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The complex case dates back to March 2024, when the attorney general's office issued a press release stating that Mr González Amador had requested a plea bargain after being found to have evaded tax payments worth €350,951. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The document corrected mistaken press reports stating that the attorney general's office had proposed the bargain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The source of the incorrect reports was the head of communications of the conservative regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Ms Díaz Ayuso is the partner of Mr González Amador.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr González Amador filed a complaint against the attorney general, claiming his privacy had been breached. The case against García Ortiz also saw him accused of leaking information about the affair to the media. Prosecutors pointed to the attorney general's decision to change his phone as incriminating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there was no direct evidence linking García Ortiz to the leak and several journalists testified during the trial that he had not been the source of their information. Regarding the press statement, the attorney general said he was simply correcting the erroneous reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">García Ortiz can appeal against the ruling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes as a severe blow for the prime minister, who has been under judicial pressure on various fronts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His brother is due to go on trial for influence peddling, his wife is under investigation for her business activities and two former senior figures in the Socialist Party, José Luis Ábalos and Santos Cerdán, are accused of overseeing a massive kickback scheme.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Handover of Ukraine's territory and cut in armed forces</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukrainian-forces-will-withdraw-from-the-part-of-donetsk-oblast-that-they-currently-control,-and-this-withdrawal-zone-will-be-considered-a-neutral-demilitarized-buffer-zone,-internationally-recognized-as-territory-belonging-to-the-russian-federation.-russian-forces-will-not-enter-this-demilitarised-zone.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"the-size-of-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-will-be-limited-to-600,000-personnel.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft also proposes that \"<i id='crimea,-luhansk-and-donetsk-will-be-recognized-as-de-facto-russian,-including-by-the-united-states\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\"</i>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ukraine's future - with EU but not Nato</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-agrees-to-enshrine-in-its-constitution-that-it-will-not-join-nato-and-nato-agrees-to-include-in-its-statutes-a-provision-that-ukraine-will-not-be-admitted-in-the-future.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-is-eligible-for-eu-membership-and-will-get-short-term-preferred-market-access-to-the-european-market-while-this-issue-is-being-evaluated.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a <i id='\"non-nuclear-state\".' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"non-nuclear state\".</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bringing Russia back from isolation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with <i id='\"russia-to-be-re-integrated-into-the-global-economy\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"</i> and invited back into the G8 group of powers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What about Russia's frozen assets?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested<i id='\"in-us-led-efforts-to-rebuild-and-invest-in-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\"</i>, with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rest of those frozen assets would go to a <i id='\"us-russian-investment-vehicle\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"US-Russian investment vehicle\"</i>, under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is not in the plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is this a definitive peace plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Equally US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is the draft a Putin wishlist?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy5g4r9l4dlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">could be the \"basis\" for a peace settlement</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be <i id='\"agreed-upon-in-stages-and-on-a-case-by-case-basis\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"</i> - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a plan for a<i id='\"full-amnesty\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"full amnesty\" </i>for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One point is explicit but even-handed:<i id='\"both-countries-will-agree-to-abolish-all-discriminatory-measures-and-guarantee-the-rights-of-ukrainian-and-russian-media-and-education.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe - <i id='\"equally-between-russia-and-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"equally between Russia and Ukraine\"</i>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio.

with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Popova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Increasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-zaprovadila-sankciyi-proti-visokoposadovciv-derzhav-101253\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sanctions have been imposed on him</a> for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What platforms are affected?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">have recently introduced age checks</a> on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How will the ban be enforced?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c2ce/live/a11eecb0-c5e0-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A circle of young people from the shoulders down holding a smartphones in multicoloured cases\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A recent Australian government study found 96% of children aged 10-15 used social media - and seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content and behaviour</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government is encouraging platforms to use multiple different methods.

As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xgwyywe4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">made headlines</a> for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are there data protection concerns?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How have social media companies responded?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion.

Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epennv98lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new safety rules</a> introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjep23403o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">French parliamentary enquiry</a> recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will children try to get around the ban?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents.

The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial and his death was ruled a suicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids on his various properties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found over 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence in its databases, hard drives and other storage, according to a 2025 memo from the justice department. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While some of the files likely include materials gathered by prosecutors working at federal level and Florida state level to investigate Epstein, the justice department says there is a \"large volume\" of images and videos of victims and other illegal child abuse material. These files would not be released to the public, as the latest legislation passed by Congress allows the justice department to withhold information that identifies victims. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"It's exhausting\" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What has already been released on Epstein?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, thousands of documents belonging to the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was not the first tranche released by the House Oversight Committee since it subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier release, in September, included a birthday book containing a note to Epstein bearing Trump's name, which he has denied writing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In February, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the \"first phase of the declassified Epstein files\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House, but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material already out there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is now poised to change.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happens now that Trump has approved release?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vote in the House of Representatives was forced by a discharge petition getting its critical 218th signature to trigger action on the floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four Republicans and all 214 Democrats in the House signed the petition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20r07dg6kro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The vote</a> to release the files took place on 18 November and the bill passed 427-to-1 in the House.

Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \"terrific guy\". Epstein would later remark: \"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been \"a fan of his\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why are people so interested in Epstein?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Die-hard members of Trump's MAGA movement have long believed officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of them have theorised that a child-molesting cabal has been operating at the highest levels of US society, protected by the state. The theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one of the conspiracy theories pushed by some MAGA influencers, Epstein was an agent of the Israeli government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Trump allies have tried to quell the backlash. Last month, the Republican-controlled House announced an early recess for the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of Epstein-related documents within 30 days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are several unanswered questions about Epstein shared by the wider population too - particularly why he was given such a lenient sentence in Florida, whether he and Maxwell were really acting alone, and how he was allowed to take his own life in prison.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Elections are due early next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Or, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6xqyzzdxgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">statements </a>or <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lq1e1d79lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">interviews</a>, something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A student-led uprising forced toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A student-led uprising toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.isas.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ISAS-Insights-761.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">paper</a> published by the National University of Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/650b87725caa\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">survey</a> by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London.
