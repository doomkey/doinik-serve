Mobile internet outages have been blamed by authorities on Ukrainian drone attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin also addressed Russia's faltering economy, with prices rising, growth on the slide and VAT going up from 20 to 22% on 1 January. One message to the president read: \"Stop the crazy rise in prices on everything!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin regularly uses the end-of-year event to highlight the resilience of the economy and, as Putin spoke, Russia's central bank announced it was lowering interest rates to 16%.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign policy issues were mixed with musings about the motherland, praise for local businesses, fish prices and the importance of looking after veterans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of almost four years of full-scale war in Ukraine was never far away and it was often in the background of many of the questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin again claimed to be \"ready and willing\" to end the war in Ukraine \"peacefully\" but offered little sign of compromise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He repeated his insistence on principles he had outlined in a June 2024 speech, when he demanded that Ukrainian forces leave four regions Russia partially occupies and that Kyiv gives up its efforts to join Nato.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief among Russia's demands is full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, including about 23% of Donetsk region which Russia has not been able to occupy.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin argued Russian forces were making advances across the front line in Ukraine and he ridiculed Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the front line at Kupiansk last week, when the Ukrainian leader was able to refute Russia claims that it had captured the town.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has also demanded new elections in Ukraine to be included in the peace proposals that US President Donald Trump has submitted as part of his efforts to bring the conflict to an end. At his news conference, Putin offered to stop bombing Ukraine when voting took place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's SBU security service said on Friday it had for the first time hit an oil tanker operating as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.  Putin said it would not lead to the result that Kyiv wanted and would not disrupt Russian exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the questions from Russian media or from the public made little attempt to challenge Putin, but two were allowed from Western correspondents, Keir Simmons of US network NBC and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Simmons asked if Putin would feel responsible for the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians if he rejected the Trump peace plan, Putin praised the US president's \"sincere\" efforts to end the war, but said it was the West not Russia that was blocking a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ball is in the hands of our Western opponents,\" he said, \"primarily the leaders of the Kyiv regime, and in this case, first and foremost, their European sponsors.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said a peace deal is closer than ever and, despite Putin's apparent refusal to compromise, the US president has said he hopes \"Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Ukrainian delegation is holding talks in Miami on Friday with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. German, French and British officials are also there, days after they met the US officials in Berlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also expected in Miami over the weekend, according to reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin told the BBC's Russia Editor: \"We are ready to work with you - with the UK and with Europe in general and with the United States, but as equals, with mutual respect to each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to cease these hostilities immediately, provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to cooperate with you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the West of creating an enemy out of Russia. Skating over his decision to mount a full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said: \"You are waging a war against us with the hands of Ukrainian neo-Nazis,\" before repeating his regular diatribe against Ukraine's democratically elected leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is only a few years away from attacking Nato. The Western defensive alliance's chief Mark Rutte said this month that Russia was already escalating a covert campaign and the West had to be prepared for war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many of the questions were benign, including several from children, from a one reporter from Yakutia in north-eastern Siberia highlighted a tenfold increase in energy prices in the past four years. Putin told her that his team would look into alternative sources of energy and \"keep Yakutia in mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Towards the end of the TV marathon, Putin was asked a series of quickfire questions, touching on his views on friendship, religion, the motherland and love at first sight. He said he believed in love at first sight - then added that he himself was in love, without divulging any more details.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes.

Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin returns to my question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, he also suggested he would tighten protest laws to scale back mass demonstrations to encourage \"a summer of calm\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The premier confirmed he would seek to classify the chant \"globalise the intifada\" as hate speech. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two pro-Palestinian protesters were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly shouting slogans involving intifada at a demonstration in central London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Minns, along with the NSW Opposition Leader Kellie Sloane, attended the funeral Matilda, 10, who was the youngest victim of the Bondi shooting. He read out a poem dedicated to the young girl at the event.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prime minister Anthony Albanese has announced <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn09p4kjj4wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a new gun buyback scheme</a> to purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms. Hundreds of thousands of guns will be collected and destroyed, the government predicts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 1,000 lifeguards staged a tribute on Saturday, lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, on the shorelines of Bondi beach. Surf lifesaving teams at other beaches around Australia were photographed performing a similar memorial.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Through the week, Bondi's surf volunteers have been commemorated as some of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxp998rd9ko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">heroes of the shooting</a>. Lifeguard Jackson Doolan was photographed sprinting over from a neighbouring beach during the attack carrying a red medical supply bag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of swimmers and surfers paddled out at Bondi beach yesterday to create a giant circle to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Australia will hold a national day of reflection with the theme \"light over darkness\" marking precisely one week after the attack started with a minute's silence at 6:47 pm (0747 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flags will fly at half-mast and Australians are being asked to light a candle in their windows to honour the victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sixty seconds carved out from the noise of daily life, dedicated to 15 Australians who should be with us today,\" prime minister Albanese told reporters Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will be a moment of pause to reflect and affirm that hatred and violence will never define us as Australians.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi's attack was Australia's worst mass shooting since Port Arthur in 1996, where 35 people were killed and prompted then-prime minister John Howard to introduce strict gun control measures.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Russia has already launched legal action against the clearing house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian President Vladimir Putin accused EU leaders of attempted robbery on Friday and Kirill Dmitriev, his envoy in talks with the US, claimed their failure to agree on using the assets was a \"fatal blow\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Belgium's Bart De Wever said the deal eventually agreed after almost 17 hours of negotiations was a \"victory for Ukraine, a victory for financial stability... and a victory for the EU\". EU ⁠leaders had avoided \"chaos ‍and ‍division\", he added.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine needs an estimated €137bn over the next two years to cover both its military and its public services, and the EU plan is to cover two-thirds of that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The €90bn that the EU will raise on the capital markets as part of the loan deal will be \"backed by EU budget headroom\" - the margin between actual EU contributions by member states in a year and the maximum the European Commission can spend as part of the budget. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to European leaders for the \"significant support that truly strengthens our resilience\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Germany's Friedrich Merz had been a strong supporter of the plan to use Russia's frozen assets. Although the idea has not been dropped, the decision to borrow the money against the EU budget instead is seen as a setback for him. Nevertheless, he declared that it \"sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the compromise deal, while the Czech Republic said it would not guarantee the loan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has opposed handing any more

It said the allegations had \"gravely intensified\" after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other reports by Israeli and Palestinian rights groups have detailed what they say is \"systematic\" abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has denied all the allegations, but rights groups say the fury in the country over the 7 October attacks and the treatment of Israeli hostages in Gaza has created a culture of impunity within the prison services, especially towards detainees who have expressed support for Hamas and its attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, leaked CCTV footage from inside an Israeli military prison showed a Palestinian man from Gaza allegedly being sexually abused by prison guards. That led to a resignation and recriminations at the top of Israel's military and political establishment.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sami al-Saei, 46, now works in a furniture shop, but he used to be a freelance journalist in the town of Tulkarm, in the north of the occupied West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was arrested by Israeli soldiers in January 2024 after working with reporters to arrange interviews with members of Hamas and other armed groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was detained without being charged for 16 months, under a controversial Israeli system known as administrative detention, before being released this summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While he was being held in Megiddo prison in northern Israel, he said, the guards partially stripped him and raped him with a baton on or around 13 March 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he had decided to speak to the BBC about his allegations of sexual abuse, despite the risk of being ostracised in the often conservative Palestinian society in the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There were five or six of them,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They were laughing and enjoying it. The guard asked me: 'Are you enjoying this? We want to play with you, and bring your wife, your sister, your mother, and friends here too,'\" Mr al-Saei continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was hoping to die and be done from that, as the pain was not only caused by the rape, but also from the severe and painful beating.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the assault lasted around 15 to 20 minutes, during which time the guards also squeezed his genitals, causing extreme pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the beatings happened on an almost daily basis, but he was only sexually abused once.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked the Israel Prison Service (IPS) for a response to Mr al-Saei's allegations. It sent a statement, which said: \"We operate in full accordance with the law, while ensuring the safety, welfare, and rights of all inmates under its custody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not aware of the claims described, and to the best of our knowledge, no such incidents have occurred under IPS responsibility.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We also asked the IPS whether an investigation had been launched into the alleged sexual assault and whether any medical records existed.

The assault allegedly happened in July 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five Israeli reservist soldiers were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, they convened a press conference on Israeli television, four of them appearing in black balaclavas to hide their identities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with Channel 14 News, a fifth soldier pulled off his mask to reveal his face, saying he had nothing to hide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All five have denied the charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reservists held the press conference after it emerged that the CCTV footage was leaked by the Israeli military's top lawyer, Military Advocate General Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She resigned in October, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak. She explained that she had wanted to \"counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities\" – a reference to claims from some right-wing politicians that the allegations were fabricated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supporters of the far right have held protests in support of the five accused reservists outside Sde Teiman prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, before her resignation, at a fiery committee hearing at Israel's parliament, Hanoch Milwidsky, a politician from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, was challenged over whether raping a detainee was acceptable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Shut up, shut up,\" he shouted. \"Yes, everything is legitimate if they are Nukhba [elite Hamas fighters who took part in the 7 October attacks]. Everything.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent opinion poll by the widely respected Israel Democracy Institute indicated that the majority of the Israeli public oppose investigating soldiers when they are suspected of having abused Palestinians from Gaza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"Ahmed\" alleges he was abused in an Israeli prison after being found guilty of incitement to terrorism</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed, not his real name, lives in the West Bank with his wife and 11 children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was arrested by soldiers in January 2024 and was found guilty of incitement to terrorism, after making social media posts praising the 7 October Hamas-led attacks, in which around 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, were killed and a further 251 were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 3,000 shekels ($935, £700).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He alleges serious sexual abuse while in Israeli detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The prison guards, three of them, took me into a bathroom and stripped me completely naked before forcing me to the ground,\" Ahmed said in an interview at his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They put my head in the toilet bowl and a massive man, maybe 150kg (330lb), stood on my head, so I was bent over. Then, I heard the voice of someone talking to the prison dog. The dog was named Messi, like the footballer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then detailed how he said the dog was used to sexually humiliate him. He said his trousers and underwear were removed and the dog mounted his back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I could feel its breath... then it jumped on me... I started to scream. The more I screamed, the more they beat me until I almost lost consciousness.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his time in detention, Ahmed also said the guards would beat him on a regular basis, including on his genitals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he was released 12 days after the alleged sexual abuse, after serving his full sentence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Ahmed if there were any medical documents regarding his claims, but he said he did not have any.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We contacted the IPS to ask for a response to Ahmed's allegations, and if an investigation had been launched into his alleged abuse, but we did not receive a reply.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are over 9,000 Palestinian security detainees held in Israeli jails, nearly double the number before the 7 October attacks. Many have never been charged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent report by the UN Committee against Torture unequivocally condemned the 7 October attacks, and also expressed deep concern over Israel's response and the huge loss of human life in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the hostages abducted on 7 October and survivors of the attacks have also made allegations of sexual abuse, rape and torture by Hamas and its allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas has also publicly executed Palestinians in Gaza accused of collaborating with Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also claims of abuse within prisons run by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is in charge in parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control and is a political and military rival of Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has spoken to a former detainee who said PA security officers beat him and used electric shocks on him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted the PA for comment but received no reply.

Trump is the 47th.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vance, meanwhile, is scheduled to speak at the event on Sunday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Turning Point has been credited with helping Republican President Donald Trump expand his coalition of support, leading to his 2024 presidential election victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her announcement ahead of Trump's one-year mark in office signals early jockeying to be his successor ahead of the 2028 election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Kirk gave her opening remarks, the stage at the Phoenix Convention Center in Arizona turned into a political mudslinging contest as tensions within the conservative movement were laid bare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Podcaster Ben Shapiro lobbed attacks at media rivals Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, Megyn Kelly and Steve Bannon, calling them \"fraudsters and grifters\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people who refused to condemn Candace's truly vicious attacks - and some of them are speaking here tonight - are guilty of cowardice,\" Shapiro said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owens, a former Turning Point employee who hosts a popular podcast, has been a thorn in Republicans' side and pushed various conspiracy theories, including baseless suggestions about Charlie Kirk's murder. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It comes at a time when there has been growing speculation about Trump's hold on the Republican party and infighting among factions of the president's supporters about the future of the Maga movement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shapiro also criticised former Fox News host Carlson for interviewing Nick Fuentes, a far-right political commentator and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-69045271\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Holocaust denier</a>, on his podcast in late October, drawing widespread condemnation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Shapiro, Carlson took the stage and shot back at Shapiro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That guy is pompous,\" Carlson said. \"Calls to deplatform at a Charlie Kirk event? That's hilarious.\"  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Charlie Kirk's Turning Point events were known for addressing controversial and divisive topics. Supporters saw it as necessary for free speech. Critics saw it as hate-mongering. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities said Charlie Kirk's alleged assassin - Tyler Robinson - told his romantic partner that he killed Kirk because he \"had enough of his hatred\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Erika Kirk told the Turning Point conference: \"You won't agree with everyone on this stage this weekend. And that's okay. Welcome to America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the assassination, she said, \"we've seen fractures, we've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has recently encountered a series of setbacks within his Republican party, including a public falling out with his former ally Marjorie Taylor Greene and the impending release of the Epstein files, which a majority of Republicans voted for despite Trump's initial discouragement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The four-day America Fest conference was scheduled to continue through the weekend, with Vance and Donald Trump Jr scheduled as guest speakers on Sunday. </p></div></div></body></html>"

The report said no areas in Gaza were now classified as \"in famine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel rejected the original findings of famine by the IPC and has continued to criticise its methodology.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cogat, the Israeli military body which controls Gaza's crossings, said the number of trucks with food aid entering each week went beyond what the UN had determined it needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The report relies on severe gaps in data collection and on sources that do not reflect the full scope of humanitarian assistance,\" the body said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to the Cogat ctiticism, the IPC said publicly available data from UN sources and Cogat had been used for the analysis. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IPC said acute malnutrition was at critical levels in Gaza City and serious in Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the coming months the situation is expected to remain severe but the number of people facing the most severe conditions is predicted to fall to 1,900 by April, according to the report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it added that, if there were renewed hostilities, the entire Strip would be at risk of famine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month that the second phase of the US-brokered peace plan - which would see Israel withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas disarm - was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0r90gkzkezo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">close but key issues still needed to be resolved</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IPC said key drivers of food insecurity included restricted humanitarian access, displacement of more than 730,000 people and the destruction of livelihoods - including more than 96% of crop land in Gaza being destroyed or inaccessible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel imposed a total blockade on aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March this year, which was eased in May, saying it wanted to put pressure on the armed group Hamas to release hostages remaining in Gaza at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of this IPC report, Cogat said the body had not engaged with the US or Israel and its methodology, \"reinforcing a false narrative, driven in part by Hamas-sourced claims\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also denied Israel was preventing winter and medical supplies from entering the territory and that there was a shortage of drinking water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unwra, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said that while, the report stated Gaza was no longer in famine, the situation remained \"critical\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Overall living conditions in the Gaza Strip are still catastrophic, made worse by the winter weather,\" it said in a statement, adding there must be \"sustained, expanded, and consistent humanitarian and commercial access\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

His father Sajid was killed during the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The oldest victim was 89.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

But that didn't matter to the thousands of excited young men and women who had joined the rally organised by right-wing youth group Freedom University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Spearheaded by 24-year-old student Park Joon-young, Freedom University opposes what it sees as a status quo of corrupt, left-wing South Korean governments promising much but delivering little, especially for the nation's youth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in Yoon, they have found an unlikely hero.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the night of 3 December last year, Yoon, whose party had lost its majority in parliament, launched a desperate bid to reverse his fortunes by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98lygwd837o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">declaring martial law</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He ordered troops into the parliament and the national election commission, claiming, without offering any evidence, that the country was under threat from North Korean sympathisers and Chinese spies who were conspiring to steal elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's move was defeated within hours, as furious South Koreans rallied. Thousands of citizens blocked the soldiers, and lawmakers made it inside the National Assembly - some even scaling the walls - to vote down the order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon was impeached soon after and is now on trial, facing the possibility of life in prison.

After watching Yoon's claim of rigged elections - as well as many YouTube videos purporting to show evidence - he joined his first pro-Yoon rally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was also organised by Freedom University. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group mobilised in universities across the country last year to oppose Yoon's impeachment, and has grown quickly, drawing thousands of attendees to their rallies with aggressive social media campaigns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Freedom University's founding philosophies are displayed prominently on banners and picket signs at its rallies: \"Korea for Koreans,\" \"Chinese Communist Party out!\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many are also inspired by the American right's Maga movement. \"Make Korea Great Again\" one sign read, while another said \"We are Charlie Kirk\" - a reference to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxqnkwerj7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Maga influencer</a> who was assassinated in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while the latest polling shows that only around 27% of the Korean public actually agree with their views on Yoon, their rise represents a deeper polarisation that is taking hold in South Korea. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The growth of a movement</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many of Freedom University's supporters, Mr Park says he first turned to the right by rebelling against what he saw as the prevailing influence of the left. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father was the chief of a TV network that is often considered left-leaning, while his mother was an aide to left-wing former president Moon Jae-in.

The government has strongly refuted these. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group also portrays <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7eyg0808xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to thaw ties between Seoul and Beijing</a> as proof that the current government is subservient to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Park says he mostly uses social media platforms popular with young people to spread his message. He started with EveryTime, a Korean online forum exclusive to university students, but has since moved his focus to making short-form videos which have gone viral on Instagram, Threads, and YouTube.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group then gained notoriety in September when it marched through Seoul's Myeongdong neighbourhood, which is frequented by Chinese tourists and home to the Chinese embassy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their videos, where protesters chant anti-Chinese slurs, have gone viral enough that Lee has declared that disinformation and hate speech has reached a dangerous level, and directed his government to criminalise them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Freedom University's message has proved effective in a country where Sinophobia is widespread and the population regularly ranks as one of the world's least favourable towards China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also resonated deeply with Korean youth, many of whom are disenchanted with the state of the economy and their future prospects. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disenchanted youth</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest national survey suggests young South Koreans are the most pessimistic about their country's future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 75% of them believe the economy is in poor shape, compared to their parents. Around 50% of that generation hold a positive view of the economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's economy has grown only 1 to 2% since the pandemic - and with Trump's trade war and growing Chinese competition, young South Koreans are feeling the squeeze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home ownership rates for younger generations are at an all-time low.

And Zamrock was that sound - that sound of new freedom, that sound of boldness,\" the Zambian-born, Botswanan-raised rapper - who has performed at the likes of Glastonbury, Coachella and the Sydney Opera House - told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock - with its heady blend of psychedelic rock and traditional Zambian sounds - rears its head on Can't Hold Us, the first single to be released from Sampa's upcoming album. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fuzz guitars thrust the song forwards, as 32-year-old Sampa, full name Sampa Tembo, defiantly raps: \"They don't have the guts to match my prowess.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And she's not the only contemporary artist who has been digging through Zamrock's dusty crates. In the past few years US hitmakers Travis Scott, Yves Tumour and Tyler, the Creator have sampled tracks from Ngozi Family, Amanaz and WITCH - all popular bands in Zamrock's 1970s heyday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock can also be heard on our screens - HBO superhero series Watchmen and Emmy-winner Ted Lasso have incorporated songs from the genre in their soundtracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is an unexpected resurgence, especially given that in its heyday, Zamrock never really left the African continent. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sampa the Great thinks Zamrock's resurgence will be \"huge\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The movement emerged in the 1970s, in a Zambia recently broken free from its British colonisers. The nation was basking in an economic boom and President Kenneth Kaunda had enforced a \"Zambia first\" policy which, among many other things, meant 95% of the music played by radio stations had to be of Zambian origin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The groundwork was laid for young creatives to forge a bold, distinctly Zambian musical identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were influenced by rock bands like Deep Purple, Grand Funk Railroad, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown,\" says WITCH frontman Emmanuel Chanda, better known as Jagari, after Mick Jagger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we were Africans. We wanted to play like those rock bands but then the African aspect was also calling: 'You can't leave me behind'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 1970s, Zambia's recording studios were rudimentary and there was no established recording industry. Regardless, Zamrock thrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musicians illuminated stages with bell-bottom jeans, platform shoes and colourful headbands. WITCH, an acronym for We Intend To Cause Havoc, lived up to their name, with fans clamouring outside sold-out venues, hoping to watch marathon shows that sometimes lasted from 19:00 to 02:00.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The fact that they mixed traditional music with psychedelic rock in a conservative country... and to be able to do that and be loud about it - it was something very bold to do in the 70s, let alone now,\" says Sampa - who was pleased to recently discover that her uncle, \"Groovy\" George Kunda, was a founding member of WITCH.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for all of its impact, Zamrock could not last. The genre crumbled after roughly a decade, when Zambia was hit with a series of crises. The price of copper, Zambia's main export, plummeted, leading to an economic decline that diminished the ability to tour, record and buy music. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musical piracy also hit Zamrockers, as bootleggers made money by copying and selling their music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And from the 1980s, the country was badly hit by the HIV/Aids crisis, which led to the deaths of many musicians. Five of WITCH's founding members died from Aids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock lay dormant for decades. Its surviving founders returned to civilian life - Jagari went to work in the mines to support his family.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage via Getty Images Tyler, the Creator poses wearing a furry hat, blue blazer, yellow shirt and gold chain.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tyler, the Creator had high praise for Zamrock's Ngozi Family, who he sampled in his 2024 single Noid</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the early 2010s, seemingly out of nowhere, record collectors in the West caught on to the genre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US-based label Now-Again Records played a significant part in Zamrock's revival, sourcing and reissuing albums from some of the genre's biggest names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wasn't sure if it had a market. I was just sure that it was very cool,\" Now-Again label boss Eothen \"Egon\" Alapatt tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I figured: 'If I'm curious about this, there's probably other people who are curious about this'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vinyl enthusiasts rushed to buy original Zamrock records, which only exist in small numbers, and their value naturally spiked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I started getting a lot of requests for original Zamrock records, and I didn't understand why people were so interested,\" says Duncan Sodala, a Zamrock fan and the owner of Time Machine, a record store in Zambia's capital, Lusaka.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Sodala went online and was \"shocked\" to find that records pressed in the 1970s were selling for between $100 (£74) and $1,000 (£740).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011, Now-Again Records released a compilation of WITCH's music. The ensuing buzz led to a reincarnation of the band, featuring Jageri and Patrick Mwondela from WITCH's old days, and a number of younger European musicians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">WITCH have since released two albums, starred in a documentary, played at the iconic Glastonbury Festival and toured outside Africa - something the original band never managed to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like a new lease on life I never expected at my advanced age,\" 74-year-old Jagari says on a call from New Zealand, the final stop on WITCH's 2025 world tour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Munich, there was crowd surfing, which I had never done before.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Jagari is thrilled by a second chance to play Zamrock, new opportunities are a reminder of his sorely missed bandmates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are times that I wish the whole band, the original line-up, was there to showcase what it was like in the beginning,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crowds at WITCH's shows, comprising fans young and old, are proof of Zamrock's fresh appeal.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Redferns/Getty Images Emmanuel 'Jagari' Chanda sings into a microphone on stage, wearing a colourful outfit and hat\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Redferns/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jagari and the new version of WITCH played Glastonbury earlier this year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Zamrockers are also being rediscovered - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/vHmg-xaNJX0?si=U7K4YCzNswrYUM4h&amp;t=704\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tyler</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/vHmg-xaNJX0?si=U7K4YCzNswrYUM4h&amp;t=704\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> the Creator, who sampled the Ngozi Family song 45,000 Volts on his 2024 track Noid, called the band \"incredible\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The whole country was just doing some, really, really good stuff,\" he told popular interviewer Nardwuar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Go-to hip-hop producer Madlib and Mike D of the Beastie Boys have also voiced admiration for the genre, while Third Man Records, the label co-owned by blues-rocker Jack White, has released a recording of live WITCH music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egon believes Zamrock's surprise popularity is down to its exuberance.

The story goes that the mutton galouti kebabs that have defined the city amongst visitors were created to feed an ageing nawab who had lost his teeth. His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theworlds50best.com/discovery/Establishments/India/New-Delhi/Dum-Pukht.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Maroof Culmen A man's hand holds a plate of dessert in Lucknow\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Maroof Culmen</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad.

none more so than for leading gun control advocate Roland Browne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the country's deadliest modern-day mass shooting was unfolding an hour's drive away, Mr Browne was meeting fellow gun control advocates at his home, ahead of a government meeting, to lobby for a ban on the exact type of firearm the Port Arthur gunman was using.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Browne, 66, was again at home in Hobart on Sunday when he received news of the shooting at Bondi, targeting a Jewish event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's just a lot of similarities,\" Mr Browne, who spent childhood summers in Bondi and still has family there, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're both very public places frequented by tourists from around the nation and around the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's sickening and I'm bitterly disappointed in our political system whereby the voices for tighter gun laws and public health aren't listened to until there's a major event like this,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For decades, Australia has stood as a beacon on the world stage for its strict gun laws, he says, taking a similar path to the UK which experienced its own mass shooting in Dunblane, just one month before Port Arthur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even now, Mr Browne remains friends with relatives of some of the 17 victims -

Under new laws introduced in March this year, gun owners can have between five and ten firearms, depending on the type of licence and model of firearm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have confirmed that one of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram who was killed at the scene of the Bondi attack, owned six registered guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Browne wants a cap of one to three guns, depending on the licence category, to be introduced across Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Tom Kenyon, chief executive of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, argues that a cap would be meaningless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Limiting the number of guns wouldn't have made a difference on Sunday,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And it wouldn't have changed the fact that an attack occurred because those two individuals had been radicalised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kenyon argues that people intent on harm, without access to guns, will use other weapons, referencing the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63954860\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2016 Bastille Day massacre in the French city of Nice</a> where 86 people were killed after a man drove a truck into crowds during fireworks celebrations. The attack was claimed by Islamic State (IS).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other alleged Bondi gunman, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was previously investigated over links to IS, according to comments made by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kenyon also says that more guns are found in cities because most people in Australia live in metropolitan areas and travel to other areas to hunt. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tasmania has the most guns per person in Australia</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Australia's current gun laws?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gun control laws in Australia are not uniform across the country, with inconsistent implementation of the rules across states and territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But generally, to apply for a gun licence, you must be over 18, a \"fit and proper person\", pass a training and safety course and give a \"genuine reason\" for having a firearm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The eight accepted reasons include recreational hunting or pest control, target or sport shooting, for work (such as security guards and prison officers), for use in farming or animal welfare and firearms collectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are loopholes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, anyone under 18 was meant to be barred from owning a firearm under the 1996 gun control reforms, but minors in various jurisdictions can have access to a firearm while under supervision, ranging from age 10 in the Northern Territory to 12 in other states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another situation is where a particular type of gun is banned in one state but legal elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the days after the Port Arthur massacre, then-Australian prime ministerJohn Howard galvanised every state and territory to overhaul the country's gun laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 650,000 firearms were voluntarily handed in to authorities and destroyed, as part of a buyback programme.

She too wishes to keep her identity and her late husband's hidden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her husband Anatoliy volunteered to fight in 2022. He was initially refused because of his lack of military experience but he \"kept coming back until they took him\", she says with a faint smile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anatoliy was deployed as a machine-gunner near Bakhmut, one of the bloodiest battles of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said that, after one mission, about 50 guys were killed,\" Maryana recalls. \"He came back different; quiet; distant.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After losing part of his arm, Anatoliy was sent to hospital.

He became a driver in a reconnaissance unit and witnessed some of the most intense battles, including the liberation of Kherson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June 2023, Viktoria received a phone call telling her Andriy had taken his own life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was like the world had collapsed,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His body arrived 10 days later, but she was told she could not see it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An attorney she later hired found inconsistencies in the investigation into his death. The photos from the scene made her doubt the official version of her husband's death. The Ukrainian military has since agreed to reopen the investigation, recognising failures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now she is fighting to re-open the case: \"I'm fighting for his name.
