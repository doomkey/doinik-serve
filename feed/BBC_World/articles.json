It is unclear whether this has taken place. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A representative from the Hengaw Organization for Human Rights also told the BBC that they had \"never witnessed a case move so quickly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Trump said of potential executions: \"If they hang them, you're going to see some things... We will take very strong action if they do such a thing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soltani's relative told BBC Persian that an Iranian court had issued a death sentence \"in an extremely rapid process, within just two days\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were \"deeply concerned that he could be executed without any prior notice\", given that contact with Iran has been affected by the internet shutdown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soltani's detention demonstrated that the Iranian government was trying \"to control the population, to not allow any more protests to happen\", Hengaw representative Awyar Shekhi told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soltani's sister - who is a lawyer - tried to intervene in his case but was told by authorities there was nothing to pursue, Shekhi added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prisoners sentenced to death in Iran are typically granted final moments with loved ones. While the Iranian authorities have told the family they will allow a meeting with Erfan before his execution, Shekhi said, he hasn't been allowed any contact with his family since his arrest.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Hengaw Organization for Human Rights/X A man with dark hair, a beard and a pierced ear looks at the camera as snow falls around him.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hengaw Organization for Human Rights/X</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Erfan Soltani, 26, was detained on Thursday last week</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An Iranian official told Reuters that 2,000 people had been killed, but that \"terrorists\" were to blame. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump earlier said he planned to attend a meeting at the White House on Tuesday night to discuss the situation in Iran, pledging to get \"accurate numbers\" on the death toll from the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain,\" Trump told reporters while returning to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once he has the numbers, he said, \"we'll act accordingly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) said that it had so far confirmed the killing of 2,403 protesters, as well as 12 children, despite an internet blackout. Nearly 150 people affiliated with the government have also been killed, the group said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">State-linked Iranian news agency Fars reported that funerals were held in Tehran on Wednesday for more than 100 members of the security forces and others they described as \"martyrs\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings, and urged people to \"keep protesting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!,\" he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, \"Make Iran Great Again\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's government has responded by accusing the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", warning that \"this playbook has failed before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demonstrations escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow,\" an activist told BBC Persian on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan.

We are short of supplies, short of blood.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other doctors at \"two to three hospitals\" had also said they had treated hundreds of injured or dead people, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An Iranian living in Rasht, near the Caspian Sea coast, described the city as unrecognisable. \"Everywhere is burnt with fire,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN human rights chief Volker Türk urged Iranian authorities to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters immediately, his office said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the labelling of protesters as \"terrorists\" to justify violence was unacceptable and that it was \"extremely worrying\" to see statements from Iranian officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited trials.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that those involved in the unrest would be \"dealt with seriously and severely\". And prosecutors have said some will be charged with \"enmity against God\", a national security offence that carries the death penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Türk also demanded that Iranian authorities restore full access to the internet and other communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some international calls from Iran went through on Tuesday, but the internet shutdown has now passed 132 hours, according to monitor NetBlocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person living near Tehran with access via the Starlink satellite service told BBC Persian that there were \"checkpoints in every block\", where cars and the phones of their occupants were being inspected by security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New videos of protests in recent days have also emerged, with BBC Persian verifying those filmed in the central city of Arak and the western cities of Tabriz, Urmia and Khorramabad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the footage from Khorramabad, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTdYTL8k275/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">gunfire can be heard during clashes between security forces and protesters, some of whom are throwing stones</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protesters chant slogans \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei - and \"Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace\" - referring to the late monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution and whose son Reza lives in exile.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The US Vice-President, JD Vance, is hosting the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers, as well as their US counterpart, Marco Rubio, in the White House on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The focus of the talks: the future of the world's biggest island, Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a large digital news ticker tape running above the snow-covered shopping mall in the island's capital, Nuuk. You don't have to speak Greenlandic to understand the words \"Trump\", \"Greenland\" and \"sovereignty\" that appear over and over again, in stark red letters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump says he wants this territory and he'll take it \"the easy way or the hard way\". Ahead of Wednesday's talks, he said the US needed Greenland for national security, and Nato \"should be leading the way for us to get it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After his recent controversial military action in Venezuela, people in Greenland are taking him at his word.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ebd3/live/1ffd51a0-f0fe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters US Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance tour the US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, wearing large coats.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">JD and Usha Vance toured a US military base in Greenland in March, 2025.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The anxious countdown to the Washington meeting has been going on for days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Passers-by tell me it feels like years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would like to encourage (Donald Trump) to use both his ears wisely, to listen more and to speak less. We are not for sale. Our country is not for sale,\" Amelie Zeeb said, removing her chunky mittens, traditionally made here with sealskin and known as  pualuuk, in order to wave her hands for emphasis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My hope is for our country to be independent and well-managed and not be bought,\" said Inuit writer and musician, Sivnîssoq Rask.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Maria, with her seven-week-old baby, wrapped snugly inside her winter coat, told me, \"I worry for the future of my young family. We don't want all this attention here!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But international attention on Greenland is not going to disappear anytime soon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far more hangs in the balance than the fate of this island alone.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tussle over Greenland pits Nato nations Denmark and the US against one another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the US takes control of the island by force, that will be the end of the transatlantic defence alliance that Europe has relied on for security for decades.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It will also be another damaging blow to US-European relations, already badly bruised since Donald Trump's return to the White House. And remember: Europe's leaders are desperate to keep the Trump administration onside, to back a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The potential ramifications of a fallout over Greenland are huge – but it is unclear how Washington intends to handle Wednesday's meeting. Will the spirit be one of compromise or confrontation?</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump insists he needs Greenland for national security. If the US doesn't take Greenland, then China or Russia will, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mindful of this, major European powers, which have vocally supported Danish sovereignty over Greenland, have also been scrambling to come up with military proposals to boost Nato's presence around the island and in the Arctic more broadly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK and Germany have taken the lead here, I'm told, although France on Wednesday announced it would be opening a consulate in Greenland early next month. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described it as \"a political signal\" to be more present in Greenland, \"this territory of the Kingdom of Denmark\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We share the US concerns that this part of Denmark needs better protection,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday. \" We simply want to improve Greenland's security situation together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of the German Reservists Association, Patrick Sensburg, has called for at least one European brigade to be stationed in Greenland as soon as possible. He stressed that Germany would \"bear special responsibility in the endeavor\", and pointed out that the German army would gain strategic advantages by training soldiers in the challenging Arctic conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The British government is also in talks with European allies regarding the possible deployment of military forces to Greenland, particularly in response to perceived threats from Russia and China.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What has Nato suggested in terms of security in the Arctic?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Talks are at a preliminary stage. Troop numbers have not been defined but the discussions already include the possible deployment of soldiers, warships, aircraft, submarines and anti-drone capabilities in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One concrete suggestion is to form a maritime Nato \"Arctic Sentry\", mirroring the \"Baltic Sentry\" set up by alliance in the Baltic Sea after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seabed of both the Baltic and the Arctic are busy with underwater infrastructure, such as energy pipelines and internet cables, critical for communications and billions of dollars worth of financial transactions daily. All vulnerable to hybrid attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot more can be done in the Arctic,\" Oana Lungescu told me. Until 2023 she was Nato's longest-serving Nato spokesperson. She's now a Distinguished Fellow with the defence and security think-tank RUSI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't envisage that the UK or Germany will send a significant number of troops to Greenland, but they could hold more exercises in the region or expand existing ones. The UK and other Nato allies have already started deploying maritime assets for a big biannual Norwegian-led exercise in the High North, called Cold Response. The Arctic became a strategic priority for Nato after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But more needs to be done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In advance of the arrival of more troops in Greenland, Denmark sent a contingent of military personnel to the island on Wednesday \"to prepare for their arrival\", according to Danish TV. This, just a few hours before the meeting in Washington was supposed to start.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland sits between the US and Canada on one side and Russia and Europe on the other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington first got a real taste of Greenland's strategic value during the Second World War. The US occupied the island to stop it being taken by Nazi Germany after its invasion of Denmark. The US tried to buy Greenland after the war but Copenhagen refused. Not long after, the two countries became founding members of Nato and in 1951 they signed a defence agreement, still valid today, allowing the United States to keep its military bases on Greenland and to bring as many troops to the island as it wished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is on the shortest route between continental US and Russia, which makes it key for missile defence. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US greatly reduced its presence here, keeping only one military base - Pituffik Space Base - one of Washington's most important radar stations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Exterior shot of the US military Pituffik military base in Greenland \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coastline here is particularly important. There is a maritime choke-point in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK gap - that's viewed as crucial to keep an eye on Russian and Chinese ships, and especially submarines moving between the Arctic and Atlantic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had asked Denmark to boost its surveillance capacity. Copenhagen recently pledged $4bn for Greenland security though the Trump administration has been dismissive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Nato proposals for a bigger, better Arctic presence be enough for the Trump administration?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Julianne Smith was the US ambassador to Nato until President Trump's re-election; she is now the president of Clarion Strategies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This week's meeting is absolutely critical,\" she told me. \"I think it will be a turning point one way or another. The representatives from Denmark and Greenland are coming prepared. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are taking this moment very seriously, but the real question is whether any of these proposals will actually satisfy a White House that seems more determined and interested in expanding US territory than actually addressing the security of Greenland itself.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is this actually about security?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If security was really all that Donald Trump was concerned about, then the Pacific High North is a far more sensitive area of the Arctic for the US than Greenland, argues Ian Lesser, a Distinguished Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's where Russian and US presence and interests come into close contact, he told me. In fact, there are two small islands in the middle of the Bering Strait, where you could potentially walk from the United States to Russia in midwinter. Big Diomede is in Russia, and Little Diomede is in the US state of Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But tensions have risen here since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The waters of the Bering Strait are key to Russia for the transit of strategic nuclear assets and American and Canadian fighter jets have repeatedly been forced to scramble to intercept Russian military planes off the Arctic coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ian Lesser believes Donald Trump's focus on Greenland, rather than Alaska, suggests more of an interest in economic security, rather than security in the traditional sense. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he says, both could be dealt with without touching Danish or Greenlandic sovereignty: Nato could help boost security and defence, and the US could negotiate investment rights in Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is rich in natural resources, including rare earths and minerals that the US and every other global power crave because of their importance to high-tech industries, including advanced defence technologies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington also has its eye on the potential for new, potentially lucrative shipping routes opening up as the Arctic ice melts.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen standing side-by-side at two separate lecterns with microphones during a press conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen speaking at a press conference on 13 January in Copenhagen. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's hard to see how Donald Trump's appetite for territorial expansionism can leave room for negotiation on Wednesday.  These were his words at the beginning of the week:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're talking about acquiring not leasing.... We have bases on Greenland. I could put a lot of soldiers if I want but you need more than that. You need ownership. You really need title.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is a territory of Denmark and therefore politically European, but geographically, it is part of North America. The island is closer to Washington than Copenhagen and Donald Trump seems to have a keen interest in making America great-er in terms of size and dominance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most Greenlanders say they want to be independent of Denmark but even more of them (85% in polls) reject the idea of being American.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of Wednesday's meeting in Washington, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said his country faced a geopolitical crisis, \"and if we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, then we choose Denmark.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But however the meeting with the US vice president and secretary of state goes on Wednesday, Donald Trump is the Joker in the pack of cards, says Sara Olvig of Greenland's Centre for Foreign and Security policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What will happen will come down to the president,\" she told me. \"And he's very unpredictable.

Had she been convicted, she could have faced a jail term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ferragni, 38, told reporters the judgment marked \"the end of a nightmare that lasted two years\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The scandal - dubbed \"pandorogate\" - started with the sale of pink special edition Christmas cakes in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumers were led to believe that sales of the pandoro would go towards raising funds for a children's hospital in Turin. But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all moved,\" Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. \"The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He allegedly said he meant his remarks in reference to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Russia, he said, was testing Poland's defences and testing Nato's solidarity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Polish president then thanked Britain for sending over <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7752w1ygo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">RAF Typhoon jets to help defend his borders</a>. He said Poland had been in a state of hybrid war with Russia since 2021, as it dealt with drones and disinformation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Russian grey zone activity showed \"we are living in dangerous times\", he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was asked about his friendship with Donald Trump, particularly in the light of the US president's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78vj5n7jg3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">threats to take over \"by any means\" the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland</a>, something which has rattled Europe and which threatens to rupture the 77-year old Nato alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, he insisted, despite recent statements by US officials to the contrary, was still the guarantor of security in Europe. What Donald Trump was doing on behalf of the Europeans, he said, \"deserved support and great respect\". President Nawrocki said he could see Europe \"detaching\" itself from the United States and said this was good neither for the economic security nor the military security of the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That still left the awkward question of Greenland. This discussion, he said, should remain a matter between the Danish prime minister and President Trump. Karol Nawrocki was convinced that this question would be resolved through Nato and through dialogue between Denmark and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But President Nawrocki also used this interview to criticise European leaders for, as he put it, being \"involved in not so important things, in ideological issues such as green deal for instance, climate policy, migration issues\". Europe, he said, was not building its resilience and security over the years, whereas Poland was now allocating close to 5% of its GDP to defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Britain, though, he had some warm words. Relations between Poland and the UK were \"extremely important\" and today around one million Poles lived in the UK. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would like to express my very deep appreciation for the British soldiers who are stationed in Poland... taking responsibility for Nato's Eastern flank,\" he said.

No, no, no - don't waste our time,\" Kisakyamukama was heard saying. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets.

One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£21).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cvg5deg250yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">co-host the opening ceremony</a> along with track and field events in 2028. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://next.tickets.la28.org/?c=web&amp;e=la28q00260110&amp;ver=javascript-4.4.3&amp;cver=1768287843&amp;man=WEB%20%2F%20LA28-Q0&amp;enqueuetoken=eyJ0eXAiOiJRVDEiLCJlbmMiOiJBRVMyNTYiLCJpc3MiOjE3NjgzNjExODQ3NDMsInRpIjoiNjY5MzVlNmEtMGMxYi00YTI3LTgyZjItN2JmZWNhNzgxMzI3IiwiYyI6IndlYiIsImUiOiJsYTI4cTAwMjYwMTEwIiwiaXAiOiIxMDQuNTQuMzMuNzcifQ.K3aMsWa6tHSlTKLSduLAxQ.y-3s_XYXQ2nAOtSaQUm0TUuGV5x5fyBANy5nmx4Uc4Q&amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Ftickets.la28.org%2F&amp;kupver=akamai-4.4.3\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Registration for tickets</a> will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, the son of a jailed opposition figure warned US President Donald Trump to \"not be fooled\" by Venezuela's promises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the government said more than 100 such prisoners had already been released - a figure that exceeds the number confirmed by rights groups or the UN, but which still represents only a fraction of the total number believed to be held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, the UN reiterated its longstanding concerns over the country's use of \"widespread and systematic use of arbitrary detention as a tool of repression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives of those still behind bars continue to express frustration and anxiety, and many of them have kept vigil outside the notorious El Helicoide prison in the capital Caracas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday's move to release detainees with foreign citizenship appears to signal an effort by Rodríguez to win the favour of the international community, and especially the US, despite the structures that existed during the rule of Maduro remaining in place after he was seized.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The release of the US citizens comes ahead of a visit to the White House on Thursday by María Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner who has made her own efforts to win over Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least three Americans had been freed as of Tuesday night, a source told the New York Times. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Senator Rick Scott, a Republican who represents Florida, thanked Trump for pushing for the release of the prisoners, saying they had been \"held captive by Maduro's evil regime in Venezuela for too long\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Scott added in a social media post: \"Every single prisoner still held under Delcy Rodríguez should be released ASAP.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend, Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that the process of freeing detainees in Venezuela had begun \"in a BIG WAY\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he cancelled a second wave of airstrikes on Venezuela once he learned Caracas was cooperating with the release of prisoners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Human rights groups and political activists have long accused the government of using detentions to muzzle its critics. Officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, where Maduro claimed victory despite opponents disputing the results.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That vote lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous releases of Americans held in Venezuela have been negotiated through swap deals. Relatives of US citizens detained in the country have said that their loved ones have sometimes been detained while on personal travel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Americans are currently warned by their government against travelling to the South American country due to the risk of wrongful detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those said to still be imprisoned in Venezuela is 28-year-old James Luckey-Lange, whose aunt recently told the Washington Post that he \"has no political ties to Venezuela at all\" and was \"just a kid that likes to travel\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

She was 86 years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,\" said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she \"was not frightened, but disappointed and angry\" because she knew she \"was sitting in the right seat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later in life, she became a nurse in New York.

Chinese customers must also show \"sufficient security procedures\" and cannot use the chips for military uses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the \"politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,\" he said. \"This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">designed to bolster China's tech industry</a>, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxz29pe1v0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">lobbied Washington</a> to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit  Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's \"unique\" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily. </p></div></div></body></html>"

The train is not going anywhere but it is providing a vital service for dozens of people who have been left without power and basics like running water or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are Ukraine's \"Invincibility Trains\", designed to boost public morale and provide some comfort as a bitter winter coincides with intensifying Russian attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one of the carriages, Alina sits watching her infant son Taras playing with toys provided by international charities who help run the service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's winter and it's rather cold outside,\" says Alina which is something of an understatement. With the effect of the wind-chill, temperatures this week in Kyiv have hit -19C. It is bitterly cold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I live in a new building on the 17th floor, but we have no elevator, no electricity and no water supply,\" says Alina. As Taras plays with his toys, she says it is also a relatively safe and comfortable place for her daughter to meet friends.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also a welcome distraction for Alina, whose husband works all day in a factory, but she suddenly starts to stutter and weep as she tells me about her 54-year-old father who was killed at the front two years ago in a summer offensive near Bakhmut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As she regathers her composure, Alina says she will definitely come back here and welcomes the relief the train brings from the weather and the nightly Russian strikes.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">For Alina and Taras, the train is a distraction from the hardship of daily life </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of deliberately exploiting the bitter winter to target power stations, energy storage facilities and other critical infrastructure. Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had electricity today for something like four minutes,\" Ihor tells me. \"All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine,\" says Yulia somewhat ironically. \"With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ihor and Yulia say they will leave Kyiv temporarily because of the energy crisis</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The energy crisis is not the only reason to move. Just across the courtyard from their new, temporary home, a recent Russian drone strike hit an apartment block, badly damaging several homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's problems are exacerbated by the fact it has borne so many Russian airstrikes against homes and critical infrastructure installations and, as home to more than three million people, the power shortages impact many people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent Russian attacks against energy installations in the capital and other big cities have had a cumulative effect that is much worse than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Klitschko said strikes on Monday night had caused the worst electrical outage the city had yet seen, and on Tuesday more than 500 residential buildings were still without power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst,\" Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every time it's harder to recover. Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Engineers are working to locate and repair damaged cables</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take years and years. We are currently working literally in emergency modes,\" says Andrii Sobko from DTEK Grids repair crew. \"The equipment is literally operating at its critical parameters so that at least the residents have light.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the war drags on, it's hard to find anyone in Ukraine who has not been directly impacted by the conflict.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kyiv is enduring its fourth winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stanislav or \"Stas\" has also come down to the Invincibility Train to get warm, meet friends and get some power for his phone. The eleven-year-old says his home is very cold and there'd recently been no power in the family's apartment for 36 hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recalls with clarity the opening day of the war almost four years ago when he could see bright flashes in the sky - a \"bright orb\" - as Russia launched its attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These days it is the threat of Russian drones that keeps him awake at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I hear something flying it's really scary, because you don't know if it will explode now, or if it will fly on and you survive.\"  As we perch on the top bunk of the carriage where he is sitting with another friend, Stas is frank about the impact of the war on his generation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I forget the times when there was no war, I don't remember those moments – life is difficult,\" says Stas, his smile wide and demeanour remarkably bubbly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are all kinds of people seeking warmth, comfort or company on the train. But my next conversation with an elderly lady, who says her discomfort is nothing compared with what soldiers on the front are enduring, is abruptly cut short as the familiar high-pitched sound of an air raid alert rings out on our phones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conductor orders everyone off the train and directs them to a shelter, about a kilometre away. Most head home instead, to the cold and their interrupted power supplies but all - including Stas and Alina - say they'll be back tomorrow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everyone in Kyiv is putting a brave face on things. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This extraordinarily cold winter, even by Ukrainian standards, will not last for much more than a couple of months and the energy crisis will ease. What most people fear is that, despite some optimism at the end of last year, there is no end in sight to the war itself and the inevitable loss of life.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-firle-davies-and-mariana-matviechuk.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Firle Davies and Mariana Matviechuk.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"West Asia News Agency via Reuters A street scene at night showing protesters gathering around parked cars. Smoke can be seen and there are some fires near the crowd.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">West Asia News Agency via Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Iran's judiciary chief has vowed \"swift and harsh\" punishment for \"rioters\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trade will be on the agenda, along with agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. Beijing's foreign ministry said the two countries have \"shared interests\" and should work to \"increase people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Carney meets the Premier of China, Li Qiang, as well as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, the prime minister is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping one-on-one, after the pair met last year on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This official visit is a significant step in the rapprochement after Canada-China relations hit a low in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US warrant on fraud charges related to Iran sanctions violations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The detention in Canada of the executive of a Chinese telecom giant angered Beijing, and China subsequently arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All three were released in 2021 after Meng cut a deal with US prosecutors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has been accused of meddling in Canada's politics, though a public inquiry on foreign interference found its impact in recent federal elections to be minimal. China has repeatedly denied allegations of foreign meddling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have struggled to forge meaningful ties in the past. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng#a2_1_1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Ottawa views China as \"an increasingly disruptive global power\" </a> that \"increasingly disregards\" international rules and norms, though it recognises China's size and influence make some cooperation necessary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Carney government does not see this upcoming visit as a deviation from that view, senior Canadian government officials told reporters this week. But they added that Canada cannot achieve its objective of reducing economic reliance on the US without increasing trade with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney is said to be approaching talks with an eye on increasing collaboration in areas of mutual interest like energy and climate, and putting guardrails on areas where the two countries clash, like defence and critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we are approaching the relationship now with the realism that we haven't seen for decades,\" Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson added that it could result in a \"healthier relationship if both sides understand where they're coming from and what the red lines are\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has already proven to be a careful line to walk. Ahead of Carney's visit, two Liberal MPs cut a sponsored trip to Taiwan short, telling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberal-mps-trip-taiwan-carney-china/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the Globe and Mail newspaper </a>that while Canada's position on Taiwan \"has not changed\", the trip ended early to \"avoid confusion with its foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of Canada's main objectives during this trip is to ease Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola that have hurt farmers in the country's prairie provinces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China last year imposed the agriculture tariffs in a move widely seen as retaliation for Canadian levies on Chinese electric vehicles announced in 2024, mirroring similar levies by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an editorial this week, state-run newspaper Global Times pointed to frustration expressed by Canadian farmers, suggesting \"perhaps this was the heavy price (Canada) paid for blindly following the US\". China has made it clear it wants the tariffs on EVs lifted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For China, Canada is seen as an important trading partner, with trade between the two countries valued at around $118bn in 2024. But crucially for Beijing, if President Xi manages to make a deal with Carney, it would give China more influence in a country that is on America's doorstep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Global Times op-ed called on Ottawa to set a foreign policy path separate from that of the US and to exercise \"strategic autonomy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One big unknown about this visit is how the US would react to any deals struck between Canada and China. Canada's economy has been hit by US tariffs, especially those on its steel, aluminium and automotive sectors. Talks to ease those levies remain on pause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada will soon, however, be engaged in consequential talks on renewing a long-standing North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico that has shielded it from the bulk of Trump's sweeping tariffs. That review is set to be completed later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson, the former diplomat, said it is likely that the Americans are watching the Canada-China relationship \"very closely\", and that Canada is keeping the US \"well informed\" of its intentions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"At the end of the day, there's Canadian interests that we're pursuing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-jessica-murphy-in-toronto.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With additional reporting from Jessica Murphy in Toronto. </i></p></div></div></body></html>"

According to Indian law, she should have been produced before a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) - a three-member bench that deals with matters concerning children in conflict with the law - within 24 hours of her arrest. But this was not done, Yamina Rizvi, a lawyer who took over Pooja's case in 2024, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs, which comprise of a principal magistrate and two social workers, decide if a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult in case of heinous crimes - a provision <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35161193\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">introduced</a> in India's Juvenile Justice law after the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20765320\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2012 Delhi gang rape case</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But instead of appearing before a JJB, Pooja was lodged in a prison for six years while her case was heard in an adult court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"JJBs are also required to make regular visits to prisons to check if minors have been lodged there. But not a single check was conducted while Pooja was in prison,\" Rizvi alleges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Pooja's case was finally transferred to a JJB, which found that she was indeed a minor at the time of the alleged crime. She was released on time served as the maximum sentence for a juvenile is three years and Pooja had already spent six years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Pooja is one of thousands of children who have been let down by the juvenile justice system,\" Rizvi says.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been nearly four decades since India passed its first comprehensive legislation to deal with children in conflict with the law - the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. It has been amended several times since then to strengthen its provisions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law aims to protect children and create opportunities for reform so that they can reintegrate into society and live meaningful lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts who work with children say that there is a long way to go before the system can properly implement the ideals the law preaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strength of India's juvenile justice system depends heavily on the health of its JJBs - quasi-judicial panels tasked with ensuring that a child's rights are protected even as they face the legal consequences of their actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs, established in 2000, don't function in isolation but are the fulcrum of a network comprising child-friendly services including sensitised police units, legal aid services and rehabilitation centres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But research shows that all is not well with these pivotal panels. For one, getting information about them is difficult as there is no single government portal that tracks and publicly shares data related to them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Data shared in November by the India Justice Report (IJR) - a report created by civil society organisations to track the effectiveness of India's justice system - shows that as of 2023, more than half the cases before 362 JJBs were pending hearing. The report doesn't cover all of India's JJBs as it is based on answers from states that responded to a set of questions sent by IJR through the Right to Information Act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the report, India's  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indiajusticereport.org/files/IJR_JJ%202025_Main%20Report_.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">745 districts have 707 JJBs</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report also found that one in four JJBs lacked a full bench, even though the law mandates that every district should have at least one fully-staffed JJB.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Protesters hold posters and placards demanding the death sentence for the convicts in the Delhi gang rape case on September 13, 2013 in New Delhi, India.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Massive protests sparked by the 2012 Delhi gang rape led to a change in India's juvenile justice law</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maja Daruwala, editor at IJR, says that the dearth of accurate data indicates poor oversight and creates a lack of accountability, which in turn seriously impacts the quality of care and rehabilitation opportunities juveniles receive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fr Antony Sebastian, founder of Echo, an NGO working for the welfare of juveniles, says that in the absence of JJBs, children lose not just the protection guaranteed to them by law, but also the chance to reform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These children largely come from poor backgrounds and dysfunctional families, and they grow up witnessing violence and scarcity. When the police beat them and dump them in jails, they're revictimised all over again,\" says Fr Sebastian, a former principal magistrate on two separate JJBs in Bengaluru city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For minors not sent to jail, there isn't much scope for reformation in child care institutions (facilities that house children in conflict with the law), says Deeksha Gujral, programme director at iProbono, which offers legal aid to vulnerable people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs can send children accused of crimes to observation homes, while those found to have committed an offence are placed in special homes. A separate facility, called a 'place of safety', houses children aged 16-18 years who are accused or found guilty of committing heinous offences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs are mandated to inspect these facilities every month to ensure they meet the standards prescribed by law. However, many children's rights advocates say that regular checks seldom happen and even if they do, they're conducted in a superficial manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gujral, who has visited several observation and special homes in the course of her work, says that many of them are overcrowded, and lack counsellors or meaningful recreational, educational and vocational facilities. Additionally, while there are separate facilities for boys and girls, the mandated age-based segregation within these facilities is not always adhered to.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Echo/Fr Antony Sebastian A photo of an expansive building that is the Echo special home in Bengaluru city.
