His face is stern. He is wearing a black jacket and shirt. The Ukrainian flag - in blue and yellow - is displayed on the wall behind him.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has welcomed \"important steps\" made during peace talks with the US in Geneva - but warned the \"main problem\" remained Vladimir Putin's demand for legal recognition of Russian-occupied territories in eastern Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After US and Ukrainian officials convened in Switzerland on Sunday to discuss ending the war with Russia, officials from both sides reported \"progress\" and an intention to continue working. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, no details have emerged on how to bridge the considerable divide between Moscow and Kyiv over territorial issues and security guarantees for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is now thought that Zelensky and US President Donald Trump will meet to discuss the more contentious points, although no timeline has been given.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The question of territorial integrity in particular is a key point of divergence between Russia and Ukraine. Zelensky has repeatedly said Moscow should not be rewarded for its aggression with land it seized by force, and that doing so would create a dangerous precedent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the end of the talks in Geneva Trump suggested on social media that \"something good just may be happening\", but with the caveat: \"Don't believe it until you see it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian representatives did not take part in the meeting in Switzerland and the Kremlin said it hadn't received any information on the outcome of the discussions. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Moscow was aware that \"adjustments\" were made to the plan that had initially been welcomed by Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That 28-point peace proposal was drafted by US and Russian officials in October and<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> presented to Ukraine last week</a>. Several of its elements seemed heavily geared towards Moscow's longstanding demands, sparking consternation in Kyiv and its European allies. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Comments by Trump which suggested Ukraine had until Thursday to accept the deal or face serious cuts in US support contributed to creating a sense of urgency across Europe and talks between Ukraine and US officials were hastily convened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By Sunday evening US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a \"tremendous\" amount of progress had been made at the talks. \"I honestly believe we'll get there,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some European leaders have been more cautious. \"I am not sure if we are closer to peace,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said discussions would be a \"lengthy, long-lasting process\" and that he did not expect any breakthroughs this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europeans were left scrambling for a seat at the table last week, after they were seemingly caught unawares when the US draft peace plan was presented. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A counter-proposal - reportedly drafted by Britain, France and Germany - excluded any recognition of Russian-held regions, raised Ukraine's allowed army size and left the door open to Ukraine joining Nato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio said he was not aware of the plan and on Monday Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov rubbished it as \"completely unconstructive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">28-point plan presented last week</a> would have Ukrainian forces withdraw from the part of Donetsk they currently control. That area would become a neutral demilitarised buffer zone \"internationally recognised as territory belonging to the Russian Federation\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This arrangement too would be difficult to accept for Ukraine. Kyiv and its European partners are wary of any settlement which jeopardises the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty - and Zelensky has repeatedly warned that giving up the Donbas would leave Ukraine vulnerable to Russian attacks in the future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key Russian demand is for Ukraine to never become part of Nato. But Kyiv sees membership of the alliance as the only way to protect itself from future attacks - and joining Nato is enshrined in the Ukrainian constitution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite last week's frenzied diplomacy the next steps in the process are unclear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The expectation is that Zelensky will soon personally speak to Trump, after which a new draft peace plan will be eventually presented to Moscow. There were no plans for a meeting this week between Russian and US negotiators, the Kremlin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there was still work to do for a \"just and lasting peace\" in Ukraine. A virtual \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9vygkzkkrvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">coalition of the willing</a>\" meeting will take place on Tuesday to discuss developments, he added.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belgium is bracing for widespread disruption across sectors including public transport and schools this week as unions hold a three-day national strike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The action was called in response to Prime Minister Bart De Wever's attempts to shrink Belgium's debt by changing labour laws and reforming unemployment benefits and pensions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teachers, medical staff and rubbish collectors will all be joining the rolling industrial action which is set to end in a general strike on Wednesday.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eurostar is among organisations warning of potential disruption, while the two main airports have advised customers that all departure flights will be cancelled on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country had already been hit by several strikes since de Wever, a Flemish nationalist, came to office in February at the head of a centre-right coalition government aiming to cut the budget deficit.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early on Monday, his government reached a budget agreement which he said was the only way to \"guarantee the sustainability\" of Belgium's welfare state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's budget deficit stood at 4.5% of GDP at the end of last year with debt at 104.7% of GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU budget rules stipulate that member states should keep their budget deficit below 3% and debt beneath 60% to maintain sound public finances.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week's industrial action is meant to unfold in three stages, AFP news agency notes: </p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Trains and other public transport went on strike on Monday, with national railroad company SNCB expecting to run one or two out of three trains, and several Eurostar services linking Brussels to Paris cancelled</li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">On Tuesday, public services such as schools, creches and hospitals join in</li></ul><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">On Wednesday a full general strike covers all categories including the two main airports, Bruxelles-Zaventem and Charleroi.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warning of the effect of the strike action in Belgium, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.eurostar.com/uk-en/travel-info/travel-updates\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Eurostar reported that some of its other international services had suffered delays </a>as a result.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defending the action, general workers union FGTB said a demonstration in Brussels two weeks ago had been met with \"total silence\" from the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fair pensions is a core issue cited by the unions while other demands include a fair wealth tax, a tax on digital activities for tech giants and the transparent screening of subsidies to companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A day of action against violence against women separately took place on Sunday which the FGTB said formed part of the current action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bruxelles-Zaventem airport has said it expects \"major disruptions\" to operations on Wednesday with all departure flights cancelled and some cancellations also possible for incoming flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The airport said that staff from their security and handling service provider were expected to be participating in the national industrial action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Charleroi airport has similarly said it will not be able to operate either scheduled departures or arrivals on the day of the general strike - as it also warned passengers of potential disruption on public service networks throughout the strike period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The City of Brussels has warned of \"disrupted services\" on its public transport links throughout the three days of action while transport company, De Lijn, which operates in Flanders has advised there will be \"fewer bus and tram services\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours. And then transfer to a bus for the final leg.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36e7/live/77279ee0-c61a-11f0-934b-cf5196b3cbea.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Wilson Chilo Buses in Aguas Calientes\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Wilson Chilo</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A fleet of buses ferry tourists to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in September, local protestors angry that Consettur was being replaced following what they saw as an insufficiently open bidding process, blocked the railway line to Aguas Calientes with rocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This resulted in Peruvian authorities having to clear the tracks and evacuate tourists on special train services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of local people, who didn't want to go on the record, say the protestors were unhappy that Consettur had a monopoly on the lucrative bus service, and that its position as sole provider was simply due to be transferred to new company San Antonio de Torontoy. A round-trip bus ticket costs $24 (£18) for a foreigner and $15 for a Peruvian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Consettur's licence ran out in September, it is continuing to run its buses. And due to legal challenges, San Antonio de Torontoy has yet to start.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a complex situation, involving people from different local communities wanting a slice of the bus income, but Mr Caballero is adamant that Consettur is not a monopoly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The owners of the business have been running the company for the past 30 years, and they are people who come from around here,\" he says. \"This is not a monopoly.

The cheapest round-trip ticket is $140, rising to $2,000 for luxury first class.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking in Aguas Calientes, she says: \"We thought it was one train [all the way to Machu Picchu]. And we thought if there was any more transport to get up there it would all be included, because you pay so much money for the train.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her friend and travelling companion Todd Carland adds that buying the entry tickets for the site \"was a nightmare for us\". He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region. The rest of the money goes to the Ministry of Culture to look after other archaeological sites around Peru and pay for wages.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wants more money to go to his community and the surrounding region to help improve tourism and fund more projects to help the locals.

Some claim he has tentacles emerging from his back, and most say he wears dark clothes and has a pale face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The girls said they believed Slender Man would kill their relatives if they did not kill their friend to please him, an attorney for Geyser <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-46794506\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said in court</a>.

I couldn't do anything,\" he told the BBC, adding that he called the police but it was too late by the time they arrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3w7621xypyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The Christian Association of Nigeria has said that 303 students and 12 members of staff were abducted</a> from the school, while 50 children managed to avoid being taken away and have been reunited with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The school is run by the chairman of the association's Niger chapter, Bishop Bulus Bawa Yohanna, who has shared a list of those abducted with the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the police said they were only aware of a few children escaping on the night of the abduction. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Niger state governor, Umar Bago, told local media that the number of abducted students had been exaggerated, and it was \"far, far below\" 303.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor blamed the school authorities for opening the establishment despite threats by unknown gunmen four years ago, and again two months ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The schools in that area have been closed for four years now. I was surprised to learn the school is still open,\" Bago said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also insisted that the attack was just a \"scare\" and that all students would be rescued sooner or later. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Items belonging to the pupils remain strewn around the school </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishop said that no security agencies have been deployed in the community since the abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with some other parents, Theo has been camping outside the school, angry with the government's response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our children were kidnapped but the government doesn't seem to pay attention to it,\" said Theo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he was frustrated that the state governor had not visited the school, and only went to a nearby community to speak to security agencies and local leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have concluded that the government is not concerned about us - we feel like we are not part of the country, they have abandoned us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pain being endured by the parents of those children who are still missing is all too evident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am sad, my whole life is filled with sadness,\" said a mother, whose son was among the children taken by the gunmen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's my only son, he's my first-born, please help us,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another parent, Lucas, told the BBC that two of his children had been abducted, but the youngest one, a six-year-old boy, was lucky and managed to avoid falling into the clutches of the kidnappers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I saw him, I was so excited. I called him by name, he turned and ran to me. I hugged and embraced him,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The northern part of Niger where Papiri is located has recently become a hot-spot for kidnappings for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs, but to little effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC team drove about 500km (310 miles) to Papiri from the Niger state's capital, Minna and was advised several times not to take certain routes and, for periods, was escorted by police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many blame the crisis on the size of the state. In terms of landmass, Niger is the largest state in Nigeria, and larger than European countries like Denmark and the Netherlands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also has a lot of forests, which criminal gangs, referred to locally as bandits, use as camps and routes to connect to other states in Nigeria, as well as neighbouring countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction at the school was the third to hit Nigeria in a week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in Kebbi state, which borders Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A church was also attacked further south in Kwara state, with two people killed and dozens of worshippers abducted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bola Tinubu cancelled his trip to the G20 summit, held in South Africa at the weekend, to deal with the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He posted on social media on Sunday that all the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/officialABAT/status/1992632498350637188\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">38 worshippers abducted in Kwara state had been rescued</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: I will not relent.

In her 2017 biography, she wrote that she heard Dharmendra telling fellow actor Shashi Kapoor in Punjabi, \"Kudi badi changi hai (The girl is quite pretty)\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their romance bloomed in the 1970s through superhit films like Seeta Aur Geeta, Raja Jani, and Sholay, making headlines as Dharmendra was already married with grown-up children with his first wife, Prakash Kaur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The media wrote about the resistance from Hema Malini's family to their wedding, but the couple finally tied the knot in 1980. Some reports said they had converted to Islam, which allows polygamy, to marry - a claim Dharmendra later denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The actor-producer also dabbled in politics. He was the BJP MP from Bikaner in Rajasthan for one term from 2005 to 2009. But he was criticised for not taking politics seriously as he rarely attended parliament, preferring to spend time shooting for films or working on his farm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to a television programme, Aap Ki Adalat, years later, he agreed that he was a misfit in politics. \"Politics is not for emotional people, it's for the thick-skinned,\" he said. \"These five years were very tough for me, they were difficult.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He worked almost to the end of his life, acting alongside his sons Sunny and Bobby Deol, judging reality shows, and connecting with fans via social media.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a7ee/live/857e0490-c915-11f0-b617-8f268340abd0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Bollywood actor Dharmendra (C) along with his sons Sunny Deol (R) and Bobby Deol (L) pose for a photo on the occasion of his 89th birthday at his residence in Mumbai on December 8, 2024.

The actor also described it as his finest role. \"I don't think I have ever done a better role than Veeru's,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite delivering dozens of hits, Dharmendra never made it to the \"number one\" slot in Bollywood - losing to contemporaries such as Dilip Kumar, Rajesh Khanna and Amitabh Bachchan - and was passed for the prestigious Filmfare awards several times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was finally in 1997 that Filmfare honoured him with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contribution to Hindi cinema and in 2012, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan - an Indian government honour given to civilians for distinguished service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Dharmendra wore his stardom lightly, staying away from the rat race and said he never wanted to be number one in the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I never asked for too much money, and fame is transient. All I ever wanted was people's love,\" he told an interviewer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I came here just for this love. Everyone loves Dharmendra and I am grateful for that,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, news of his death prompted tributes from the film fraternity on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Growing up, Dharmendra was the hero every boy wanted to be,\" said actor Akshay Kumar. \"Thank you for inspiring generations. You'll live on through your films and the love you spread.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Describing his passing as the \"end of an era\", director Karan Johar said it had left \"a gaping hole in the industry... a space that can never be filled by anyone... there will always be one and only Dharmendra\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

crime expert from Mexico's UNAM university, says the group's activities started in the late 1980s and early 1990s in response to developments in neighbouring Colombia, the world's largest producer of cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, the powerful Medellín Cartel, based in the Colombian city of the same name, was being dismantled and a major counter-narcotics offensive in the country was bearing fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As established smuggling routes came under pressure, Mr Benítez-Manau argues, the Cartel de los Soles began providing alternative ways to transport cocaine from Colombia. It then strengthened during the early years of the presidency of Hugo Chávez, the left-wing president who led Venezuela from 1999 to his death in 2013, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chávez liked to challenge the United States, and cut all military co-operation ties between the Venezuelan army and the US,\" he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the oversight of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), \"some [Venezuelan] army officers felt free to do business with criminals\", Mr Benítez-Manau says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chávez's sympathies with Colombia's left-wing Farc guerrillas - which financed themselves largely through cocaine smuggling - were another factor in re-routing some drug trafficking through Venezuela, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Facing military pressure at home, the guerrilla group moved some operations into Venezuela, safe in the knowledge that the Venezuelan president \"saw them as leftist ideological allies\", Mr Benítez-Manau explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wesley Tabor, a former DEA agent who worked in Venezuela, says the Farc not only found \"a safe haven in Venezuela\" but also many government officials, \"from street-level police to the military aviation\", soon became their partners in drug trafficking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Together, they \"began flooding the US with hundreds of tonnes of cocaine\", he says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4954/live/049099f0-8a69-11f0-84c8-99de564f0440.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Former Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal during his extradition hearing to the United States in Madrid, 2019.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Former intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cartel de los Soles, then, differs from other drug networks in that it lacks a formal structure,  says Mr LaSusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not a group per se, he says, but rather \"a system of widespread corruption\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds it has been fuelled by the economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela under President Chávez's successor in office, Nicolás Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Maduro regime cannot offer security forces a decent salary and, to keep their loyalty, it allows them to accept bribes from drug traffickers,\" Mr LaSusa explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mid- and lower-ranking officers who control Venezuela's key entry and exit points, such as airports, make up the Cartel de los Soles, Mr Benítez-Manau says, as they are in prime position to facilitate the flow of drugs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US officials are adamant that the tentacles of the Cartel de los Soles reach to the highest levels of the Maduro government, including the president himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, the US justice department accused Maduro and 14 others of conspiring with armed Colombian groups to ship cocaine to the United States. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the high-ranking officials named were Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino and the former head of Venezuela's Supreme Court, Maikel Moreno. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the indictment, US prosecutors also alleged that since at least 1999, the Cartel de los Soles was led and administered by Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, and former General Clíver Alcalá.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say information provided by former high-ranking Venezuelan military officials -

But the original US plan proposes that Ukraine give up the entire region - even parts it has successfully defended for nearly four years of full-scale war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let them take it,\" Snake told the BBC. \"There's practically no one left in the cities and villages… We're not fighting for the people but for the land, while losing more people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Andrii, an officer in Ukraine's general staff, says that what is being proposed for Luhansk and Donetsk is \"painful and difficult\" but he suggests the country may have no other choice.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has been defending the region since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea and its proxy forces seized parts of the Donbas. \"We may not want to give it up, but we won't be able to hold it by military force and resources,\" Andrii says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eastern Ukraine has been the scene of the heaviest fighting in this war, and Ukraine has lost tens of thousands of troops defending it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Matros, who has been fighting since 2018, told us giving up the Donbas would \"nullify everything - all the efforts of the armed forces\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will disregard the lives of fallen soldiers and civilians,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Cutting the size of Ukraine's armed forces</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US draft peace plan envisages limiting the size of Ukraine's armed forces to 600,000. That is still significantly more than before the full-scale invasion when its full-time strength was around 250,000, but smaller than its current size. The most recent estimates suggest Ukraine's military strength is more than 800,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Snake believes the country will need many of those currently in uniform to help rebuild Ukraine when the war ends. \"What's the point of having so many people in the army if there will be security guarantees?\" he asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Andrii the staff officer agrees. \"If there are security guarantees, then of course there's no point in keeping such a large army,\" he says. \"People are tired and want to return to their families. There's no reason to keep them in a peacetime army after the war.\" He believes Ukraine's economy would be unable to sustain such large armed forces in peacetime.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c386/live/60dd3540-c864-11f0-b4c8-47dc9718dd39.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Ukrainian soldiers in full battle dress sit on a cannon in a muddy field.  \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">It is thought more than 800,000 Ukrainians are currently in uniform</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Army medic Shtutser does not agree, saying that Ukraine's army \"is the only thing separating us from defeat and enslavement\" while Matros calls the proposal to reduce the size of the armed forces \"absurd and manipulative\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Security guarantees</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's willingness to agree to the proposals will depend on its future security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US draft plan rules out Ukraine's membership of Nato, but not of the European Union.

The draft also rules out the presence of Nato forces in Ukraine, if there is a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Yevhen, a drone operator in eastern Ukraine, thinks the presence of foreign troops in the country is an important security guarantee.

Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43588465\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries and is recovering from the legacy of a brutal 11-year civil war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">World Health Organization data</a> shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Undercover filming of a man who said he was a juju practitioner and claimed to sell human body parts</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a lecturer at the UK's Arden University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The police raided this house in Waterloo and arrested the occupants, including Idara, who were later charged under anti-witchcraft laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-chris-alcock-and-luis-barrucho\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</i></p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More BBC Africa Eye stories from Sierra Leone:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Hotels were full, restaurants bustling, and fishermen could barely keep up with demand. But that is no more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boom – and the abrupt collapse – was no accident. Between 2015 and 2017, Chinese tourists made up around half of its visitors. Then, in 2017, Beijing reportedly ordered tour operators to stop selling packages to Palau, slashing the main source of tourism to the islands at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I actually bought new boats to accommodate the sudden increase of tourists,\" said a dive shop owner in Koror. But after the tourism peak, he said, these boats had been \"sitting idle in the bay\" and it took them years just to make back the money they spent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message was clear, Palauan officials allege. They say that China had used its vast outbound tourism market as part of a broader campaign to try to peel Palau away from recognising Taiwan - and into Beijing's orbit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC reached out to China's foreign ministry for comment but has not received a response. China has, however, in the past repeatedly denied using tourism as political leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau is one of only a dozen nations that still recognise Taiwan as a sovereign state. This challenges a key pillar of China's foreign policy, the \"one China principle\", in which Beijing asserts sovereignty over Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's not just about a diplomatic tug of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau's location makes it a desirable target for influence from the world's biggest powers. It sits on the so-called \"Second Island Chain\" – a string of outposts the US sees as crucial to containing China's military expansion and responding to any aggression in the western Pacific.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau and the US have a long history of partnership: before its independence in 1994, Palau was a US-administered territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under an agreement known as the Compact of Free Association, Palau gives the US exclusive military access in exchange for Washington's extensive aid, including Palauan citizens' ability to live and work freely in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Working under the terms of the Compact, the US is now strengthening its own military footprint in the archipelago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This geopolitical power struggle between China, Taiwan, and the US is cascading down into the daily lives of this tiny nation of fewer than 20,000 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter what we do, Palau is going to be the centre of any military activity because of our location,\" Palau's President, Surangel Whipps Jr. told the BBC.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Palau's president, Surangel Whipps Jr.</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A prize in the Pacific</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palau's relationship with Taiwan runs deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Palau became independent in 1994, Taiwan moved fast to secure a diplomatic ally, according to Cheng-Cheng Li, an assistant professor at National Dong Hwa University in Hualien, Taiwan, who has conducted extensive research on Taiwan-Palau relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's assistance to it has been hands-on: agricultural experts working side by side with locals, medical teams in small clinics, funding for local entrepreneurs, and inviting students to Taiwan on scholarships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a country with a small population where community-based service plays a central role, Taiwan has been described as a \"reliable partner\" and a \"trusted friend\" by many Palauan officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's ambassador to Palau, Jessica Lee, told the BBC that local leaders had assured her that the relationship was \"solid as a rock until death do us part.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Taiwan has reason to worry. In recent years, China has peeled away several of its former allies. In the Pacific region alone, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru have severed their diplomatic ties with it and switched to Beijing since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing sees the democratically governed island of Taiwan as a breakaway province that will, eventually, be part of the country, and has not ruled out the use of force to achieve this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Controlling Taiwan is essential to Chinese leader Xi Jinping's goal of reversing what he called China's \"century of humiliation\" by colonial powers, according to analysts.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"One Stop Shop,\" a government building in Palau, donated by Taiwan</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both the US and Taiwan are paranoid and jumpy about Palau switching,\" said Graeme Smith, a senior fellow at the Australian National University. \"They'll put a lot of resources into making sure it doesn't happen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials in both Palau and Taiwan say Beijing has pulled on a range of levers to influence Palau's diplomatic position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After he took office in 2021, Palau's president publicly claimed that China offered \"a million\" tourists in exchange for Palau to this end. He refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then in 2024, China's foreign ministry issued a safety alert, advising Chinese nationals to \"exercise caution\" when travelling to Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If China uses tourism as a weapon, then it's an unstable market that we shouldn't depend on,\" President Whipps Jr. told the BBC. \"If China wants a relationship with Palau, they can, but they cannot tell us we cannot have a relationship with Taiwan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China, however, denies using tourism as a political tool.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an opinion published last year in the People's Daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist party, the paper stated that China's intention when issuing the alert was to protect its overseas citizens in light of the \"increasing public security cases in Palau\". It added that the accusations from the president were an attempt to smear China and interfere in its domestic affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked in 2017 about the banning of tour groups, China's foreign ministry spokesperson said that he \"had not heard about the situation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 2024, responding to Palau's continued recognition of Taiwan, the ministry urged Palau to \"make the correct decisions that conform to their own... interests\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whilst China has not commented on the alleged offer of a million tourists, not everyone agrees with President Whipps Jr.'s assessment. Many locals who spoke with the BBC don't share the president's view on tourism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's very hawkish towards China,\" said Pai Lee, the Taiwanese owner of a hotel in Koror. \"I don't think it's correct to say that China 'weaponised' tourism – they are simply using this as a bargaining chip, just like how people play chess and countries do it all the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any case, the legacy of the sudden tourism swing remains visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The economic shock after the suspension of tour groups  was sharp, but so was the environmental toll of the sudden influx of tourists itself. Palau, according to environmental protection organisations, was not ready for mass tourism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After the end of the explosion of Chinese tourism, I went there and the corals were dead,\" said Ann Singeo, director of the Ebiil Society, a local NGO.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You'd see [hundreds of] people in this little cove, all standing on corals. That was the price we paid because we didn't have rules in place to use these resources respectfully.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aerial shot of Rock Islands, Koror, Palau</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism is just one part of China's alleged playbook. Beijing has also been trying to strengthen relationships with local leaders: Palauan officials say they have repeatedly been invited to Beijing for visits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one such visit, a former Palauan governor said he asked why Taiwan couldn't become independent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Taiwan is part of China\", replied a Chinese Communist Party official, looking furious.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The US factor</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With China's intensifying military activities around Taiwan, including air and sea patrols, the US has claimed that China is readying its military to be capable of invading it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To contain China's potential aggression towards Taiwan and overall military activities in the western Pacific, the US has ramped up its own military infrastructure buildup in Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, Washington has been upgrading airstrips, building Tactical Multi-Mission Over-the-horizon Radar system (Tacmor) used to monitor military activities in the Pacific, and planning on expanding Malakal Harbour, Palau's main port, to accommodate larger military vessels.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Field cleared for construction for Tacmor receiver site in Angaur, Palau</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US has expressed concern over a particular vulnerability: land acquisition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Documents seen by the BBC show that several Chinese businesses have leased land and developed properties close to these sites, from undeveloped land to hotels overlooking the harbour and Palau's main airport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Angaur, a southern state of Palau, for example, the US is now building the receiver site of Tacmor – the plan was announced in 2017. However, in 2019 and 2020, Chinese investors leased land covering over 350,000 square metres following the announcement of radar construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One investor, Zhuang Cizhong, proposed building a resort there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We went to visit his company in China, and he laid out a plan for a retirement home for rich Chinese,\" said the former governor of Angaur, Marvin Ngirutang, who believes Palau's government should work more closely with China. \"There were booklets of blueprints – it looked legitimate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The project was never built. Zhuang blamed Covid-19, but Washington remains wary. The US ambassador in Palau could not be reached for comment, but he has previously voiced his concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All around there are various plots of land now leased to Chinese interests,\" US ambassador Joel Ehrendreich told Reuters. \"I don't think it's any coincidence that it happens to be physically close to our projects.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such worries are shared locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The concern is that these investments or leases are not legitimate businesses,\" said Jennifer Anson, Palau's national security advisor. \"Maybe on the outside, but when the time comes that China invades Taiwan, these could be transformed into military sites.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese media reports, however, suggest that there were legitimate reasons to push for businesses to invest in Palau. In 2019, Phoenix News, a state-affiliated broadcaster, extolled the virtues of buying property in Palau, citing abundant tourism resources and relaxed legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC is unable to contact Zhuang. China's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on matters related to land leases.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">In the shadows of a diplomatic void</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese-linked organised crime has also proliferated since 2018, according to authorities in Palau. President Whipps Jr. said that there was a \"constant battle going on\" as he pointed to crimes linked to China, including scamming, illegal casinos, and cyberattacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some officials claim criminals have exploited the lack of diplomatic ties between China and Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wan Kuok Koi, known as \"Broken Tooth,\" who led the infamous Macau-based 14k triad, for example, entered Palau as a foreign investor in 2018. The crime syndicate later engaged in bribery, corruption and online gambling in countries including Palau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Additionally, in 2025, the US Treasury sanctioned several individuals in Palau for their links to the Prince Group, a Chinese-run conglomerate. The group has been accused of scamming, money laundering, industrial-scale human trafficking, among other crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prince Group did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but has previously \"categorically\" denied having engaged in \"any unlawful activity,\" according to the company's statement following the US sanction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of these individuals have been placed on Palau's own \"undesirable alien list\", and according to Ms. Anson from Palau's national security office, they are banking on China's inability to hunt them down because of the lack of diplomatic relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you trawl Chinese diaspora sites in Cambodia, where the wisdom of relocating to Palau is sometimes debated, the criminals themselves are drawn by the lack of PRC diplomatic presence there,\" said ANU's Graeme Smith.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Pawn of powers</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many Palauans, talk of high-level geopolitical struggle feels distant, yet its ripples are everywhere. The US military expansion, Chinese investment, and rumours of hidden agendas feed a growing sense of unease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This administration is very hawkish towards China, and I think it's ridiculous,\" said the former governor of Angaur, who opposes the construction of Tacmor. \"We should concentrate on the environment and less on China-US relations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A petition circulating in recent months asks Washington to spell out its contingency plans in the event of war – a sign of how deep the anxiety runs. It calls on the US to \"reassure the people of Palau\" that civilians will be protected if conflict was o break out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know what the geopolitics looks like between China and the US,\" said one resident. \"And we are scared our island will be destroyed by a war we don't want to be part of\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"><i id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-on-monday-24-november-at-7pm-on-bbc-two-and-also-on-iplayer.-internationally,-viewers-can-see-global-eye-on-the-bbc-news-channel-this-weekend\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye on Monday 24 November at 7pm on BBC Two and also on iPlayer.

Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In the streets of Caracas, daily life continues while the government tells the population that they must be ready for a US invasion</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let whatever happens happen!

That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail.

At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary.

Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food.

Speed is crucial as they are within the range of deadly Russian drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fifth brigade's new \"toy\" is an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), a robot that provides a lifeline for Ukrainian troops at the front in Pokrovsk and Myrnograd, a strategic hub in eastern Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian forces are relentlessly trying to cut off Ukraine's supply routes in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without fresh food and ammunition, Ukraine's frontline soldiers would face a choice of either surrender or a costly retreat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv has sent special forces, elite assault units and drone groups to reinforce its troops in and around Pokrovsk, but Russia's grip on routes into the city means going in with armoured vehicles would bring almost certain death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Transporting heavy supplies on foot would be just as dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is where the robot, also known as a land drone, comes in place of traditional troop deployments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The battle of Pokrovsk will probably go down in history as the first in which unmanned ground vehicles were used on a mass scale, largely to deliver supplies and evacuate wounded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The robot is small enough to squeeze into a bicycle lane and looks like a mini tank without a turret.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UGVs are difficult to spot, they are harder to jam than an aerial drone and, most importantly, soldiers can operate them remotely from a safer location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They save soldiers' lives and are the future of the army, according to Ihor, the head of unmanned systems for the 7th Corps of the Ukrainian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 90% of all supplies for Pokrovsk frontline are now delivered by UGVs, he says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Russian forces are trying to capture the city by choking the supply chains and relentlessly launching remote-controlled drones to target anything that moves in what is widely called \"the kill-zone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This 30km-wide stretch of territory along the frontline is within reach of drones from both sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Constant aerial reconnaissance means any movement in the kill-zone is quickly detected and attacked, by drones as well as conventional weapons such as artillery, mortar rounds and aerial bombs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a situation that military doctor Vitsik and his land drone operator Auditor know only too well. These are their call signs, not their real names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they tried to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers from Pokrovsk last month they were quickly spotted and had only seconds to rush to a nearby house to escape the buzz of Russian drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One drone after another attacked us,\" Vitsik recalls. \"As soon as the drone hit the ground and exploded, immediately the next one appeared. They also fired from artillery and mortars trying to kill us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The walls Vitsik and Auditor hid behind shook with each explosion. The barrage lasted for 59 minutes and they eventually slipped into a neighbouring building and escaped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inside Pokrovsk the drone threat from above is ever present.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We run from one bush to another, from one house to another, from one street to another,\" says Vitsik.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36dc/live/6ead34d0-c6e9-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Vitsik via BBC A selfie of a young man wearing Ukrainian military uniform.

This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What platforms are affected?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">have recently introduced age checks</a> on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria.

Those mistakenly kicked off could use a government ID or provide a video selfie to verify their age, the company said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Snapchat has said users can use bank accounts or photo IDs to verify their age or take a selfie, which will be used to estimate their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other affected platforms have not yet said how they will comply with the ban.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will it work? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without a clear idea of what methods companies will be using, it's hard to say whether the social media ban will be effective - but concerns have been raised that age assurance technologies may wrongly block some users while failing to spot others who are underage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/department/media/publications/age-assurance-technology-trial-final-report\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">own report</a> found that facial assessment technology, for example, is least reliable for the exact demographic it's needed to target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Questions have also been raised as to whether the fines for infringement are big enough. As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children. Dating websites and gaming platforms are not included, and nor are AI chatbots, which have recently <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xgwyywe4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">made headlines</a> for allegedly encouraging children to commit suicide and for having \"sensual\" conversations with minors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others point out that teens who rely on social media for community will be left isolated, and argue that educating children about how to navigate social media would be more effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Communications Minister Annika Wells has conceded that the ban may not be \"perfect\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to look a bit untidy on the way through,\" she said in early November. \"Big reforms always do.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Are there data protection concerns?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics have also raised concerns about the large-scale collection and storage of data that will be required, and its potential mishandling, as platforms try to verify users' ages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia - like much of the world - has in recent years seen a series of high-profile data breaches, including several where sensitive personal information was stolen and sold or published.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the government says the legislation incorporates \"strong protections\" for personal information. These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How have social media companies responded?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images The YouTube brand on the side of a building, with a sign in the shape of the YouTube logo jutting out from the same building\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Though included in the ban, YouTube has denied being a social media company</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do other countries have similar bans?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epennv98lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new safety rules</a> introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjep23403o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">French parliamentary enquiry</a> recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will children try to get around the ban?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents. Commentators are also predicting a surge in the use of VPNs - which hide the country a person is accessing the internet from - as happened in the UK after the implementation of age control rules.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
