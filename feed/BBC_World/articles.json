As it attempts to drive off, one of them points his gun at the driver and at least two shots are heard. The FBI is investigating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of ICE agents have been deployed to Minneapolis, in the state of Minnesota, as part of the White House's crackdown on illegal immigration.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Using an expletive, the city's Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey urged the agents to leave the city, following the fatal shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos posted to social media by onlookers appear to show the moment of the shooting, which occurred around 10:25 local time on Wednesday morning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From various vantage points, a maroon SUV can be seen blocking a residential street in Minneapolis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A crowd of people, who appear to be protesting, are lining the pavement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Law enforcement vehicles appear nearby. ICE agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Republican president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, \"and she began to drive off\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8b50/live/162c0990-ec7c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"ODU Photo of Renee Good taken from ODU English dept Facebook page\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">ODU</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The woman has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, 37</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was \"stalking and impeding\" officers throughout the day and tried to \"weaponise her vehicle\" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The federal agent fired \"defensive shots\" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbours\" when she was shot and killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emily Heller told CNN she was at home when she saw the ICE agents arguing with protesters outside. She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,\" Heller told the US network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Top Democrats, including former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements.

Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,\" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?'

As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These latest withdrawals come after the president <b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20px1e05w0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time</a> last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

administration would \"oversee\" the running of the South American nation following the seizure by US forces of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro in a raid on Saturday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also did not say if or when elections would be held in Venezuela to replace the interim government headed by Maduro loyalist Delcy Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said the ouster of Maduro had set off an \"irreversible process\" that would lead Venezuela to be \"free\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New York Times (NYT) journalists quizzed Trump on his plans for the future of Venezuela days after he had said his administration would run the oil-rich nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Wednesday, the White House had said that the US would control sales of sanctioned oil \"indefinitely\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the US needed control over Venezuela's oil sales for leverage over the interim government in Caracas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said his administration would be \"taking oil\" from Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven reserves, but acknowledged it would \"take a while\" to get the country's oil industry up and running.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's oil production has plummeted as a result of mismanagement on the part of the Maduro government and that of his predecessor, as well as years of US sanctions.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch:

Secretary of State Marco Rubio was \"in constant communication\" with Rodríguez, who was designated as Venezuela's interim leader by the country's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Rodríguez is \"giving us everything that we feel is necessary.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president had earlier said that the interim government had agreed to use the proceeds from the sale of its oil to buy only US-made goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the NYT reporters, Trump did not answer their questions about why he recognised Rodríguez as Venezuela's new leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Venezuela analysts had expected that the ouster of Maduro would be followed swiftly by the return to the country of opposition leaders Edmundo González and María Corina Machado.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in his first news conference following the US raid, Trump was dismissive about  Machado, alleging that she lacked the \"respect\" and support to lead Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it would be very tough for her to be the leader,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado managed to unite opposition groups behind her ahead of the 2024 presidential election but was barred from running for the presidency by officials loyal to the Maduro government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She then threw her weight behind former diplomat González, who acted as her proxy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The electoral council, which is also dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro re-elected. However, voting tallies collected by the opposition, which have been independently verified, suggest González won by a landslide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">González went into exile to escape the government repression that followed the election, and Machado went into hiding within Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She embarked on a perilous journey by land, sea and air to reach Oslo in December to collect the Nobel Peace Prize she was awarded for her \"tireless work promoting democratic rights\" in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her current whereabouts are unknown but she has said that she plans to return to Venezuela soon.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://lapatilla.com/2026/01/07/maria-corina-machado-en-exclusiva-a-la-patilla-este-proceso-es-irreversible-venezuela-va-a-ser-libre/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Venezuelan opposition news site La Patilla</a>, she insisted that the ousting of Maduro had set her country on an irreversible path towards freedom. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said that she hoped this new phase of the transition process would be \"as short and swift as possible\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that the interim government, which she said was \"the same regime it was under Maduro\" was \"being given instructions to dismantle itself\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado insisted that González was the legitimate president-elect and urged that his mandate be respected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She stressed that \"the first thing\" that needed to happen was for the political prisoners to be released. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado is not the only one who has been demanding that the more than 800 political prisoners held in Venezuela's notorious jails be freed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Republican lawmaker María Elvira Salazar published several posts on social media insisting they be released \"immediately\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, in his interview with the NYT, Trump instead \"appeared far more focused on the rescue mission than the details of how to navigate Venezuela's future\", according to the journalists who spoke to him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what the US plans for Venezuela are, he said that \"we will rebuild it in a very profitable way\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"We're going to be using oil, and we're going to be taking oil. We're getting oil prices down, and we're going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is expected to meet representatives of three of the largest US oil companies at the White House on Friday to discuss those plans further.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In recent days, Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had been given a green light by US President Donald Trump to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the ceasefire, Israel has carried out near-daily attacks on targets it says are linked to Hezbollah and continues to occupy at least five positions in southern Lebanon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lebanese government rejects the Israeli claims, and says Israel's actions are a violation of the ceasefire deal and an obstacle to the army's efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has not made the evidence it says it has about Hezbollah's activities public, and the UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, known as Unifil, says it has seen no indication that the group is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lebanese officials say the next stage of the army's plan will focus on the area between the Litani and the Awali rivers, which includes the port city of Sidon. There is no timeline for that, and the cash-strapped Lebanese army has also complained of insufficient funding and equipment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, it is unclear if Hezbollah will resist the measures in other areas as it says it will not disarm north of the Litani. The group also has a strong presence in the eastern Bekaa valley and in Beirut's southern suburbs, known as the Dahieh. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun has rejected the use of force against the group, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hezbollah - which is also a political party with representation in parliament and in the government, and a social movement that runs hospitals and schools - still enjoys significant support among Lebanon's Shia community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents, however, see this as a unique opportunity to disarm the group, after its losses in the war. Hezbollah, so far, has rejected calls from the authorities to discuss the future of its weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Lebanon's south, tens of thousands of residents remain displaced and communities lie in ruins, as Lebanon's international partners have conditioned funds for reconstruction on measures that include action against Hezbollah.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They comprise:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">investigating the \"nature and prevalence of antisemitism\" and its \"key drivers\" in Australia</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">making recommendations to enforcement, border immigration and security agencies to tackle antisemitism</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"> examining the circumstances surrounding the Bondi attack</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">making any other recommendations for strengthening social cohesion and countering the spread of ideological and religiously motivated extremism</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister said the work of Dennis Richardson, the former spy chief leading a review into intelligence and law enforcement agencies, would be wrapped into the royal commission, with an interim report expected in April.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former High Court justice Virginia Bell has been appointed to lead the commission, Albanese said, adding that he had asked her to report by December 2026 and that \"this won't be a drawn-out process.\" Previous royal commissions have taken years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This royal commission is the right format, the right duration and the right terms of reference to deliver the right outcome for our national unity and our national security,\" Albanese said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rumours that Bell was to be appointed had earlier drawn criticism from the Jewish community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg said prior to Albanese's announcement the prime minister had been told by Jewish leaders there were \"serious concerns\" about her appointment, without specifying what they were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking alongside Albanese, Attorney General Michelle Rowland said Bell was \"an eminent and highly capable former Justice of the High Court of Australia, and I have no doubt that she will examine the complex issues ahead with impartiality and precision\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing concerns that a royal commission could interfere with the criminal legal proceedings against the alleged gunman who survived, Albanese added: \"It's one of the reasons why we chose someone who has a criminal law background, has been in senior positions in the Supreme Court and the High Court of Australia. That is, she's the most qualified person we could possibly consider.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also added that the inquiry was not meant to \"provide a solution on Gaza or on the Middle East\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The truth is that some people have held Jewish Australians to account for views or actions that that they're opposed to, that have nothing to do with them,\" Albanese said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the days after the attack, state and federal leaders agreed to tighten gun controls, including limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual and on the types of firearms that can be held, as well as a buyback scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese also promised hate speech reform including penalties for preachers and leaders who promote violence and a new federal offence of \"aggravated hate speech\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He previously said his government would adopt the recommendations put forward by antisemitism commissioner Jillian Segal in a July report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her report was criticised by some upon its release due to its implications for free speech, such as plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking alongside the prime minister on Thursday, Segal said the government's decision was \"the right one and an important one\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It does reflect the seriousness of the growth in antisemitism and its impact on our country and our democracy,\" she said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,\" Gunson says. \"There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration,\" says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas programme at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the challenges, he says, have only just begun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals... are going to take much more time to come to fruition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: The key questions on Trump’s actions on Venezuela</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater co-operation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think she can deliver on that,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In remarks to the media on Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan would lead to what Rubio called \"a process of reconciliation\", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,\" he said, without elaborating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming \"permanently unavailable to serve\" - something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said elections were not on the horizon. \"We have to fix the country first,\" he said. \"You can't have an election.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,\" he says. \"Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says the reality may be more complicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required... to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez designated Maduro as his successor shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's \"dedazo\", a Spanish slang term meaning a \"finger pointing\", a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is Trump's dedazo,\" he says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Frankly, it was not what I expected. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no screens or keyboards, let alone holographic head cams or brain-reading chips. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow is an oil barrel-sized series of round discs connected by hundreds of black control wires descending into a bronze liquid helium bath refrigerator keeping the quantum microchip a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It looks, and feels, very eighties, but if quantum's potential is realised, the metal and wire jellyfish structure in front of me will transform the world, in many ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Welcome to our Quantum AI lab,\" says Hartmut Neven, Google's Quantum AI chief, as we go through the high security door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven is something of a legendary figure, part technological genius, part techno music enthusiast, who dresses like he has snowboarded here straight from the Burning Man music festival – for which he designs art. Perhaps he has, in a parallel universe - more on that later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His mission is to turn theoretical physics into functional quantum computers \"to solve otherwise unsolvable problems\" and he admits he's biased but says these chandeliers are the best performing in the world.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Faisal Islam was shown around a Google facility in Santa Barbara</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Secret temple of high science</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of our conversation is about what we are not allowed to film in this restricted lab. This critical technology is subject to export controls, secrecy and is at the heart of a race for commercial and economic supremacy. Any small advantage, from the shape of new components to the companies in global supply chains, is a source of potential leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a notable Californian vibe in this temple of high science, in its art and colour. Each quantum computer is given a name such as Yakushima or Mendocino, they are each wrapped in a piece of contemporary art, and various graffiti-style murals adorn the walls illuminated by the bright winter sun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven holds up Willow, Google's latest quantum chip, which has delivered two important milestones. He said it settled \"once and for all\" the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years, so more than a trillion trillion, or one with 25 zeros on the end, more than the age of the universe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven reels off the ways he believes this Willow quantum chip will be used \"to help with many problems that humankind has now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently,\" he says. \"It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport energy, to store energy... solve climate change and human hunger.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us,\" he tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some researchers believe that actual Artificial Intelligence will only be truly possible with quantum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the team here have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into \"superconducting qubits\" used here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Willow chip has 105 qubits. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04gvx7egw5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Microsoft's quantum effort has 8 qubits</a>, but uses a different approach. The race around the world is to get to 1 million qubits for a \"utility scale machine\" that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error. The technology is fragile.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Companies around the world are racing to make a revolutionary new generation of computers.</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What is going on here is being watched carefully around the world. Professor Sir Peter Knight, Chair of the National Quantum Technology Programmes Strategy Advisory Board, says Willow broke new ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This puts the technology on a path to being scaled towards accurately doing a trillion operations, perhaps within seven or eight years, rather than the two decades previously assumed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the first quarter of this century was defined by the rise of the internet and then Artificial Intelligence, the next 25 years will surely be the start of the quantum era.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How does it work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed drawers. A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time. Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops. But the point is that the power of these computers grows exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked Nvidia chief Jensen Huang whether this poses a threat to his model of providing the specialised chips for AI. \"No, a quantum processor will be added to a computer in the future,\" he replied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And one of the UK's leaders in the field points out what is up for grabs in the quantum world - the eventual power to decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat,\" Sir Peter says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A top partner to Nvidia last year said that while Bitcoin had a few years yet, the technology needed to fork to a stronger blockchain by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tech industry sources refer to the process of \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" to describe how state agencies are believed to be saving all of the world's encrypted data at home and abroad with the expectation of future generations being able to access it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Global race</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And then there is the race across the world. China's approach is very different to the commercial race in the US and the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At around $15bn (£11bn), the total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of all the rest of the world's government programmes put together, says Sir Peter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2022 China has published more scientific papers on quantum than other countries, the efforts have been led by a pioneering physicist called Pan Jianwei. It is a key part of Beijing's 14th five-year plan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China took a decision to stop its tech companies such as Baidu and Alibaba from developing their own quantum research – and concentrate the people and the infrastructure into a state-run enterprise. China is trying to get the edge on quantum communications and satellites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Pan developed and tested the Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum computer using similar technology though a different approach to that of Willow, claiming similar results. In the autumn it was opened up for commercial use. It all feels a little like the World War Two Manhattan Project to produce the first nuclear weapons, or the Space Race of the 21st Century.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK is one of the scientific heartlands for quantum research. It was a British scientist who did the original research on superconducting qubits. There are dozens of companies and cutting-edge research here. The government plans to make a significant investment around this in the coming weeks. It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Parallel universes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is still a spirited debate,\" he tells me. \"As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch two to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was \"suggestive that we should take this idea seriously\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpLvGmPetds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"address to the nation\".</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the world still unwrapping the tariffs \"gift\" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although \"the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced\", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2025/october/english/execsum.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to slow to 3.1% in 2026.</a> A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbim.no/en/news-and-insights/podcast/2025/kristalina-georgieva-leading-the-imf-navigating-global-crises-and-strengthening-cooperation/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"better than we feared, worse than it needs to be\".</a> Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other forecasts for 2026 are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piie.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/piie-sees-global-economic-growth-slowing-2026-amid-policy-headwinds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">even more pessimistic</a> than that of the IMF.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because \"countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Obstfeld adds: \"And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trumps-trade-war-with-china-2025-2025-10-13/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">more tariffs and other trade restrictions</a> in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the resilience seen so far, \"these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time\", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://unctad.org/news/global-trade-hit-record-35-trillion-despite-slowing-momentum\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">more than $35tn (£26tn).</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. \"The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Countries including the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly4jz9zr50o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">South Korea</a> and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump.
