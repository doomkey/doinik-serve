Trump.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those comments were widely criticised, including by prominent Republicans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kentucky representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who has clashed with Trump since the president returned to the White House in January, wrote on X: \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was once a staunch supporter of Trump before recently becoming a frequent critic, said that \"this is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies\" and that the murders should be \"met with empathy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple other senior members of Trump's party appeared to distance themselves from the remarks. Senator John Kennedy, a Republican representing Louisiana, said he thought Trump should not have made the comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man,\" Kennedy said. \"I think President Trump should have said nothing.

And as recently as October, Reiner said he believed Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hours after his social media post, Trump repeated his thoughts on Reiner in comments given in the Oval Office to reporters, describing the director as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" previous claims of collusion between Russia and Trump's team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has in the past criticised political foes after their death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the death of Arizona Senator John McCain - with whom he clashed regularly - in 2019, for example, Trump said he \"was never a fan\" and \"never will be\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another incident the same year, Trump quipped that the late Democratic lawmaker John Dingell could be \"looking up\" at him from the grave, a comment which was widely interpreted as a suggestion that Dingell was in hell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement following the remarks about Dingell, the White House said that the president was \"just riffing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reiner, who was 78, was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He married Michele, an actress, photographer and producer, in 1989, later recalling that they met during the making of one of his best-known films, When Harry Met Sally. The couple had three children together - including Nick, 32.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michele, 68, owned the Reiner Light photography agency and production house.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were shot in the front.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gunmen went on a shooting spree that lasted around ten minutes before police shot both men, killing one and critically injuring the other.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have also been questions about whether adequate security was provided before the shooting took place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They shoot, shoot, change magazine and just shoot,\" one witness, Shmulik Scuri, told reporters the day of the assault, adding he thought officers \"froze\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about these criticisms, Minns said the \"rush to conclusions\" about the police operation was \"disrespectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They didn't take a backward step. They engaged the gunmen on the footbridge with handguns. The offenders had long range rifles,\" Minns said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there's any suggestion that NSW Police didn't live up to their responsibilities to the people of this state, it should be rejected because it's not consistent with the facts.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon avoided questions about how many officers had been deployed to police the event in advance.

Russia mostly occupies the region and it wants Kyiv to hand it over in its entirety, which Ukraine is staunchly refusing to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US officials said Washington was now willing to submit a security package for Senate ratification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Zelensky and European leaders, describing it as a \"very good talk\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever,\" he said, referring to reaching a peace deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who hosted the discussions, struck a similar tone earlier on Monday, saying \"this is the first time a ceasefire is conceivable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a huge progress which I welcome very much,\" he said, describing Washington's security guarantees as \"remarkable\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several European leaders, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal which Ukraine presented to the US last week, to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide it with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend more than a million Ukrainian households were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Zelensky said on Monday that there was not a \"single functioning power station\" that had not been attacked by the Russians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98nnd01g91o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets</a> held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I don't have anything to add at the moment.\" He did not say whether they would appeal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jimmy Lai's son Sebastien urged the UK government to \"do more\" to help free his father.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's time to put action behind words and make my father's release a precondition to closer relationships with China,\" he told a press conference in London. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK condemned what it described as \"politically motivated persecution\" of Lai, saying he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office said in a statement on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese government abused Jimmy Lai with the aim of silencing all those who dare to criticise the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],\" said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, following the verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the face of the farce of Jimmy Lai's case, governments should pressure the authorities to withdraw the case and release him immediately.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun responded to the criticism \"by certain countries\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China expresses strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the brazen defamation and smearing of the judicial system in Hong Kong,\" he told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to \"do everything to save\" Lai, while UK PM Keir Starmer had said securing his release was a \"priority\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A test of judicial independence</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai's trial came to be widely seen as yet another test of judicial independence for Hong Kong's courts, which have been accused of toeing Beijing's line since 2019, when it tightened its control over the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong authorities insist the rule of law is intact but critics point to the hundreds of protesters and activists who have been jailed under the NSL - and its nearly 100% conviction rate as of May this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bail is also often denied in NSL cases and that was the case with Lai too, despite rights groups and Lai's children raising concerns about his deteriorating health. He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sebastien Lai told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\" - \"Given his age, given his health... he will <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cger51y928ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">die in prison</a>.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission.

An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes,\" a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his testimony, Lai had said that he had \"never allowed\" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a \"conspiracy\" and \"too crazy to think about\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,\" he had said. These values, he added, include the \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change.

I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work. Human rights abuses existed, that's true. But as a government it was good, we used to have peace and tranquility.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast's brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Pinochet was an army general who led a US-backed military coup in 1973 and established a 17-year-long military dictatorship that was marked by brutal human rights abuses, forced disappearances and free-market economic policies.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f90c/live/911b7b30-d94a-11f0-aba3-ad58b9c09695.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Jeannette Jara, presidential candidate of the ruling leftist coalition and member of the Communist Party, addresses supporters as she concedes defeat in the presidential runoff election, in Santiago, Chile.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Communist Party member Jeannette Jara was the left-wing coalition candidate</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chile's current left-wing President Gabriel Boric, who could not run again, had suffered from low approval ratings.

They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this. But Belarus is a close ally of Russia, including in its war on Ukraine, and the move comes as the US has been re-engaging with Moscow too, seeking a peace deal.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC captures celebrations as Belarus frees political prisoners</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dozens of prisoners Lukashenko agreed to let go were always expected to come here to Vilnius, Lithuania, where a crowd of friends, relatives and fellow activists gathered outside the US embassy in the freezing cold to greet them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some came wrapped in the red and white opposition flag of Belarus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tatsiana Khomich, Masha Kolesnikova's sister who had campaigned for over five years for her release, couldn't stop smiling. \"I've just spoken to Masha,\" she told me after a video call.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A professional flautist before the disputed 2020 elections, Kolesnikova spent much of her sentence in solitary confinement, denied even letters and phone calls to her family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's fine, she's good. I just want to hug her. I still can't quite believe it,\" her sister said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suddenly, there was a commotion in the crowd: a police car, blue lights flashing, was heading towards the US embassy gates, leading a small convoy of other vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there was no way all 123 ex-prisoners were inside. Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Optimism and activism'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So has the US gone too far, I wondered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump now uses carrots. He also can use sticks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few steps away, a man waving a giant flag worried that Lukashenko would just take more prisoners. This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it. This is so emotional,\" he shared, describing being woken at 04:00 and told by his prison guard to pack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When I asked what he wanted now most of all he didn't hesitate: \"I want to see my wife!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She's on her way, I was told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bialiatski's own organisation, Viasna, monitors political detentions in Belarus and the activist reminded everyone that many hundreds of people like him - only less well known - have been left behind bars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very important for everyone to continue to work for those political prisoners who are still in Belarusian prisons, to strive for the complete release of all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, lifting the red and white flag from his shoulders, he had a message for Belarusians everywhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Optimism and activism,\" Ales Bialiatski told them, with a sudden smile. \"Never give up!\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

(If they were alive in the 1980s, they may well have voted for Reagan.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other hand, 29% are what the Institute called \"new entrant Republicans\". It is among those new Republicans that the challenge to the durability of Trump's coalition presents itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only just over half said they would \"definitely\" support a Republican in next year's mid-term congressional elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the survey, the new entrants are younger, more diverse and more likely to hold views that break with traditional conservative orthodoxy. They hold comparatively more left-leaning views of economic policy, they tend to be more liberal on immigration and social issues, and they may also be more pro-China or critical of Israel, for example.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Someone wears a MAGA ring \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump was able to attract 'new entrant Republican' voters into his coalition - the question is whether he and his political heirs can keep them, or if they even want to</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jesse Arm, vice-president of external affairs at the Manhattan Institute, told the BBC in an email: \"A lot of the conversation about the future of the right is being driven by the loudest and strangest voices online, rather than by the voters who actually make up the bulk of the Republican coalition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps not surprisingly, the so-called new entrant Republican voters are significantly less supportive of some of Trump's would-be heirs.

It is happening just as Moscow's own shadow war on Europe is escalating again with a wave of arson and sabotage attacks that officials link to Russian intelligence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emergency response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lithuanian government has declared an emergency situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Balloons have been used by smugglers before, but this October their number suddenly surged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course it started as organised crime activity across the border, but we've seen more than once how Belarus instrumentalises organised crime to have an effect on neighbouring countries,\" Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told the BBC in the capital Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says the balloons are launched from spots that help them best \"target\" Lithuania's main airport, just 30km (19 miles) from the border.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want to make a smuggling operation to take a couple of thousand packs of cigarettes to the other side, you'd do it in the woods or the swamps, not directly at our airport!\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he believes the balloons are a form of political blackmail on Europe's eastern edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Belarus] sees this as leverage: 'You have a border with us, we can cause you huge problems',\" Budrys says. \"What they're doing is really touching the military and security field and we want to prevent a military escalation.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now every night the military police head out on patrol in the border zone. The balloons are most common after dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rattling across fields to reach remote country roads, they then set up mobile checkpoints and step out to stop vehicles at random. They check the drivers' documents and search car boots looking for anyone who may be involved in the smuggling, in the hope of smashing the networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The balloons fly too high to make shooting them down with air defences a safe or economic option, so the government has offered a €1m (£870,000) prize to any firm that can figure out how to intercept them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, teams use military radar to track the balloons in the sky and try to catch smugglers who turn up where the cargo drops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, new criminal charges should also act as a deterrent - with a possible prison sentence for acts of sabotage against civil aviation.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Authorities are patrolling the roads at night, searching for smugglers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the best protection for now is a change in wind direction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was blowing east into Belarus the night we were out with the patrol and the only boxes the soldiers found in a car were full of Christmas shopping not contraband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't seen any balloons, it hasn't affected us personally,\" the woman driver told me after the spot check. \"But we live really close to the border and this whole situation really does worry us.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Belarus up to?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The border itself is now marked by a tall metal fence, with a coil of vicious-looking barbed wire on top and more beyond. Below are giant concrete blocks marking the line before a Belarusian flag and a border post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this extra security is the most obvious sign of how Lithuania now views its neighbour - and its ally Russia - as hostile and dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not far away in Minsk, the man who has ruled Belarus for three decades, Alexander Lukashenko, dismisses all the talk of hybrid warfare as \"nonsense\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recently blamed \"bandit\" smugglers for the balloons, saying they were just seeking a profit and getting creative about overcoming the new security fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lithuania doesn't buy that, partly because Belarus already has form when it comes to \"hybrid\" attacks on the border. In 2021 migrants trying to reach the EU were helped to cross into Lithuania and Poland in big numbers, provoking a deliberate crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are other signs of state involvement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vilnius, Vilmantas Vitkauskas runs the crisis management centre that brings together various branches of government and security services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before, he says, smugglers would send their balloons in clusters to overwhelm security forces on the other side. \"Now they are doing a sequence of one or two balloons every 30 minutes, aimed directly at the airport,\" he explains in front of a giant digital wall map that charts all the balloons spotted so far this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Lukashenko's Belarus... if they were interested in stopping it they can do it tomorrow. But they don't. That means it benefits them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspicion is that Belarus is trying to bully its way into reducing sanctions.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vilmantas Vitkauskas says if Belarus wanted to stop the balloons, it would</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They want to attract political attention and force us to change our policies towards Belarus,\" is how minister Kestutis Budrys sees the sudden influx of balloons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU doesn't recognise Alexander Lukashenko as president because he imprisoned his main opponents ahead of disputed elections in 2020 and oversaw a brutal crackdown afterwards. The sanctions that were imposed then were tightened two years later when he helped Vladimir Putin launch Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First, they want to end the international isolation of the regime and number two, of course, the sanctions,\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has just<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> agreed to lift some sanctions on Belarus,</a> with the country afterwards freeing 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Budrys argues for a harder line with Minsk from Europe. \"We have to expand the sanctions regime against Belarus to include hybrid activities against the EU,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was done with Russia, but not with Belarus.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disruption and delays</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, travellers to and from Lithuania – and the airlines – are having to adapt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is something completely new for the aviation sector, none of the airports in Europe experienced that,\" airport CEO Simonas Bartkus says, inside a shiny new terminal in Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One airline has already relocated its charter flights to Lithuania's second city and another has cut its evening flight service to Vilnius. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bartkus estimates the loss of revenue for all affected businesses will reach €2m by the end of the year. \"One thing is the extra cost for us and the airlines, but the even higher risk is if passengers start to lose trust in air travel,\" he admits.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Martynas (right) says Nato is being tested - \"And we can't even fight simple balloons\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Already, travellers check a new webpage that gives the wind forecast and the likelihood of balloons floating into their flight path before booking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not easy, it makes me a little bit nervous. I'd just like to get home as planned,\" a Polish passenger said, as he waited in the terminal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the last week we were checking every day,\" a local woman, Justina, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We believe this is a hybrid attack on us. I think for them it's really funny to fly those balloons and then laugh at us, not dealing with it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her words hint that another aim of hybrid activity attacks - sowing discontent and political division - is also working, and perhaps harder to defend against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're basically testing the limits of Nato: looking how we protect against these kinds of things,\" says her partner, Martynas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we can't even fight, like, simple balloons.

A synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne last year, a Jewish MP's office was vandalised and a car was torched in Sydney. A childcare centre in Sydney was also set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two Australian nurses were suspended and charged this year after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.

But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images US President Donald Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin \n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with Russia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind?

Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WPA Pool/Getty Images (left to right) British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday.
