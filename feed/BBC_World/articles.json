an accusation India denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin's visit comes as the US holds a series of talks with Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to broker a peace deal to end the war. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Putin told India Today that Russia was working on a \"peaceful solution\" to ending the war -

a move the Indian government called \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" at the time.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his interview with India Today, Putin commented on the US tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, and said that India should have the same opportunities available as the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The United States itself still buys nuclear fuel from us for its own nuclear power plants.

The form will be mandatory for men and voluntary for women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90  cities on Friday to protest against the move.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many young Germans either oppose the new law or are sceptical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't want to spend half a year of our lives locked up in barracks, being trained in drill and obedience and learning to kill,\" the organisers of the protests wrote in a statement posted on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"War offers no prospects for the future and destroys our livelihoods.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Universal medical examinations were necessary, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, so that in the event of an attack, Germany would not waste time determining \"who is operationally capable as a homeland protector and who is not\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, currently have around 182,000 service personnel, and Pistorius wants to increase that number by 20,000 over the next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The long-term aim is to raise the number by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists, to meet new Nato force targets and strengthen Germany's defences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the plan is for voluntary service, if the security situation worsens or if too few volunteers came forward, a form of compulsory military service could be considered by the Bundestag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like other European countries, Germany ran down its armed forces during the peacetime years of the 1990s. During the Cold War it had an army of almost half a million.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compulsory military service in Germany was ended in 2011 under former chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But now, in the face of perceived threats from Russia and heavy pressure from Germany's traditional ally, the US, Friedrich Merz has pledged to rebuild the Bundeswehr into Europe's strongest conventional army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato countries have come under pressure from US President Donald Trump's White House to increase their spending on defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Incentives for voluntary service are relatively high, with a promised salary of about €2,600 a month. In France, volunteers will be paid at least €800 (£700) a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Bundestag was also set to vote on Friday on a contentious pensions reform bill, which will keep the state pension at current levels until 2031.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill is a key pillar of the coalition deal between Merz's conservatives and his centre-left partner, the Social Democrats, who have just a slender governing majority of just 12 votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there had been doubts about whether it would pass the parliamentary vote, as  younger members of Merz's conservatives threatened to rebel. They say the plan is financially unsustainable and will leave younger generations shouldering the burden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Germany's opposition far-left Left party said it would abstain from voting, which means the coalition needs fewer votes to pass it and so won't have to worry about potential rebels from its own ranks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government crisis may narrowly have been averted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The equity value, or cash price, is $72bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boards of directors from each company unanimously approved the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael O'Leary, chief executive of trade organisation Cinema United, said the merger posed \"an unprecedented threat\" to the global  cinema business.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix will complete the takeover after Warner Bros finalises its previously announced plans to separate its streaming and studios division from its global networks division into two companies next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its global networks division will become Discovery Global and will include its cable channels such as CNN and TNT Sports in the US, as well as its Discovery and free-to-air channels in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, TNT Sports International will stay with the streaming and studios division being sold to Netflix.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Hollywood shake-up</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight, said the sale was \"a huge statement of intent and underlines Netflix aspirations to be a global leader in the new world order of streaming\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he warned that while the \"surprising move\" made sense for Warner Bros, it could \"provide a headache for Netflix\" when trying to combine the companies given the size of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the agreed deal is for part of the Warner Bros business, rival Paramount had tabled a bid to buy the whole company, including its cable networks, in October. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros rejected this move before putting itself up for sale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the announcement of the deal, Tom Harrington, head of television at Enders Analysis, said it was hard to gauge whether the takeover would be approved by regulators, but if it went through it would have a massive impact on cinema.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Were it to go through it would reorient Hollywood,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Harrington said there was likely to be \"big reductions\" in television and film output from a newly-merged company, which would lead to resistance to the move from parts of Hollywood and relevant unions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For consumers, Mr Harrington said a merger was likely to lead to higher prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Netflix would get more expensive and even though HBO Max would be shuttered/become non-essential, the greater penetration of Netflix households would likely mean an increase in total overall subscription revenues.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Netflix had \"offered an olive branch\" to Hollywood with the promise it would continue to release Warner Bros films on the big screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If this deal can clear those significant regulatory hurdles quickly there are likely to be considerable cost savings to be made,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"How much of those savings get passed to streaming platform subscribers or whether Netflix will be seen to have too much pricing power is one of the areas that will face a huge amount of scrutiny in the coming months.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-by-natalie-sherman\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With additional reporting by Natalie Sherman</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But this did little to dampen the US president's rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the beginning of the event at the newly-renamed Donald J Trump Institute of Peace, Trump said the peace ceremony was a \"great day\" for Africa and the world, later branding it \"historic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a lot of confidence in both leaders,\" Trump added, with journalists noting he had mispronounced the names of both central African presidents. \"We'll keep these commitments. I know they're going to keep them and follow through on the agreement and create a much brighter future for the people of their countries.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump got the two countries' foreign ministers to sign a peace accord in June, hailing it as a \"glorious triumph\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of other African leaders also attended the ceremony, including those of Kenya, Angola, Burundi and Togo, as well as the vice-president of Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the event, Kagame praised Trump as an \"even-handed\" leader who is \"never taking sides\". Rwanda's president described Trump's approach as pragmatic and said that \"as a result, we have the clearest and most viable path forward that we have ever had\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tshisekedi expressed \"deep gratitude and clear hope\", while at the same time saying he hoped Rwanda would \"respect the letter and spirit of the deal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The foreign ministers of Qatar and the UAE also were in attendance at this signing - which Trump has dubbed the \"Washington Accords\" - as was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a day later, Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe told BBC Newsday he would not commit to withdrawing troops from DR Congo, denying that any are there in the first place. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is nowhere in any deal that states that Rwanda should withdraw its troops, because we don't have any troops in eastern DRC,\" he said.

DR Congo has recently accused Kigali of similar violations, and the UN said Rwandan troops and M23 militia remained on the ground.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 was not present - it is in talks with DR Congo's government in a parallel peace process led by Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration spearheaded the talks between DR Congo and Rwanda,  hoping that resolving their differences would pave the way for the US to increase investments in the resource-rich region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the signing ceremony, Trump said the US would send \"some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we're going to take out the rare earth, take out some of the assets, and pay,\" he said. \"Everybody's going to make a lot of money.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts are sceptical about whether the deal will lead to lasting peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A DR Congo researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Bram Verelst, told the BBC that there was \"currently no ceasefire in place, and the M23 rebellion continues to expand and consolidate its control\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The signing ceremony is unlikely to alter this situation, though there is some small hope it could increase accountability on Congolese and Rwandan leaders to honour their commitments,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 seized key cities in eastern DR Congo earlier this year, including Goma and Bukavu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh fighting was reported on Thursday, while on Tuesday, DR Congo army spokesman Gen Sylvain Ekenge said the rebels had launched a fresh offensive on villages in the South Kivu province. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The villages are about 75km (47 miles) from Uvira city, which lies on the border with Burundi and has been the headquarters of the South Kivu regional government since the rebels seized Bukavu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, the M23 said the DR Congo army had launched an air and ground assault against its positions, and this was done in cahoots with Burundian forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has not commented on the allegation.

Authorities are being \"extra careful\" that public anger does not led to a \"recurrence of the 2019 riots\", she told the BBC's Newshour radio programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the questions in the petition and being asked by many Hong Kongers include how the blaze could have swept through the buildings so rapidly and whether any government officials should be held responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have to differentiate genuine expressions of opinion from petitions with criminal intent. That is what our courts will have to find out,\" Ip added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kwan's petition, which listed \"four demands\" - echoing the \"five demands, not one less\" slogan that rallied protesters in 2019 - gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day before it was taken down. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, the city's leader John Lee said Hong Kong would \"go all out\" to support victims and investigate the blaze. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He anounced a number of actions such as the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8ng18p7v3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">convening of an independent committee</a> to investigate the fire, a review of the building works system, and temporary accommodation and financial aid to victims. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of these were what people were calling for already - and they also formed a part of Kwan's petition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's baffling how Miles was [arrested] for asking basic questions on behalf of many residents, which the government went on to address anyway,\" said Samuel Chu, a pro-democracy activist who reposted Kwan's petition on a separate platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not a political campaign.

South Africa, on the other hand, likely has at least four times as much.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main reason why these countries have rapidly growing stockpiles of horns is believed to be the dehorning programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea is that if a rhino does not have a horn, it is of no value to poachers and so won't be killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The horn is removed above the growth plate, just like humans cut their nails, which means it is painless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it also means that the horns grow back and need to be sawed off repeatedly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result their stockpiles are rapidly accumulating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The reason for not destroying the horn is speculative stockpiling, by both governments and private individuals,\" said Mr Tench.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some countries, like Kenya, destroy their rhino horn stockpiles, while others, like Namibia and South Africa, stockpile the horn in the hopes of cashing in if international trade is ever legalised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governments of both countries have been approached for comment.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae4b/live/889c55e0-d1b8-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A Malaysian Wildlife official displays seized rhino horns and other animal parts at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks headquarters in Kuala Lumpur on August 20, 2018. - Malaysia has made a record seizure of 50 rhino horns worth an estimated 12 million US dollars as they were being flown to Vietnam, authorities said on August 20.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Wildlife campaigners say legalising rhino horn trade will fuel demand and that will  increase poaching </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supporters of the rhino horn trade argue that it would generate revenues that could be used to support conservation efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say many private rhino owners in Africa support legalisation because of the high cost of anti-poaching measures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But those opposing the idea of opening up the trade argue that it would stimulate demand that would lead to a significant increase in poaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say the legal trade in rhino horn - especially domestic markets in countries like China and Vietnam - was a primary driver of the rhino poaching crisis of the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rhino populations around the world remain at risk from poaching and the illegal trade continues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Between 2021 and 2023, there were more than 150 rhino horn seizures, with an estimated 1.8 tonnes of horn - the equivalent of 716 whole horns - recovered globally, according to a recent report by Traffic and the IUCN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa accounted for 66% of the seizures by weight, with significant shipments destined for Malaysia and Vietnam, the report said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

organising voting campaigns for their acts, after allegations that Israel unfairly boosted its entrant, Yuval Raphael, this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News understands that voting to accept those measures was tied to a clause whereby members agreed not to proceed with a vote on Israel's participation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This vote means that all EBU Members who wish to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2026 and agree to comply with the new rules are eligible to take part,\" the EBU said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

Both the woman and the doctor risked imprisonment if the conditions were not met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Faroese pro-choice campaigners have argued the legislation was outdated and impinged on women's rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a colossal change,\" Bjørt Lind from pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val told Danish newspaper Politiken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Abortion has been so hidden and taboo in Faroese society. When we started our work, no one dared to talk about it. It has gotten much better,\" she says. \"But it's still a huge challenge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement to the BBC, Amnesty International's Faroe Islands branch said: \"After years of campaigning we finally have a law respecting women's and all pregnant people's rights to a safe and legal abortion until week 12.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a huge step for human rights, the right to bodily autonomy and to secure safe abortions,\"  it added. \"And Faroese women don't have to go on an expensive trip abroad to have an abortion.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With limited access to abortions in the Faroe Islands, campaign groups said women often had to travel to Denmark for the procedure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Danish law has allowed abortion up to 12 weeks since 1973, and in June this year, that was amended to extend terminations on request until 18 weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the Centre for Reproductive Rights, some 43 countries in Europe allow \"abortion on request\" during the early stages of pregnancy. Only five - Andorra, Malta, Liechtenstein, Poland and Monaco - maintain highly restrictive laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those opposed to the law change in the Faroe Islands, argued that the right of the fetus should be protected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against Thursday's bill, told Danish national broadcaster, DR, that he respects the result, but does not believe there is much support for the new law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we will see that some will try to roll it back,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remote archipelago is home to around 56,000 people, who speak Faroese and have a distinct cultural identity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compared to other Nordic countries, society in the Faroe Islands is considered relatively conservative, with more than three quarters of the population members of the Lutheran church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous attempts to liberalise abortion laws have failed. Most recently, in May last year, an almost identical bill resulted in a tied vote, failing to secure the majority required to pass the Faroese parliament.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It dismissed as \"misleading\" reports that he was killed by Hamas, which had accused him of collaborating with Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier statement from Abu Shabab's Bedouin tribe, the Tarabin, said he had been killed \"at the hands of the resistance\", and accused him of betraying the Palestinian people.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other sources said his death was the result of an internal power struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Hamas statement said the \"fate that befell\" Abu Shabab was \"the inevitable fate of all who betray their people and homeland and are content to be tools in the hands of the occupation [Israel]\", without claiming involvement in his killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's Army Radio cited a security source as saying that Abu Shabab had died of his wounds after being evacuated to Soroka hospital in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. But the hospital denied that he died under their care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement from the Popular Forces pledged to continue on Abu Shabab's \"path until the last terrorist is eliminated from the soil of Gaza and a bright and secure future is built for our people, who believe in peace\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was arming Palestinian clans in Gaza that he said were opposed to Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It came after Israeli media reported that he had authorised the supply of weapons to the Popular Forces. However, the militia denied that it was being armed by Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Popular Forces have been accused of looting humanitarian aid trucks sent into Gaza during the war, which the militia has also denied. Reports in Israel have also suggested that two of its members have previous links to the Islamic State group (IS).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began almost eight weeks ago, Abu Shabab had reportedly been one of several anti-Hamas militia leaders jostling for position in the second phase of US President Donald Trump's Gaza peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would involve setting up an interim government, deploying an international stabilisation force, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, and the disarmament of Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the first phase, Hamas agreed to return all 48 living and dead hostages it was still holding in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails, as well as a partial Israeli withdrawal and a surge in humanitarian aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The body of one dead Israeli hostage is yet to be returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's government has previously said it would not join talks on the second phase until Hamas has returned all the hostages. However, Trump said on Wednesday that the second phase was \"going to happen pretty soon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 70,120 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were not in the position to continue their mission in any way,\" Himes said. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Lawmakers react to boat strike video showed in classified briefing</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the briefing, Representative Adam Smith, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, released a joint statement with Himes calling for the video to be released publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The briefing left us with more questions than answers, and Congress must continue to investigate this matter and conduct oversight,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican Senator Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Adm Bradley and Hegseth \"did exactly what we would expect them to do\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I saw two survivors trying to flip a boat loaded with drugs bound to the United States back over so they could stay in the fight,\" Cotton said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican House Representative Rick Crawford also defended the strikes and said there was \"no doubt in my mind\" that they were done in a way that was professional.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat, said in a statement he was \"disturbed\" by what he saw, adding that his party would continue to investigate the incident. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The revelation there were two strikes when the first left survivors has raised new questions over the legality of the administration's deadly ongoing campaign against boats, due to what the rules of conflict say about targeting wounded combatants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump has said he has \"no problem\" with video of the second strike being made public. Footage of the first strike has already been released. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the incident, two survivors of the first strike tried to climb back onto the boat before the vessel was hit a second time, US media including CBS reported. A source said the pair appeared to be trying to salvage drugs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adm Bradley was also expected to tell the high-ranking US lawmakers on Thursday that the survivors were a legitimate target because their boat was still thought to contain drugs, according to a US official who spoke to the Reuters news agency.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2 September incident was the first in a series of ongoing US attacks against vessels that have left more than 80 people dead in both the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While US officials have insisted the 2 September attack was lawful, a full picture is still emerging of what happened that day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Washington Post was the first last week to report that two people had survived the first strike, and that Hegseth had allegedly ordered a second attack to kill them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, Hegseth immediately condemned the reporting as \"fabricated, inflammatory and derogatory\", while Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the \"entire narrative was false\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The existence of a second strike was later confirmed by the White House. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week the order came not from Hegseth but from Adm Bradley, who acted \"well within his authority and the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Hegseth said he had watched the initial strike as it took place before moving on to other meetings. He said he \"did not personally see survivors\", which he attributed to the flaming wreckage and \"the fog of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later that day, the defence secretary recalled, he was informed that Adm Bradley decided to \"sink the boat and eliminate the threat\", a move he considered justified.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"I did not personally see survivors\", Hegseth says of second deadly boat strike</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue has drawn concern from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike, many of whom had already criticised the military campaign more generally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as the lethal strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats, the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela itself has repeatedly condemned the strikes, and has accused the White House of stoking tensions in the region with the aim of toppling the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has claimed that the strikes have led to a massive reduction in drug trafficking through maritime routes, without providing evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Evidence that the targeted individuals in each case were drug traffickers has likewise not been publicly provided.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on survivors on 2 September could be considered legal under international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court (ICC) previously told the BBC that US air strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9kgqwnk8wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">would be treated under international law as crimes against humanity.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These are criminals, not soldiers. Criminals are civilians,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has cast its operations in the Caribbean as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adm Bradley is yet to give any public comment on the matter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the dozens of people who have been killed in the ongoing US strikes is believed to be Alejandro Carranza, a Colombian, who was last seen on 14 September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carranza's family have now filed a complaint with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) in Washington, BBC Mundo has confirmed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This was largely due to her pre-war efforts, working with the British Library to preserve, archive and digitise the works. They had been stored in acid-free boxes and kept in iron safes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some pieces we recovered looked as if they hadn't spent 700 days under the rubble,\" comments Ms Amsi. \"But others came out looking as if a child had simply torn them to pieces.\" To illustrate, she holds up a box of charred scraps covered in Arabic calligraphy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, Ms Amsi's team was able to use heavy equipment to uncover more badly damaged manuscripts. She says it is now clear that the library's archive - seen as an invaluable record of Palestinian history, with many Ottoman records - was totally burned.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gaza's history stretches back more than 5,000 years and many civilisations have left their mark</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palestinians accuse Israel of deliberately targeting their heritage sites - a war crime.

India is the world's fastest growing major economy.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was happy. Washington less so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dxr1g4y7yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an additional 25% tariff</a> on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's geopolitics at play, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn0r02zgjj4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">smiling and chatting together</a> sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a \"multi-polar world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia lauds its \"no limits partnership\" with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is just as vocal about its \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,\" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian S400 drives on their way to Red Square during the general rehearsal of Victory Day military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, at Red Square in Moscow, Russia on 7 May 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Weapon sales to India are a priority for Russia</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Test of Modi's strategic autonomy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"by-vikas-pandey\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"by-vikas-pandey\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">By Vikas Pandey</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was India's \"strategic autonomy\" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15lqe7v302o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an all-time low</a> in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his \"true friend\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/international/world-wants-the-ukraine-war-to-end-but-russia-doesnt-seem-serious-about-peace/articleshow/125675348.cms\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">joint article</a> in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,\" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21, 2025 in Washington, DC\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India as penalty for buying Russian oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somali-Americans in Minnesota have described their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" said Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also expressed concerns of violence that could follow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here\", that could encourage others to become \"more radicalised\", he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in Minnesota's social assistance programme.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\"

government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/07/17/a-somali-american-investigator-heres-why-youre-hearing-so-much-about-fraud-in-my-community/\"

represent a small fraction of Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The House Oversight Committee said on Wednesday it was opening an investigation into Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's handling of the allegations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Anyone who looks like me is scared' </h2></p><div

naturalised citizen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now,\" he told CBS News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of the fraud allegations that Trump has repeatedly referenced in his criticism of the Somali community, Osman said: \"My community is upset. Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders. That operation began on Wednesday,  according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/397b/live/6bea5c60-d08e-11f0-9508-4b2ee64d533f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Abdilatif Hassan Kowsar Mohamed poses for a photo\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Abdilatif Hassan</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kowsar Mohamed says Trump's comments have led to increased concern</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) is already here,\" said Kowsar Mohamed, who lives in south Minneapolis.

At least, not right now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But cars need fuel (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Tuesday they claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.

When I ask whether that means giving up her home for good, she replies, \"in this situation, yes\". They're already making plans to rebuild their lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some soldiers sent to the Donbas are also voting with their feet. There have been nearly 300,000 cases of desertion, or soldiers going  absent without official leave, since the start of Russia's full scale invasion - and numbers have risen dramatically over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them is Serhii - not his real name. We met him in hiding. His home has become his prison as he tries to evade arrest. Serhii volunteered to fight at the start of the year, whereas most of the men in his unit were forcibly mobilised - \"taken off the street\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says his unit was already below strength when it was sent to the front, near Pokrovsk, and they weren't properly trained or equipped. \"I ended up in a battalion where everything was a mess,\" he says, although he still believes this was the exception, not the norm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii deserted in May after two of his friends went awol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't have gone if we had proper leadership and someone experienced in charge,\" he says. \"I came to serve, not to run\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii is still thinking about his next move, and the possibility of returning to the army.

The West African country has experienced at least nine attempted and successful coups since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when military officers announced they had seized control of the country last Wednesday, some analysts and political figures were sceptical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All the typical ingredients for a coup were there: gunfire was heard near the presidential palace, the President - Umaro Sissoco Embaló - was arrested and soldiers gave an address on state television.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, other circumstances have been called into question, with Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan joining a chorus of voices who believe the takeover was masterminded by Embaló himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And to complicate matters further, the military insisted to the BBC that it had taken over the country, but condemned the use of the word \"coup\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The junta leaders said they were acting to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country, which has become known as a drug-trafficking hub.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the lead-up to the coup?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just three days before the military takeover, Bissau-Guineans voted in a presidential election.
