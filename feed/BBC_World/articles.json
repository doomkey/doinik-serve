But also, so they can put something to one side to buy a little land on which we can eventually build a house, maybe buy a car,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since President Trump took office, Marcos says he only keeps the very minimum he needs for rent and food in the US.

They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That ceasefire agreement collapsed <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7l0rjz05eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">earlier this month</a>, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk15x85jlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

While authorities are still searching for the perpetrators, jihadist group Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah said it was behind the explosion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mosque is in the Wadi al-Dhahab neighbourhood, where most people are part of the Alawite ethnoreligious group. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria's Foreign Ministry condemned the \"terrorist crime\", writing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/syrianmofaex/status/2004528801397801185/photo/1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in a statement on X</a> that the \"cowardly act is a blatant assault on human and moral values\" designed to \"undermine the security and stability\" of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah, a Sunni extremist group, has said it carried out the attack in collaboration with another unidentified group, using explosives planted at the site.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group's vague origins and opaque affiliations, which came to prominence in June when it said it was behind <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c307n9p43z9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a deadly church bombing in Damascus</a>, have raised questions about its true links and authenticity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some observers have speculated that it could be a front for Islamic State group (IS) given the similarity in their messaging and type of targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest claim follows a months-long lull in Saraya Ansar al-Sunnah's claimed attacks, which have largely taken the form of alleged targeted killings of minorities and what the group describes as \"remnants\" of the former Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The blast comes a year after Syrian rebel forces overthrew Assad, who is Alawite. The sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam whose members make up one of the country's biggest religious minorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, Syria has seen several waves of sectarian violence, with Alawites fearing reprisals and being subject to crackdowns. Assad fled to Russia, an ally of his regime, where he and his family have been given asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czxnwrqey4go\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security forces were accused of killing dozens of Alawites</a> in the coastal province of Latakia, war monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-bbc-monitoring\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring </i></p></div></div></body></html>"

But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this is good news for the Russian president.

They were told his Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second-largest at the time, would be nationalised unless all ties to its founder were cut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't discuss the price,\" Tinkov told the New York Times. \"It was like a hostage - you take what you are offered.

It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chris Graythen/Getty Images A man wearing a white baseball cap and grey T-shirt grins while standing under a tree\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Oleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK.

Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the years that followed showed that immense benefits were to be reaped from being part of Putin's war economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. It was good for even those among Russia's ultra-rich who were not making billions directly out of defence contracts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's not even counting those who aren't directly involved, but do need a relationship of sorts with the Kremlin. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While allowing loyalists to profit, Putin has consistently punished those who have refused to toe the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russians remember all too well what happened to oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP Russia's richest man and oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky is seen in his cage in &quot;Matroska tishina&quot; prison on a TV screen during a video-link in the courthouse in Moscow, 15 January 2003\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalised</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If any of them had considered defecting to the West with their billions, the sanctions made that impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was absolutely no plan, no idea, no clear path for any of them to jump ship.

And it has since spread to protests across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a lot going on with that little inflatable frog,\" says LM Bogad, a professor at University of California, Davis and a Guggenheim Fellow who specialises in performance art.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">From Pepe to Portland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's hard to talk about protests and frogs without talking about Pepe, a cartoon character embraced by far-right groups during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the meme first took off online, the image was used to signal certain emotions. Later, it was deployed to show support for Trump, including one notable meme retweeted by Trump himself, depicting Pepe with Trump's signature suit and hair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe was also depicted in right-wing online communities on 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit in darker contexts, as Adolf Hitler or a member of the violent white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. Online conservatives traded \"rare Pepes\" and set up cryptocurrency in his name. His catchphrase, \"feels good, man\", was deployed as an inside joke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe didn't start out so controversial.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its creator, artist Matt Furie, has been vocal about his distaste for how the image has been used. Pepe was supposed to be simply a \"chill frog-dude\" in this artist's universe of characters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog first appeared in a series of comics in 2005 - apolitical and best known for pulling his pants all the way down to pee. In the 2020 documentary Feels Good Man, which chronicles Mr Furie's efforts to wrest back control of his work, he said his Pepe drawing was inspired by his experiences with friends and roommates in his 20s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early in his career, Mr Furie experimented with uploading his work to the nascent social web, where other users began to borrow, remix and reinvent his character. As Pepe spread into the more extreme corners of the internet, Mr Furie tried to disavow the frog, even killing him off in a comic strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe lived on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It shows you that we don't control symbols,\" says Prof Bogad. \"They can change and shift and be reworked.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, the popularity of Pepe meant that frogs were largely associated with the right. But that changed on 2 October, when a confrontation between a protestor dressed in an inflatable frog costume with a blue neck scarf and an immigration officer in Portland, Oregon, went viral.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Protesters in frog suit and chicken suits stand outside the ICE centre\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The moment came just days after Trump ordered the National Guard to Portland, calling the city \"war-ravaged\". Protesters began to gather in droves on a single block, just outside of an immigration enforcement facility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions were high and an immigration officer sprayed a chemical agent at a protester, aiming directly into the air intake fan of the puffy frog costume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protester, Seth Todd, responded with a joke, saying he had tasted \"spicier tamales\". But the incident went viral.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Todd's attire was not too unusual for Portland, known for its quirky culture and left-wing protests that revel in the absurd - public yoga and 80s-style aerobics lessons, and nude cycling groups. The city's unofficial motto is \"Keep Portland Weird\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog even played a role in the ensuing legal battle between the Trump administration and the city, which argued the National Guard deployment was unlawful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the court ruled in October that Trump had the right to deploy troops, one judge dissented, referencing in her minority ruling the protesters' \"well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods deployed by ICE\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Judge Susan Graber wrote. \"But today's decision is not merely absurd.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's deployment was \"permanently\" blocked by courts just a month later, and troops have reportedly departed the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by then, the frog had become a potent anti-administration symbol for the left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The costume was spotted across the country at No Kings protests last autumn. There were frogs - and unicorns and axolotls and dinosaurs - in San Diego and Atlanta and Boston. They were in small towns like Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and big international cities like Tokyo and London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog costume was backordered on Amazon, and rose in price.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Controlling the optics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What brings both frogs together - Pepe and the Portland frog - is the interplay between the humorous, benign cartoon amphibian and a deeper political meaning. This is what political scientists call \"tactical frivolity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy rests on what Mr Bogad calls the \"irresistible image\" - often silly, it's a \"disarming and charming\" display that calls attention to your ideas without obviously explaining them to a viewer. It's the goofy costume you wear, or the symbol you draw, or the meme you share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bogad is both an expert in the subject and a veteran practitioner himself. He's written a book on the subject, called Tactical Performance: The Theory and Practice of Serious Play, and taught workshops around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could go back to the Middle Ages - when people are dominated, they use absurdity to speak the truth a little bit and still have plausible deniability.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea of this approach is three-fold, Mr Bogad says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As protesters take on a powerful opposition, a silly costume takes control of the optics. \"It makes it look worse if you respond with violence,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Second, an image can set a certain tone for those within the movement and would-be supporters. In the case of Portland, \"it was like a radical costume ball and we all got invited,\" Mr Bogad said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, this kind of tactic can offer political cover for criticism. Sometimes that shows up in claims of political memes as \"just a joke\" - a defence against critics who would brand your views as dangerous. But it's especially useful in circumstances where government criticism can be dangerous, Mr Bogad says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests</figcaption></p></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A protester in a frog costume holds a subway sandwich and wears a sticker that says No Kings\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The costumes have been frequently seen at protests in Washington DC</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He points to Otpor, the Serbian pro-democracy protest movement that supported efforts to overthrow Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 through pranks and street comedy. For years, critics of Chinese President Xi Jinping have shared images of Winnie the Pooh to signal their opposition online, where more bold-faced criticism could face censorship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have also embraced Pepe, unaware of his political affiliations in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, authoritarians don't like to be laughed at,\" he says. This kind of symbolism works because \"without even giving a speech, you are undermining the authoritarian script\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home in Oregon, a group of Portlanders doubled down on the viral fame and banded together to form \"Operation Inflation\", which collects and distributes inflatable costumes to protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They started a website where supporters can donate $35 to buy suits \"for community members to wear at ICE protest sites to help deflate (pun intended) the tensions surrounding protests\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brooks Brown, a co-founder of Operation Inflation, says the point is to \"shift the story that's being told\", by the Trump administration, that all protesters are part of a violent mob.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our job is to build a different stage, and to force them onto ours,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brown says the inflatables bear similarities with the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, when protesters would often dress in their Sunday finest and sit motionless as they were harassed by counter-protesters and arrested by aggressive police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe, Mr Brown says, \"was a fascist symbol for 4chan.

Using what he had learned at Berklee and combining it with Ethiopian modes, he \"created this science called Ethio-jazz\", Mulatu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially his radical sound was met with complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember them telling me 'get off, stop, stop there'.

Was it the cello or the masenqo?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is we don't do research. We have so many great scientists in Africa. Great people, geniuses, who created all these instruments. But we don't give them credit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, he says his mission is to broaden the range of the traditional instruments of his homeland by \"computerising\" the sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his fans, it is his unique blend of the modern and traditional that makes Ethio-jazz so special.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reminds me a lot of music from South Asia, melded with the pentatonic scale which reminds me more of Arab music, along with the African percussion sounds that come through,\" said concert-goer Joseph Badawi-Crook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a completely unique mix and I just fell in love with it years ago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mulatu's legacy spans generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our grandparents or our parents or our aunts or our uncles, have seen Mulatu throughout his career,\" said London-based Ethiopian fan Solliana Kineferigb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To also be part of the younger generation and to have the opportunity to still see him live is amazing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the touring may be over, Mulatu pledges to continue to bring Ethiopian music to the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not the end,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about African music:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war. Even where voting is taking place, it is marred by a climate of fear and intimidation.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the  election, we were told not to by party officials. They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay. At a market stall selling fresh river fish the customers all refused to answer what they thought of the election. We have no choice, so we have to vote, one said. The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid. Everyone has lost their humanity and their freedom. So many people have died, been tortured or fled to other countries. If the military keeps running the country, how can things change?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would not vote, she said, but she knew that decision carried risks.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lulu Luo/ BBC People walking down the street in Mandalay, past parked two-wheelers.

It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'No-one is ready to compromise'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints.

The abduction was captured on CCTV and gripped the nation for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high court ruled that the elite Special Branch of the police had taken Raymond Koh, and held both the police and the Malaysian government responsible for the country's first-ever enforced disappearance case to be heard in a court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years Ms Liew fought to find out what happened to her husband, transforming from an ordinary pastor's wife to a fierce campaigner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She may never know for sure why her husband was taken, but two independent official investigations found that the police saw the pastor as a threat to Islam, Malaysia's majority religion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC shortly after her court victory, Ms Liew said she was driven to pursue justice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A voice [inside me] said… 'So they took him in secret - I will let the whole world know'.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: CCTV captures moment pastor Raymond Koh is abducted</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 13 February 2017, shortly after 10am, Mr Koh left his family home to meet friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the 63-year-old drove out of his house in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb, a convoy of SUVs and motorcycles roared up to his vehicle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Masked men in black clothing sprang out. Glass shards flew everywhere as they smashed a window of Mr Koh's car and dragged out the pastor. They bundled him into one of their vehicles and drove off, taking his car with them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction took place in seconds. It was so dramatic that one eyewitness driving behind Mr Koh later testified that he thought it was a movie shoot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the following days Mr Koh's children went door to door looking for clues to their father's disappearance - and discovered that two homes' CCTV cameras had captured the entire incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Watching the footage, the family realised it was no ordinary abduction. It was meticulous and well-co-ordinated. They had also not received any ransom note or been contacted by kidnappers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few months before, in November 2016, an activist named Amri Che Mat from the northern state of Perlis had been abducted in almost exactly the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Koh's family went to the media, and the CCTV footage instantly went viral when it was published online by a local newspaper. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The public demanded answers, and Malaysia's human rights commission - an independent body set up by parliament - launched an investigation. Later, there was also a separate investigation by the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many speculated that the Special Branch was responsible. But the police denied involvement, its chief telling the public to \"please shut up\" so they could investigate the disappearance in peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Months later, after conducting their investigations, the police claimed a drug trafficking ring had taken Mr Koh. Separately, they arrested an Uber driver for kidnapping him - a charge that was eventually dropped. Both these leads were later ruled as not credible by the rights commission in the final report of their investigation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Family of Raymond Koh Pastor Raymond Koh smiles at the camera while wearing a dark blue suit and a pink tie, and black-rimmed glasses\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Family of Raymond Koh</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pastor Raymond Koh was taken in 2017 in Kuala Lumpur </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Mr Koh's disappearance took a toll on his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew sold handcrafted jewellery to make ends meet, while relying on her savings and donations to put her youngest daughter through university.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she had expected sympathy from the police. Instead, on the night she reported her husband's disappearance, she said she was questioned for five hours about whether Mr Koh had tried to convert Muslims to Christianity. \"I was very traumatised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her interrogator later testified during the rights commission's investigation hearing that he had been instructed by his supervisors to pursue this line of inquiry because Mr Koh was a pastor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011 Mr Koh had been accused of apostasy - a crime in Muslim-majority Malaysia - when he organised a party at a church which some Muslims also attended. He was investigated by Islamic authorities but no action was taken. He and his family have always denied that he was trying to convert Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years after Mr Koh's disappearance, Ms Liew said, she felt that \"the police were not forthcoming with their investigation and even, at times, they were hindering us from finding out the truth and produced red herrings\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family has long maintained the police's theories were attempts to cover up their role in his abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the Malaysian police for a response to these allegations. They have yet to reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the search for answers dragged on, everyone in the family began experiencing depression, Ms Liew said. She still suffers from panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, there was a breakthrough.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The car and the confession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late one night in May 2018, a man showed up at the house of Norhayati, the wife of Amri Che Mat, the<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>activist who had been abducted in 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Identifying himself as a police sergeant, he<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>delivered shocking information: the Special Branch had indeed kidnapped her husband and Raymond Koh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police believed Mr Koh was trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, he said, and that Amri Che Mat was spreading Shia Islam, which is banned in Sunni-dominant Malaysia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police sergeant said he wanted to tell Ms Norhayati what happened, as he felt what the Special Branch did was wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati's account of this confession was investigated by the human rights commission and eventually ruled as credible. While the sergeant later denied he made the confession, the commission found his denial to be full of inconsistencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, there was the gold-coloured car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness to Mr Koh's abduction recalled seeing a gold-coloured Toyota Vios - a similar car was spotted near Amri Che Mat's house prior to his disappearance. The police sergeant also mentioned a gold-coloured car's presence in both abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators for the rights commission traced that car to a man in Kuala Lumpur who worked for the Special Branch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In April 2019, the commission concluded the Special Branch was responsible for the abductions of Raymond Koh and Amri Che Mat. It said the two men were \"targeted by religious authorities and the police over allegations that they were involved in matters against Islam in Malaysia\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report stunned the Malaysian public, with some demanding accountability. Months later, the government launched its own investigation, which was made public only after Ms Liew and Ms Norhayati sued for access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's investigation came to a similar conclusion, blaming \"irresponsible rogue cops\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its report also named a \"main person of interest\" - a senior Special Branch official, Awaludin bin Jadid, who headed the unit tackling social extremism.

The trust's money, which will be paid out only once Mr Koh's whereabouts are disclosed, will likely go to Ms Liew and her children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati, who also launched a lawsuit, won her case and received several million ringgit in compensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the government is appealing against these verdicts, arguing there are \"issues related to financial obligations\" and that it needs to \"uphold the principle of universal justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also said the police are continuing to investigate the abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the police for comment on the verdict.

But right now, we are in a limbo.

Inspired by counsellors who helped her through her depression, Ms Liew has been training to become one herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Telling her story has also been a \"catharsis\", she said. Over the years, as she travelled the world to raise awareness of her husband's case, she became an outspoken critic of enforced disappearances. In 2020 the US awarded her an International Women of Courage medal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I never expected that I would be at this place. Eight years ago, I was just a housewife and a quiet person,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew has also reached a turning point on a more personal level – she has forgiven the men whom she believes took her husband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the trial, as she watched the lawsuit's defendants take the stand, at first \"I felt like squeezing their necks. I was angry with them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But I noticed that when I came face to face with the main suspect - I felt no hatred… I want to be really right and pure before God, and not have any shadow or darkness in my life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Forgiveness, however, does not mean she will stop her<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>pursuit of justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is now calling for the authorities to set up a disciplinary body to monitor police conduct, as well as a commission of inquiry and a task force to track down every single person involved in her husband's abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, none of the police officials named in her lawsuit have been arrested or punished. One of them has been promoted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we really want is for the truth and justice to prevail, for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, and for us to have good closure,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That means, we want to know where Pastor Raymond is.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A composite image of two pictures of Gen Mamadi Doumbouya.

who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A poster of Mamadi Doumbouya is displayed outside in front of a kiosk where people are watching TV.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4v0599d1no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Doumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre</a> when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">West Africa has been shaken by coups and the breakaway of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from Ecowas, as well as this month's attempted putsch in Benin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government -

She shares clips: eating, doing skin care, putting on lipstick. She even has a cute baby who appears in some videos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after a few seconds, something may seem a little off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She can munch on pizza made out of molten lava, or apply snowflakes and cotton candy as lip gloss. Her hands sometimes pass through what she's holding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's because Gigi isn't real. She's the AI creation of University of Illinois student Simone Mckenzie - who needed to make some money over the summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie, 21, is part of a fast-growing cohort of digital creators who churn out a stream of videos by entering simple prompts into AI chatbots, like Google Veo 3. Experts say this genre, dubbed \"AI slop\" by some critics and begrudging viewers, is taking over social media feeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And its creators are finding considerable success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One video made me $1,600 [£1,185] in just four days,\" Ms Mckenzie said. \"I was like, okay, let me keep doing this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After two months, Gigi had millions of views, making Ms Mckenzie thousands through TikTok's creator fund, a programme that pays creators based on how many views they get. But she's far from the only person using AI to reach easy virality, experts said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's surging right now and it's probably going to continue,\" said Jessa Lingel, associate professor and digital culture expert at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its progenitors - who now can generate videos of literally anything in just a few minutes - have the potential to disrupt the lucrative influencer economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while some say AI is ruining social media, others see its potential to democratise who gains fame online, Lingel said. Those who don't have the money or time for a fancy background, camera setup or video editing tools can now go viral, too.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Simone Mckenzie/Google Veo 3 A young woman, wearing a purple tanktop and a long, black ponytail sits in front of a softly lit background while eating a cookie\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Simone Mckenzie/Google Veo 3</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Part of the prompt McKenzie used to create her most viral video of Gigi</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Traditional influencers being pushed out?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media influencing only recently became a legitimate career path. But in just a few years, the industry has grown to be worth over $250bn, according to investment firm Goldman Sachs. Online creators often use their own lives - their vacations, their pets, their makeup routines - to make content and attract a following.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI creators who can make the same thing - only faster, cheaper and without the constraints of reality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It certainly has the potential to upset the creator space,\" said Brooke Duffy, a digital and social media scholar at Cornell University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie, creator of Gigi, said videos take her only a few minutes to generate and she sometimes posts three per day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's not feasible for human influencers like Kaaviya Sambasivam, 26, who has  around 1.3 million followers across multiple platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Depending on the kind of video she's making - whether it's a recipe, a day-in-my life vlog, or a makeup tutorial - it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to fully produce. She has to shop, plan, set up her background and lighting, shoot and then edit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI creators can skip nearly all of those steps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It bears the question: is this going to be something that we can out compete? Because I am a human. My output is limited,\" Ms Sambasivam, based in North Carolina, said. \"There are months where I will be down in the dumps, and I'll post just the bare minimum. I can't compete with robots.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She started building her channel while living with her parents during the Covid pandemic. Without a set-up, she said she duct-taped her phone to the wall to film. Eventually, she spent money she made as an influencer buying tripods, lighting, makeup and food for her videos. It took years to build her following.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie said she considered being a more traditional influencer, but didn't have the money, time or setup.

She then asked the chatbot to make Gigi talk. Gigi now starts each video chiding commentators who accuse her of being AI. Then, mockingly proving them right, she eats a bedazzled avocado or a cookie made of slime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Duffy said digital alterations aren't new. First, there were programs like Photoshop, used for image editing. Next, apps like FaceTune made it easier for users to change their faces for social media. But she said the main precursor to today's hyper-realistic AI videos were celebrity deepfakes, emerging in the late 2010s.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they now look much, much more real, Ms Duffy said, and they can spread faster.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI videos run the gamut from the absurd - a cartoon of a cat working at McDonald's - to the hyper-realistic, like fake doorbell camera footage. They represent every genre - horror, comedy, culinary. But none of it is real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's become, in some ways, a form of meme culture,\" Ms Duffy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One 31-year-old American woman living in South Korea has a TikTok page dedicated to an AI-generated puppy, Gamja, who wears headphones, cooks and curls his hair. She's received millions of views as well as partnerships from companies who want to be featured in her videos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wanted to blend things that people love, which include food and puppies, in a way that hadn't been done before,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the biggest AI content creators on TikTok is 27-year-old Daniel Riley. He has an audience of millions, but they have never seen his face. Rather, his \"time travel\" videos have earned him nearly 600,000 subscribers and tens of millions of views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"POV: you wake up in Pompeii on eruption day\" and \"POV: you wake up as Queen Cleopatra\" are some of his most popular titles, taking viewers through a 30-second-long fictionalised day in ancient history.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I realised I could tell stories that would normally cost millions to produce and give people a look into different eras through their phone,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he's developed another stream of income - a bootcamp to teach others how to make similar AI videos for a monthly fee.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will anyone know the difference?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Stop calling me AI,\" Gigi says at the beginning of each TikTok. She's arguing with sceptics' - but some audience members unquestioningly believe she's real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one hand, AI videos that are almost indistinguishable from reality pose a real problem,  Ms Lingel said, especially for young kids who don't yet have media literacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it'll be almost impossible for an ordinary human to tell the difference soon,\" she said. \"You're going to see a rise in misinformation, you're going to see a rise in scams, you're going to see a rise in content that's just…crappy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other, AI videos can be mesmerising, experts said, offering cartoonish, exaggerated material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's those images and posts that seem to toe the line between reality and duplicity that capture our attention and encourage us to share,\" Ms Duffy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Harvard University study indicated that among AI users between the ages of 14-22, many say they use it to generate things like images and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she said, the question is if human discernment can keep up with rapidly improving technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost every day, the creator of Gamja said she hears from people online, worried about her AI-generated puppy: they think he's eating foods that are unhealthy, they say - because they think they're watching a real dog.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

norms \"regardless of geopolitical circumstances.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,\" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case.</p><p

Some looters target sites that have already been excavated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A cooling tower and chimneys at the NLC Tamil Nadu Power Ltd.

For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/ceew-how-big-is-the-solar-module-recycling-industry-in-india.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">11 million tonnes of solar waste</a> by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,\" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/end-life-management-solar-photovoltaics\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US</a> may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials.

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. The BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm28g5exx09o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">person identified as \"A\"</a> stands out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told.

This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">DoJ says alleged Epstein letter to Nassar is fake</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Larry Nassar from the shoulders up, wearing square framed glasses with wire rims and orange jumpsuit, looks off to his left\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Larry Nassar</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter included in the released batch of documents has gained plenty of attention online. But, according to the DoJ, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home.

It was also postmarked on 13 August 2019, three days after Epstein died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before the DoJ declared the letter to be fake, questions had been asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The return sender was listed as \"J Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" - but the correct name for the now-shuttered jail was Metropolitan Correctional Center.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents released on Tuesday also show the analysis request by the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A FBI laboratory request stated that in August 2019, a sender listed as \"J Epstein\" at \"Manhattan Correctional\" tried to send a letter to \"Larry Nassar at 9300 S Wilmot Road, Tucson, Arizona, 85756\", the address of a federal prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nassar is currently incarcerated in Pennsylvania, according to the Bureau of Prisons.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trump's alleged travels on Epstein's jet</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fe0/live/c89a2780-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A younger unsmiling Donald Trump wears a suit with red tie.

Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her.

But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage Rupert Murdoch (R) and daughter Elisabeth Murdoch attend the Cheltenham Festival \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'James and Rupert will never patch up differences'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable.

Driven by fears over the more liberal direction they might want the companies to take after his death, the media mogul tried to change the terms of a trust that gave his four oldest children equal control when he dies.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images (L-R) James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch from 1987\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father Rupert and older brother Lachlan now appears irreconcilable (L-R, James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch actually lost the first round of their court fight.

They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years.

They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US Vice President JD Vance speaks during the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast at the Walter E.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect.
