The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z615y443o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security guarantees for 15 years</a> - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Russian Defence Ministry A Russian defence ministry official sits in front of a large screen which shows a map, marked with the the alleged flight paths of the drones Russia says Ukraine launched at one of Putin's residences.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Russian Defence Ministry</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming -

That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is one of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c776xgex02jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">most expensive countries</a> in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The economic slowdown, partly brought on by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51nyglznm6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">property crisis that has hit savings</a>, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when subway fares increase.

Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It added that \"even in the past their combined contribution amounted to only about 1% of the total aid volume\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The diaspora affairs ministry said the primary reason INGOs had their licences revoked was \"the refusal to provide complete and verifiable information regarding their employees,\" which it said was critical to preventing \"the infiltration of terrorist operatives into humanitarian structures\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fewer than 15% of the INGOs providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza were found to be in violation of the new regulatory framework, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That framework includes several grounds for rejection, including:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Denying the Holocaust or the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Supporting an armed struggle against Israel by an enemy state or terrorist organisation</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Promoting \"delegitimisation campaigns\" against Israel</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Calling for a boycott of Israel or committing to participate in one</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Supporting the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign or international courts</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ministry of diaspora affairs also alleged that Israeli investigations had \"determined that individuals affiliated with [Médecins Sans Frontières] were linked to terrorist organisations, including the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas\", without providing any evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Despite repeated requests, the organisation failed to provide full disclosure regarding the identities and roles of these individuals,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MSF said it took such allegations extremely seriously and that it would \"never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any employee who engages in military activity would pose a danger to our staff and our patients. Publicly making such claims without substantiated evidence puts humanitarian staff at risk and undermines life-saving medical work,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MSF also warned that deregistration by Israeli authorities would effectively block it from operating in Gaza, \"where we support one in five hospital beds and one in three births, cutting off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands of people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/30/nx-s1-5661566/an-aid-group-that-has-worked-in-gaza-for-years-responds-to-israels-ban\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Norwegian Refugee Council spokeswoman Shaina Low told NPR that it would no longer be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza</a> if it was deregistered, but that its 200 local staff would continue to support communities as best as they could.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Low said NRC had tried to explain to the Israeli authorities why it could not provide them with lists of their Palestinian staff members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've seen that hundreds of aid workers were killed over the last two years.

Because we've seen that aid workers are just as unprotected, and at times, have been targeted by Israeli authorities,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also said that the NRC and other INGOs were prevented by data protection laws from complying with an Israeli demand to share details about the funding they received from the EU and EU member states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number one thing that we're concerned about is the entry of aid,\" she added. \"We continue to call for Israel to lift these restrictions, to open all of the crossings to allow much more aid to enter than the current rate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is meeting its obligations in facilitating an increase in aid deliveries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 19 December, UN-backed food security experts said there had been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since the ceasefire began, but that 100,000 people still experienced \"catastrophic conditions\" last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other INGOs to be suspended include CARE, Medico International, and Medical Aid for Palestinians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International Rescue Committee said it was in touch with relevant authorities and seeking a way to sustain the delivery of life-saving aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam's policy lead, meanwhile said Cogat's figures on aid deliveries by the affected INGOs were misleading because \"humanitarian impact is not measured by percentages\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not simply aid volume contributors; we are core implementers. The UN relies on our staff, our partners, our technical expertise, our logistics, and our community networks to deliver assistance,\" she explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Humanitarian Country Team of the Occupied Palestinian Territory - a forum that brings together UN agencies and more than 200 local and international NGOs - urged the Israeli authorities to reconsider the registration decisions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, it complained that the new registration system relied on \"vague, arbitrary, and highly politicised criteria and imposes requirements that humanitarian organisations cannot meet without violating international legal obligations or compromising core humanitarian principles\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: \"The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome - the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He was also found guilty under a separate colonial-era law of publishing seditious material in his now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Lai's conviction earlier this month, the UK condemned it as \"politically motivated persecution\", saying that he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their statement earlier this month, Chinese authorities said Western attempts \"to influence judicial verdicts through political pressure blatantly trample on the spirit of the rule of law and fully expose their hypocritical 'double standards'.

She was dubbed an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to participate in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For several years, along with her bitter political rival Sheikh Hasina, she fought for democracy and against military dictatorship, enduring arrests.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was talk among Bangladesh's rulers at the time to keep the two \"battling begums\" - Zia and Hasina - out of politics in what was then known as the \"minus two formula\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Zia eventually became prime minister, first in 1991 then again in 2001. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the time of the military-backed caretaker government in 2007, she was kept under detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last 16 years, under Hasnina's Awami League government, Zia emerged as the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule which many saw as <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz733dly2ero\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">increasingly autocratic</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia's resilience drew admiration from her supporters, who say that despite various personal and political setbacks, years in opposition and convictions under Hasina's government, Zia never gave up, refused to compromise on her principles and stood her ground.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that hundreds of thousands of people, including those who didn't vote for her party, turned up for the funeral would be seen as a reflection of her popularity among the masses. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those who worked with her recall a leader who asked probing questions while making key decisions. As economist Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya noted, she left a lasting impression as  \"a political leader who appreciated ideas and valued informed decision-making\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her later years, she suffered from multiple health problems.

But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power goes - by implication to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Washington Post via Getty Images A man wheels a barrow towards a dumpster on a road that is overlooked by the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on the Russian controlled southern bank side of the Dnipro river\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Washington Post via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other sticking points that could derail deal</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that.

Black-browed albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird-scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird-scaring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird-scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird-scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird-scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Sadly, Stone's career stalled in the mid-1970s as a result of drug abuse, and at one point he was reported to have been left homeless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g2d5yz1r1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Read more</a></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Brian Wilson</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Brian Wilson is positioned behind a microphone stand, wearing a light-coloured shirt with a bold paisley pattern in shades of blue and gray.
