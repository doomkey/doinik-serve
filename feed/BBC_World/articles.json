Police said it was their actions that had given him a shot at survival, local media reported. He is currently in intensive care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The actions of his mates... have been nothing but brave. [It was] a gallant recovery,\" said Joseph McNulty, who leads the state of New South Wales' marine area command.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Very confronting injuries for those boys to see, but I suppose that's mateship.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marine police arrived to a \"horrendous scene\", McNulty told reporters. They pulled the boy onto a police speedboat and used tourniquets to try and stop the bleeding from his legs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also tried to resuscitate the boy as the boat made its way to an ambulance waiting by a wharf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities believe the boy was attacked by a bull shark, an aggressive species found in warm, shallow waters. Many experts consider bull sharks among the most dangerous sharks in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">McNulty believes heavy rainfall over the weekend and brackish water conditions could have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for Sunday's attack. Rain flushes nutrients into the rivers and oceans which can draw sharks closer to shore. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The final attack, in Sydney's Northern Beaches, prompted police to close all beaches in the area until further notice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to police, emergency services were alerted to the third attack after a surfer was pulled from the water at North Steyne Beach, Manly, at 18:20 local time (07:20 GMT). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had suffered serious injuries to his legs, and was rushed to hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia, which is home to some of the world's best beaches, is also one of the deadliest places for shark attacks. There were at least <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz68lglg5vlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">five fatal shark attacks</a> in the country last year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had \"ended seven unendable wars\" on his own and the UN \"did not even try to help in any of them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN was \"extremely engaged\" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. \"But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He suggested the UN Security Council -

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been elected as prime minister by lawmakers on 21 October, Takaichi is now seeking a public mandate in the House of Representatives, the more powerful house in Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the day she took office, Takaichi said, she has been \"constantly concerned that the Takaichi cabinet has not yet been tested in an election where the public chooses the government\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,\" she told the news conference.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Campaigning for the vote to elect the 465 lower house MPs, who serve four-year terms, starts on 27 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has governed Japan almost continuously since 1955. It currently has 199 seats - including three held by its independent partners - in the House of Representatives, the most of any party. The LDP's coalition with the Japan Innovation party gives it a fragile majority, with just enough seats to govern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A protege of former conservative PM Shinzo Abe and self-professed admirer of Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known as Japan's \"Iron Lady\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She came into office promising an economic upturn after years of stagnation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi is an advocate of heavy government-led spending to drive economic growth - a revival of the sort of stimulus measures that Japan saw under \"Abenomics\". Her first few months in office have seen soaring personal poll ratings - no Japanese PM has been popular since Abe, in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, her cabinet approved a record defence budget of nine trillion yen ($57bn; £43bn). This comes amid growing concern over China, with Tokyo describing its neighbour's military activities in the region as its \"greatest strategic challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi has found herself the target of China's ire since last November, when she <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crklvx2n7rzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">made comments</a> suggesting that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. The diplomatic spat that ensued has sent bilateral ties plunging to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Takaichi has pursued closer ties with the US. During US President Donald Trump's visit to Japan last October, the two leaders heaped praise on each other and signed a deal on rare earths. They also signed a document heralding a new \"golden age\" of US-Japan relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opinion polls show that while the LDP remains broadly unpopular among Japanese residents, Takaichi and her government have charted approval ratings of 60-80%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This popularity is what Takaichi hopes can help the LDP secure a \"sole majority\" in parliament and push through bolder policies more easily, Dr Seijiro Takeshita, a management professor at the University of Shizuoka, told the BBC World Service's Asia Specific podcast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She wants to solidify her position to make things smoother at a later stage,\" Takeshita said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the snap election gamble comes with its own set of risks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The LDP's leadership has been on shaky ground, and Takaichi is the country's fourth PM in five years. Her predecessors' terms were cut short by falling public support and scandals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her immediate predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, also announced a snap election shortly after taking office - leading to one of the LDP's worst ever results and costing the party its majority in the House of Representatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another challenge looms in the form of a new, consolidated opposition, the Centrist Reform Alliance, which was formed last week by Japan's largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, and the Komeito party, the LDP's former coalition partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi said the dissolution of parliament was being carried out only \"after establishing a thorough system\" which ensures there is no disruption to economic policies affecting livelihoods and rising prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What Takaichi is hoping for is that \"people will trust her to deliver on her promises\", Dr Jeffrey Kingston, an Asian studies professor at Temple University in the US, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her high approval ratings are \"only going to decline so she wants to lock in the benefits of a long honeymoon\", he added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

an increase from its previous forecast of 3.1% - before slowing slightly to 3.2% in 2027. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC, IMF chief economist Pierre Olivier Gourinchas said: \"We have a picture of a global economy that is growing at - it's not outsized growth rates but it's quite resilient, quite robust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a sense the global economy has been shaking off the trade disruptions of 2025, and it's coming out ahead of what we were expecting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said while the effects of Trumps' tariffs has been \"definitely to slow down global activity\", he added that there \"have been other things that have been more than offsetting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF's report says the global economy has been helped by \"tailwinds from surging investment related to technology, including artificial intelligence (AI)\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it said risks to the global outlook \"remain tilted to the downside\", warning that if expectations about AI growth turn out to be overly optimistic an abrupt market correction could be triggered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a relatively mild market correction could have an impact, Gourinchas said, given how much share price gains have contributed to wealth gains in recent years. Other risks are emerging as firms increasingly take on debt to make AI investments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't take as much of a market reaction to have an impact on people's wealth relative to their income so that they start cutting consumption, [businesses start] changing their investment plans etc, so there could be some vulnerability there,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as an end to the AI boom, another possible risk highlighted by the IMF was that \"trade tensions could flare up, prolonging uncertainty and weighing more heavily on activity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Domestic political tensions or geopolitical tensions could erupt, introducing new layers of uncertainty and disrupting the global economy through their impact on financial markets, supply chains, and commodity prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF estimates the UK grew by 1.4% in 2025, slightly up from its previous projection of 1.3%. Its forecast for this year remains unchanged at 1.3%, which would make it the third fastest growing economy in the G7 behind the US and Canada. It predicts 1.5% growth in 2027.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the IMF had upgraded the UK's growth for the third time since April 2025, and the country was \"on course to be the fastest growing European G7 economy this year and next\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"A 0.1% uptick is not a triumph and the fact Rachel Reeves is celebrating it shows how desperate she has become.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF expects global inflation to fall from an estimated 4.1% in 2025 to 3.8% in 2026 and further to 3.4% the following year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, Gourinchas said price changes in regulated industries, such as transport and energy, had kept inflation elevated last year but \"that's going to fade away\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF expects UK inflation to return to the 2% target by the end of the year, as a weakening labour market continues to keep wage growth down.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aac7/live/09006020-f525-11f0-ba75-29a1bdf58498.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A close up picture of US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell revealed last week he was the subject of a  criminal investigation</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF warned that central bank independence was \"paramount for macroeconomic stability and economic growth\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Preserving the independence of central banks, both legal and operational, remains critical for avoiding the risk of fiscal dominance, anchoring inflation expectations, and enabling them to achieve their mandates,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It comes a week after US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said he was the subject of an \"unprecedented\" US justice department criminal investigation over his testimony about the bank's building renovations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he believed this was due to Donald Trump's anger over the Fed not cutting interest rates, but Trump said he did not know about the investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Powell's comments prompted central bank heads across the world to declare \"full solidarity\" with the US Fed chief, while three former heads of the bank strongly criticised the investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gourinchas said preserving central bank independence would be key to economic success in the years ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without it, he warned, \"the economic environment deteriorates pretty rapidly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gourinchas said challenges to central bank independence had emerged elsewhere, particularly in countries with big borrowing needs, as leaders are enticed by the idea that lower interest rates would make it less expensive to fund government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he warned those dynamics tend to lead to inflation and higher borrowing costs over time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The evidence is very clear.

When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57303592\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">up to three children</a> per couple in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpk7r8w9yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new 13% tax on contraceptives</a> - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57154574\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">other factors</a> - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump insists Greenland is critical for US security and has previously said Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\". He has not ruled out use of force, which has drawn widespread criticism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new tariffs - taxes on imports - would be imposed on Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK, Trump said on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said an initial 10% tariff would come into force on 1 February \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US, but could rise to 25% in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The levies would \"be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\", he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their joint statement, the leaders of those eight countries reiterated their \"full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also stressed their commitment to \"strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest\" as members of the Nato military alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement reads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: \"We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict.

Its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press programme that \"Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said mutual respect for sovereignty is a \"non-negotiable\" principle of international law and co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we are to live in peace and if we are to be able to co-operate on shared problems, we have to start by the mutual recognition of each others sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he added.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"We will not give up\" on constructive dialogue with the US, says Danish Foreign Minister</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its \"anti-coercion instrument\" if Trump does impose them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme \"how can we co-operate in a more contested world?\" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was \"concerned by the recent escalation\" and that it would be \"significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato,\" he also wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Nato chief Rutte has said he has spoken to Trump \"regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,\" he added. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA/Shutterstock People take part in a protest under the slogans 'Hands off Greenland' and 'Greenland for Greenlanders' in Copenhagen, Denmark, 17 January 2026.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA/Shutterstock</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Protests were held over the weekend in both Denmark and Greenland</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished.

If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were thinking of China, not the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the here and now, some EU leaders are wary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The first ship is due to be delivered in 2028.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A further four will be constructed in Louisiana, with all six diesel-electric powered vessels using a design by Aker Arctic Technology, together with Canadian partner Seaspan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US orders are part of an effort to catch up with the number of Russian icebreakers.

He is crying, begging for his father's help.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's so hard to hear. Hearing his voice hurts me,\" Musa told BBC Africa Eye, which was given exclusive access to a police unit that helped him as he searched for two of his children who had fallen victim to scammers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was in February 2024 that Musa's 22-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter, along with five others, were recruited from their remote village in the Faranah region of central Guinea by agents promising them work abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The jobs never materialised and the so-called recruiters turned out to be human traffickers. The group was taken across the border into Sierra Leone and held captive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My heart is broken. I can't stop crying. If you look at my eyes, you can see the pain,\" Musa said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His case was picked up by the global policing agency Interpol in Guinea, which asked their unit in Sierra Leone to help. So last August Musa, travelled to Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, in a bid to find them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of people across West Africa are being lured by a human trafficking scam, commonly known as QNET.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Founded in Hong Kong, QNET itself is a legitimate wellness and lifestyle company - it allows people to sign up to buy their products and sell them online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64151759\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Its business model has faced some criticism</a> - however in West Africa, criminal gangs are using its name as a front for their illegal activities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The traffickers target people with the promise of work opportunities in places like the US, Canada, Dubai and Europe, asking them to pay large sums of money for administration costs before they start the job.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once they have paid, they are often trafficked to a neighbouring country and told they can only travel abroad once they recruit others into the scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even when they bring in family and friends, the jobs never materialise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://africa.qnet.net/opportunity/compliance-articles/qnet-against-scams-senegal/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">QNET itself has a campaign running across the region</a>, involving billboards and media adverts.

Travelling to Sierra Leone himself was his last hope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmoud Conteh, the head of investigations at the anti-trafficking unit of Interpol within the Sierra Leone police, said the case was a priority for his unit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's very easy for these traffickers to manoeuvre across each of our borders at these illegal crossing points,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Conteh received a tip-off that a large number of young people were being held in a location in Makeni, Musa joined the police as they raided the property, hoping to find his children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bags and clothes were strewn across the floors. It is thought 10 to 15 people slept in each room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Interpol team gathered everyone inside the property and found some as young as 14 had been living there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The majority are Guineans. There is only one Sierra Leonean among them. All the rest are Guineans,\" said Conteh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musa's children were not among them, though one young man said they had been there the previous week - the first potential sighting of his children in a year.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most of those found in the house in Makeni were from Guinea</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group were transferred to the police station for screening before 19 of them were taken home to Guinea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police say they have conducted more than 20 raids like this over the past year, rescuing hundreds of victims of human trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Often victims have been moved by the traffickers across borders, but others, like 23-year-old Aminata, a Sierra Leonean whose name has been changed to protect her identity, are trafficked within their own countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on a plastic chair with the slopes of Makeni's Wusum Hills behind her in the distance, Aminata told the BBC how a friend had introduced her to people claiming to represent QNET in mid-2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was successful in an interview and was told she would go on a course before flying to the US for further study and work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only catch was she had to pay $1,000 to join the scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Convinced it was legitimate, her family gave her the money they had saved for her college fees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When they first recruit you, they feed you, they take care of you.
