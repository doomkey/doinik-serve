This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Bolsonaro insisted he had no intention of fleeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also on Saturday, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in his coup attempt.

But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this is good news for the Russian president.

They were told his Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second-largest at the time, would be nationalised unless all ties to its founder were cut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't discuss the price,\" Tinkov told the New York Times. \"It was like a hostage - you take what you are offered.

It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chris Graythen/Getty Images A man wearing a white baseball cap and grey T-shirt grins while standing under a tree\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Oleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK.

Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the years that followed showed that immense benefits were to be reaped from being part of Putin's war economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. It was good for even those among Russia's ultra-rich who were not making billions directly out of defence contracts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's not even counting those who aren't directly involved, but do need a relationship of sorts with the Kremlin. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While allowing loyalists to profit, Putin has consistently punished those who have refused to toe the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russians remember all too well what happened to oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP Russia's richest man and oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky is seen in his cage in &quot;Matroska tishina&quot; prison on a TV screen during a video-link in the courthouse in Moscow, 15 January 2003\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalised</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If any of them had considered defecting to the West with their billions, the sanctions made that impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was absolutely no plan, no idea, no clear path for any of them to jump ship.

All that effectively helped Putin to mobilise the billionaires, their assets and their money, and use it to support the Russian war economy,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exodus of foreign companies in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine created a vacuum quickly filled by Kremlin-friendly business people who were allowed to buy up highly lucrative assets on the cheap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This created a new \"army of influential and active loyalists\", argues Alexandra Prokopenko of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their future wellbeing depends on continued confrontation between Russia and the West,\" while their worst fear is the return of the previous owner, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024 alone, 11 new billionaires emerged in Russia in this way, according to Giacomo Tognini.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's leader has maintained a firm grip on the country's key movers and shakers, despite the war and Western sanctions - and in some respects because of them.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It began when video footage of a confrontation between a man in a frog suit and immigration enforcement agents in Portland, Oregon went viral, and has since spread to protests across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a lot going on with that little inflatable frog,\" says LM Bogad, a professor at University of California, Davis and a Guggenheim Fellow who specialises in performance art.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">From Pepe to Portland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's hard to talk about protests and frogs without talking about Pepe, a cartoon character embraced by far-right groups during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the meme first took off online, the image was used to signal certain emotions. Later, it was deployed to show support for Trump, including one notable meme retweeted by Trump himself, depicting Pepe with Trump's signature suit and hair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe was also depicted in right-wing online communities on 4chan, 8chan and Reddit in darker contexts, as Adolf Hitler or a member of the violent white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. Online conservatives traded \"rare Pepes\" and set up cryptocurrency in his name. His catchphrase, \"feels good, man\", was deployed as an inside joke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe didn't start out so controversial.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its creator, artist Matt Furie, has been vocal about his distaste for how the image has been used. Pepe was supposed to be simply a \"chill frog-dude\" in this artist's universe of characters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog first appeared in a series of comics in 2005 - apolitical and best known for pulling his pants all the way down to pee. In the 2020 documentary Feels Good Man, which chronicles Mr Furie's efforts to wrest back control of his work, he said his Pepe drawing was inspired by his experiences with friends and roommates in his 20s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early in his career, Mr Furie experimented with uploading his work to the nascent social web, where other users began to borrow, remix and reinvent his character. As Pepe spread into the more extreme corners of the internet, Mr Furie tried to disavow the frog, even killing him off in a comic strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe lived on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It shows you that we don't control symbols,\" says Prof Bogad. \"They can change and shift and be reworked.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, the popularity of Pepe meant that frogs were largely associated with the right. But that changed on 2 October, when the confrontation between a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume with a blue neck scarf and an immigration officer went viral.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Protesters in frog suit and chicken suits stand outside the ICE centre\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The moment came just days after Trump ordered the National Guard to Portland, calling the city \"war-ravaged\". Protesters began to gather in droves on a single block just outside an immigration enforcement facility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions were high and an immigration officer sprayed a chemical agent at a protester, aiming directly into the air intake fan of the puffy frog costume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protester, Seth Todd, responded with a joke, saying he had tasted \"spicier tamales\". But the incident went viral nonetheless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Todd's attire was not too unusual for Portland, known for its quirky culture and left-wing protests that revel in the absurd - public yoga and 80s-style aerobics lessons, and nude cycling groups. The city's unofficial motto is \"Keep Portland Weird\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog even played a role in the ensuing legal battle between the Trump administration and the city, which argued the National Guard deployment was unlawful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the court ruled in October that Trump had the right to deploy troops, one judge dissented, referencing in her minority ruling the protesters' \"well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods deployed by ICE\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterisation of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Judge Susan Graber wrote. \"But today's decision is not merely absurd.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's deployment was \"permanently\" blocked by courts just a month later, and troops have reportedly departed the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by then, the frog had become a potent anti-administration symbol for the left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The costume was spotted across the country at No Kings protests last autumn. There were frogs - and unicorns and axolotls and dinosaurs - in San Diego and Atlanta and Boston. They were in small towns like Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and big international cities like Tokyo and London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog costume was back-ordered on Amazon and rose in price.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Controlling the optics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What brings both frogs together - Pepe and the Portland frog - is the interplay between the humorous, benign cartoon amphibian and a deeper political meaning. This is what political scientists call \"tactical frivolity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy rests on what Prof Bogad calls the \"irresistible image\" - often silly, it's a \"disarming and charming\" display that calls attention to your ideas without obviously explaining them to a viewer. It's the goofy costume you wear, or the symbol you draw, or the meme you share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bogad is both an expert in the subject and a veteran practitioner himself. He's written a book on the subject, Tactical Performance: The Theory and Practice of Serious Play, and taught workshops around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could go back to the Middle Ages - when people are dominated, they use absurdity to speak the truth a little bit and still have plausible deniability.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea of this approach is three-fold, Prof Bogad says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As protesters take on a powerful opposition, a silly costume takes control of the optics. \"It makes it look worse if you respond with violence,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Second, an image can set a certain tone for those within the movement and would-be supporters. In Portland \"it was like a radical costume ball and we all got invited\", Prof Bogad says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, this kind of tactic can offer political cover for criticism. Sometimes that shows up in claims of political memes as \"just a joke\" - a defence against critics who would brand your views as dangerous. But it's especially useful in circumstances where government criticism can be dangerous, Prof Bogad says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests</figcaption></p></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A protester in a frog costume holds a subway sandwich and wears a sticker that says No Kings\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The costumes have been frequently seen at protests in Washington DC</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He points to Otpor, the Serbian pro-democracy protest movement that supported efforts to overthrow Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 through pranks and street comedy. For years, critics of Chinese President Xi Jinping have shared images of Winnie the Pooh to signal their opposition online, where more bold-faced criticism could face censorship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have also embraced Pepe, unaware of its political affiliations in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, authoritarians don't like to be laughed at,\" Prof Bogad says. This kind of symbolism works because \"without even giving a speech, you are undermining the authoritarian script\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home in Oregon, a group of Portlanders doubled down on the viral fame and banded together to form \"Operation Inflation\", which collects and distributes inflatable costumes to protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They started a website where supporters can donate $35 to buy suits \"for community members to wear at ICE protest sites to help deflate (pun intended) the tensions surrounding protests\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brooks Brown, a co-founder of Operation Inflation, says the point is to \"shift the story that's being told\" by the Trump administration that all protesters are part of a violent mob.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our job is to build a different stage, and to force them onto ours,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Brown says the inflatables bear similarities with the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, when protesters would often dress in their Sunday finest and sit motionless as they were harassed by counter-protesters and arrested by aggressive police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe, Mr Brown says, \"was a fascist symbol for 4chan.

But also, so they can put something to one side to buy a little land on which we can eventually build a house, maybe buy a car,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump took office, Marcos says he only keeps the very minimum he needs for rent and food in the US.

Using what he had learned at Berklee and combining it with Ethiopian modes, he \"created this science called Ethio-jazz\", Mulatu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially his radical sound was met with complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember them telling me 'get off, stop, stop there'.

Was it the cello or the masenqo?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is we don't do research. We have so many great scientists in Africa. Great people, geniuses, who created all these instruments. But we don't give them credit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, he says his mission is to broaden the range of the traditional instruments of his homeland by \"computerising\" the sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his fans, it is his unique blend of the modern and traditional that makes Ethio-jazz so special.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reminds me a lot of music from South Asia, melded with the pentatonic scale which reminds me more of Arab music, along with the African percussion sounds that come through,\" said concert-goer Joseph Badawi-Crook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a completely unique mix and I just fell in love with it years ago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mulatu's legacy spans generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our grandparents or our parents or our aunts or our uncles, have seen Mulatu throughout his career,\" said London-based Ethiopian fan Solliana Kineferigb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To also be part of the younger generation and to have the opportunity to still see him live is amazing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the touring may be over, Mulatu pledges to continue to bring Ethiopian music to the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not the end,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about African music:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A composite image of two pictures of Gen Mamadi Doumbouya.

Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His overthrow of Condé - who had staged a dubious constitutional referendum to allow himself the chance to stand for a third term and had overseen frequent bouts of security force brutality - was celebrated on the streets of Conakry and barely criticised abroad.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97a1/live/3b1b6060-e02f-11f0-997b-df531e67f496.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A poster of Mamadi Doumbouya is displayed outside in front of a kiosk where people are watching TV.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gen Mamadi Doumbouya has dominated the build-up to the election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn4v0599d1no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Doumbouya earned international goodwill when he pressed quickly ahead with the long-delayed trial of those accused of a notorious 2009 stadium massacre</a> when about 150 opposition supporters were killed and many women raped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And even though his own rule saw youth protesters shot, and leading civil society activists Billo Bah and Foniké Mengué detained and never heard from since, regional and international reactions were muted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">West Africa has been shaken by coups and the breakaway of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger from Ecowas, as well as this month's attempted putsch in Benin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guinea's decision to stay in the bloc and restore elected government -

The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war. Even where voting is taking place, it is marred by a climate of fear and intimidation.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC tried asking people at the rally in Mandalay what they thought of the  election, we were told not to by party officials. They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay. At a market stall selling fresh river fish the customers all refused to answer what they thought of the election. We have no choice, so we have to vote, one said. The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid. Everyone has lost their humanity and their freedom. So many people have died, been tortured or fled to other countries. If the military keeps running the country, how can things change?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would not vote, she said, but she knew that decision carried risks.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8efb/live/468068d0-e235-11f0-9988-abf27981bd79.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lulu Luo/ BBC People walking down the street in Mandalay, past parked two-wheelers.

It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'No-one is ready to compromise'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints.

The abduction was captured on CCTV and gripped the nation for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high court ruled that the elite Special Branch of the police had taken Raymond Koh, and held both the police and the Malaysian government responsible for the country's first-ever enforced disappearance case to be heard in a court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years Ms Liew fought to find out what happened to her husband, transforming from an ordinary pastor's wife to a fierce campaigner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She may never know for sure why her husband was taken, but two independent official investigations found that the police saw the pastor as a threat to Islam, Malaysia's majority religion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC shortly after her court victory, Ms Liew said she was driven to pursue justice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A voice [inside me] said… 'So they took him in secret - I will let the whole world know'.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: CCTV captures moment pastor Raymond Koh is abducted</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 13 February 2017, shortly after 10am, Mr Koh left his family home to meet friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the 63-year-old drove out of his house in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb, a convoy of SUVs and motorcycles roared up to his vehicle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Masked men in black clothing sprang out. Glass shards flew everywhere as they smashed a window of Mr Koh's car and dragged out the pastor. They bundled him into one of their vehicles and drove off, taking his car with them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction took place in seconds. It was so dramatic that one eyewitness driving behind Mr Koh later testified that he thought it was a movie shoot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the following days Mr Koh's children went door to door looking for clues to their father's disappearance - and discovered that two homes' CCTV cameras had captured the entire incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Watching the footage, the family realised it was no ordinary abduction. It was meticulous and well-co-ordinated. They had also not received any ransom note or been contacted by kidnappers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few months before, in November 2016, an activist named Amri Che Mat from the northern state of Perlis had been abducted in almost exactly the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Koh's family went to the media, and the CCTV footage instantly went viral when it was published online by a local newspaper. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The public demanded answers, and Malaysia's human rights commission - an independent body set up by parliament - launched an investigation. Later, there was also a separate investigation by the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many speculated that the Special Branch was responsible. But the police denied involvement, its chief telling the public to \"please shut up\" so they could investigate the disappearance in peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Months later, after conducting their investigations, the police claimed a drug trafficking ring had taken Mr Koh. Separately, they arrested an Uber driver for kidnapping him - a charge that was eventually dropped. Both these leads were later ruled as not credible by the rights commission in the final report of their investigation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b00a/live/0dd657d0-bee3-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Family of Raymond Koh Pastor Raymond Koh smiles at the camera while wearing a dark blue suit and a pink tie, and black-rimmed glasses\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Family of Raymond Koh</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pastor Raymond Koh was taken in 2017 in Kuala Lumpur </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Mr Koh's disappearance took a toll on his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew sold handcrafted jewellery to make ends meet, while relying on her savings and donations to put her youngest daughter through university.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she had expected sympathy from the police. Instead, on the night she reported her husband's disappearance, she said she was questioned for five hours about whether Mr Koh had tried to convert Muslims to Christianity. \"I was very traumatised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her interrogator later testified during the rights commission's investigation hearing that he had been instructed by his supervisors to pursue this line of inquiry because Mr Koh was a pastor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011 Mr Koh had been accused of apostasy - a crime in Muslim-majority Malaysia - when he organised a party at a church which some Muslims also attended. He was investigated by Islamic authorities but no action was taken. He and his family have always denied that he was trying to convert Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years after Mr Koh's disappearance, Ms Liew said, she felt that \"the police were not forthcoming with their investigation and even, at times, they were hindering us from finding out the truth and produced red herrings\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family has long maintained the police's theories were attempts to cover up their role in his abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the Malaysian police for a response to these allegations. They have yet to reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the search for answers dragged on, everyone in the family began experiencing depression, Ms Liew said. She still suffers from panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, there was a breakthrough.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The car and the confession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late one night in May 2018, a man showed up at the house of Norhayati, the wife of Amri Che Mat, the<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>activist who had been abducted in 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Identifying himself as a police sergeant, he<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>delivered shocking information: the Special Branch had indeed kidnapped her husband and Raymond Koh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police believed Mr Koh was trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, he said, and that Amri Che Mat was spreading Shia Islam, which is banned in Sunni-dominant Malaysia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police sergeant said he wanted to tell Ms Norhayati what happened, as he felt what the Special Branch did was wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati's account of this confession was investigated by the human rights commission and eventually ruled as credible. While the sergeant later denied he made the confession, the commission found his denial to be full of inconsistencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, there was the gold-coloured car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness to Mr Koh's abduction recalled seeing a gold-coloured Toyota Vios - a similar car was spotted near Amri Che Mat's house prior to his disappearance. The police sergeant also mentioned a gold-coloured car's presence in both abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators for the rights commission traced that car to a man in Kuala Lumpur who worked for the Special Branch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In April 2019, the commission concluded the Special Branch was responsible for the abductions of Raymond Koh and Amri Che Mat. It said the two men were \"targeted by religious authorities and the police over allegations that they were involved in matters against Islam in Malaysia\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report stunned the Malaysian public, with some demanding accountability. Months later, the government launched its own investigation, which was made public only after Ms Liew and Ms Norhayati sued for access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's investigation came to a similar conclusion, blaming \"irresponsible rogue cops\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its report also named a \"main person of interest\" - a senior Special Branch official, Awaludin bin Jadid, who headed the unit tackling social extremism.

The trust's money, which will be paid out only once Mr Koh's whereabouts are disclosed, will likely go to Ms Liew and her children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati, who also launched a lawsuit, won her case and received several million ringgit in compensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the government is appealing against these verdicts, arguing there are \"issues related to financial obligations\" and that it needs to \"uphold the principle of universal justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also said the police are continuing to investigate the abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the police for comment on the verdict. They have yet to reply.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Frozen in grief'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew hopes the government will drop the appeal. \"I would feel very tired if I have to do this all over again,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family is already worn down from \"the uncertainty of not knowing where Pastor Raymond is… it's like we are frozen in grief and we can't move on\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we know that he's dead and have his body, at least we can bury him and we can move on. But right now, we are in a limbo. We don't know - is he dead or alive? - and this takes a toll on us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew choked up at the thought that her husband may be dead. \"It's going to be very hard to accept that,\" she said, adding she \"wants to hope\" that her husband is alive.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"We are frozen in grief,\" says Koh's wife, Susanna Liew</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But time is helping the family to heal. Inspired by counsellors who helped her through her depression, Ms Liew has been training to become one herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Telling her story has also been a \"catharsis\", she said. Over the years, as she travelled the world to raise awareness of her husband's case, she became an outspoken critic of enforced disappearances. In 2020 the US awarded her an International Women of Courage medal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I never expected that I would be at this place. Eight years ago, I was just a housewife and a quiet person,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew has also reached a turning point on a more personal level – she has forgiven the men whom she believes took her husband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the trial, as she watched the lawsuit's defendants take the stand, at first \"I felt like squeezing their necks. I was angry with them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But I noticed that when I came face to face with the main suspect - I felt no hatred… I want to be really right and pure before God, and not have any shadow or darkness in my life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Forgiveness, however, does not mean she will stop her<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>pursuit of justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is now calling for the authorities to set up a disciplinary body to monitor police conduct, as well as a commission of inquiry and a task force to track down every single person involved in her husband's abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, none of the police officials named in her lawsuit have been arrested or punished. One of them has been promoted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we really want is for the truth and justice to prevail, for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, and for us to have good closure,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That means, we want to know where Pastor Raymond is.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
