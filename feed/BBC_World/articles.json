Mobile internet outages have been blamed by authorities on Ukrainian drone attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin also addressed Russia's faltering economy, with prices rising, growth on the slide and VAT going up from 20 to 22% on 1 January. One message to the president read: \"Stop the crazy rise in prices on everything!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin regularly uses the end-of-year event to highlight the resilience of the economy and, as Putin spoke, Russia's central bank announced it was lowering interest rates to 16%.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign policy issues were mixed with musings about the motherland, praise for local businesses, fish prices and the importance of looking after veterans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of almost four years of full-scale war in Ukraine was never far away and it was often in the background of many of the questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin again claimed to be \"ready and willing\" to end the war in Ukraine \"peacefully\" but offered little sign of compromise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He repeated his insistence on principles he had outlined in a June 2024 speech, when he demanded that Ukrainian forces leave four regions Russia partially occupies and that Kyiv gives up its efforts to join Nato.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief among Russia's demands is full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas, including about 23% of Donetsk region which Russia has not been able to occupy.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin argued Russian forces were making advances across the front line in Ukraine and he ridiculed Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the front line at Kupiansk last week, when the Ukrainian leader was able to refute Russia claims that it had captured the town.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has also demanded new elections in Ukraine to be included in the peace proposals that US President Donald Trump has submitted as part of his efforts to bring the conflict to an end. At his news conference, Putin offered to stop bombing Ukraine when voting took place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's SBU security service said on Friday it had for the first time hit an oil tanker operating as part of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.  Putin said it would not lead to the result that Kyiv wanted and would not disrupt Russian exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the questions from Russian media or from the public made little attempt to challenge Putin, but two were allowed from Western correspondents, Keir Simmons of US network NBC and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Simmons asked if Putin would feel responsible for the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians if he rejected the Trump peace plan, Putin praised the US president's \"sincere\" efforts to end the war, but said it was the West not Russia that was blocking a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ball is in the hands of our Western opponents,\" he said, \"primarily the leaders of the Kyiv regime, and in this case, first and foremost, their European sponsors.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said a peace deal is closer than ever and, despite Putin's apparent refusal to compromise, the US president has said he hopes \"Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Ukrainian delegation is holding talks in Miami on Friday with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. German, French and British officials are also there, days after they met the US officials in Berlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also expected in Miami over the weekend, according to reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin told the BBC's Russia Editor: \"We are ready to work with you - with the UK and with Europe in general and with the United States, but as equals, with mutual respect to each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to cease these hostilities immediately, provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to cooperate with you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the West of creating an enemy out of Russia. Skating over his decision to mount a full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said: \"You are waging a war against us with the hands of Ukrainian neo-Nazis,\" before repeating his regular diatribe against Ukraine's democratically elected leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is only a few years away from attacking Nato. The Western defensive alliance's chief Mark Rutte said this month that Russia was already escalating a covert campaign and the West had to be prepared for war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many of the questions were benign, including several from children, from a one reporter from Yakutia in north-eastern Siberia highlighted a tenfold increase in energy prices in the past four years. Putin told her that his team would look into alternative sources of energy and \"keep Yakutia in mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Towards the end of the TV marathon, Putin was asked a series of quickfire questions, touching on his views on friendship, religion, the motherland and love at first sight. He said he believed in love at first sight - then added that he himself was in love, without divulging any more details.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Russia has already launched legal action against the clearing house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian President Vladimir Putin accused EU leaders of attempted robbery on Friday and Kirill Dmitriev, his envoy in talks with the US, claimed their failure to agree on using the assets was a \"fatal blow\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Belgium's Bart De Wever said the deal eventually agreed after almost 17 hours of negotiations was a \"victory for Ukraine, a victory for financial stability... and a victory for the EU\".

Although the idea has not been dropped, the decision to borrow the money against the EU budget instead is seen as a setback for him. Nevertheless, he declared that it \"sends a clear signal from Europe to Putin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two countries, Hungary and Slovakia, refused to back the compromise deal, while the Czech Republic said it would not guarantee the loan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Vladimir Putin's closest partner in the EU, has opposed handing any more

Naveed Akram, 24, has been charged with 59 offences, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day after the shooting, national cabinet - which includes representatives from the federal government and leaders from all states and territories - agreed to tighten gun controls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to media on Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said there are now more than 4 million firearms in Australia - more than at the time of the Port Arthur massacre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know that one of these terrorists held a firearm licence and had six guns, in spite of living in the middle of Sydney's suburbs... There's no reason why someone in that situation needed that many guns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you're going to reduce the number of guns, then a buyback scheme has to be a piece of that puzzle,\" Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new scheme will purchase surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms, and will be funded on a 50-50 basis with the states and territories. Hundreds of thousands of firearms will be collected and destroyed, the government estimates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">National cabinet has also agreed to impose limits on the number of firearms held by any one individual, restrict open-ended firearms licensing and the types of guns that are legal and make Australian citizenship a condition of holding a firearm licence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Work on a national firearms register will be accelerated and firearm regulators will have better access to criminal intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, New South Wales Police said they were preparing to release seven men with extremist ideology, but that they would continue to be monitored.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tactical officers swarmed on the group, who had travelled from Victoria and were known to police there, in dramatic scenes in the suburb of Liverpool on Thursday. Officers found a knife, but no guns or other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">NSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a press conference there is \"no confirmed link\" between the alleged terrorists and the detained group, but that Bondi Beach was one of several locations the latter was intending to visit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whilst this specific threat posed by the males is unknown, I can say that the potential [for] a violent offence being committed was such that we were not prepared to tolerate the risk,\" Commissioner Lanyon said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A committee has been set up to investigate the cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The families are from Satna district. Although the infections were detected during routine screening between January and May 2025, they drew wider attention after local media reports earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cases follow a similar incident in the eastern state of Jharkhand weeks earlier, where five children with thalassemia, all under eight, were found to have contracted HIV after blood transfusions at a state-run hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, spreads through unprotected sex, unsafe medical practices, infected blood transfusions, or from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While no longer a death sentence, it requires lifelong management.

In the other cases, the parents tested negative, ruling out mother-to-child transmission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satna's chief medical and health officer Manoj Shukla said children with multiple transfusions are considered high-risk and are routinely screened for HIV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once detected, treatment was started immediately and is continuing.

Within a few days, the internet had moved on, but for Ms Cabot, her ordeal had only just begun. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I became a meme, I was the most maligned HR manager in HR history,\" Ms Cabot <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/us/news-today/article/coldplay-kisscam-boss-kristin-cabot-andy-byron-9qst70b7z?gaa_at=eafs\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told The Times</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cabot was separated from her husband, who was also at the concert.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a separate interview with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/18/style/coldplay-concert-couple-kiss-cam-woman.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the New York Times</a>, she explained she was not in a sexual relationship with Mr Byron and the pair had never kissed before that night - although she admitted to having had a \"crush\" on her boss.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I made a bad decision and had a couple of High Noons and danced and acted inappropriately with my boss,\" she said, adding she \"took accountability and I gave up my career for that\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As to why she chose to speak out now, Ms Cabot told the Times \"...it's not over for me, and it's not over for my kids. The harassment never ended\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her two children are too embarrassed to be picked up from school by their mother, she said, or to go to sports games.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're mad at me. And they can be mad at me for the rest of their lives - I have to take that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cabot wondered whether Mr Byron had received the same level of abuse in the wake of the scandal, the Times reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think as a woman, as women always do, I took the bulk of the abuse. People would say things like I was a 'gold-digger' or I 'slept my way to the top', which just couldn't be further from reality,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I worked so hard to dispel that all my life and here I was being accused of it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the peak of the scandal, her appearance, body, face and clothes were scrutinised and picked apart, with many high-profile celebrities including Whoopi Goldberg piling on. Gwyneth Paltrow, who was once married to Chris Martin, even took part in a tongue-in-cheek promotional video for Astronomer.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cabot told the New York Times she received threatening messages after the incident, including from a person who said they knew where she shopped and wrote: \"I'm coming for you\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said \"my kids were afraid that I was going to die and they were going to die\", and that her family began to dread public spaces and social events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women were the cruellest critics, she told the New York Times, with all of the in-person bullying, plus most of the phone calls and messages coming from women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her private details were put online (known as doxxing) and for weeks she was bombarded with up to 600 calls a day, the New York Times reported. The paparazzi outside her house was like a \"parade\" and there were 50 or 60 death threats, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Things are starting to improve, though. Ms Cabot has found therapists for her children and she has started leaving the house to play tennis.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While she and Mr Byron kept in touch for a short while, exchanging \"crisis management advice\", Ms Cabot said they decided that \"speaking with each other was going to make it too hard for everyone to move on and heal,\" and have not spoken since.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his part, Mr Byron has not spoken publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A fake statement purporting to be from him, complete with Coldplay lyrics, went viral after the concert and Astronomer had to release its own to say that he had not made any comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding,\" the statement read. \"Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company later said: \"Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has tried to contact Andy Byron, via his former employer Astronomer, for comment.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Hicks said he accepted his appointment, which was announced on Thursday, with \"an open heart\" and Dolan called it \"an early Christmas gift\" for New Yorkers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Hicks joined other bishops to condemn the Trump administration's large scale immigration-related arrests as part of its mass deportation agenda.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hicks' early life and pastoral career closely mirror Pope Leo's. He grew up in South Holland, a short distance from Leo's Dolton neighbourhood in the suburb of Chicago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Pope Leo spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, Hicks worked at an orphanage in El Salvador from 2005 to 2010, according to a biography released by the New York archdiocese. Hicks was appointed bishop of Joliet by Pope Francis in 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like the pope, Hicks has been outspoken about his concerns for immigrants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Deeply rooted in our Gospel tradition of loving our neighbor, this letter affirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction,\" he said, in response to a joint-letter written by US bishops expressing concerns about the situation immigrants in the United States face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is grounded in the Church's enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform,\" he said</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has carried out large scale immigration arrests in the Chicago area, leading to clashes between federal agents and residents protesting their presence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops' letter comes as churches grapple with how to respond to immigration activity that affects their members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of people at risk of deportation are Christians, with 61% of the at-risk group being Catholics, according to a report by the US Catholic Bishops Conference.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hicks will now leave his position as bishop of Joliet for the ornate sanctuary at St Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, where he will lead 2.5 million Catholics in the nation's largest city.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>He will officially be installed at the cathedral on 6 February 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His appointment comes a week after Cardinal Dolan, who has served in New York City for about 16 years, announced the archdiocese will set up a $300 million fund to settle claims of clergy sex abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a church, we can never rest in our efforts to prevent abuse, to protect children and to care for survivors,\" the incoming archbishop said at a news conference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While this work is challenging, it's difficult, it's painful, I hope it will continue to help in the areas of accountability, transparency and healing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cardinal Dolan, of Missouri, announced his resignation in February, as required by church law when bishops turn 75. He was named head of the church in New York by Pope Benedict XVI in 2009, who later made him cardinal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He participated in two conclaves, one that elected Pope Francis in 2013 and the second that elected Leo XIV last May. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cardinal led prayers at both of Trump's inaugurations, and was appointed by the president to the new Religious Liberty Commission earlier this year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But classifying it as a Schedule III narcotic would allow expanded research to be conducted into its potential benefits. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Republican lawmakers cautioned against the move, with some arguing it could normalise cannabis use. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Drug Enforcement Agency notes that Schedule III narcotics - which also include ketamine and anabolic steroids - have only a \"moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking in the Oval Office during a signing ceremony on Thursday, Trump said that people have been \"begging\" for the change, particularly those in \"great pain\" from ailments including \"incurable pain\", cancer, seizure disorders and veterans with service-related injuries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president compared cannabis to prescription painkillers that have legitimate uses \"but can also do irreversible damages\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new classification also has tax implications for state-authorised cannabis dispensaries, as current regulations bar them from some tax deductions if they sell Schedule I products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition to the rescheduling of cannabis, Trump has ordered White House officials to work with Congress to allow some Americans access to cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also asked White House officials to work with Congress to allow some Americans access to cannabidiol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health officials have also been tasked with developing \"methods and models\" to examine the real-world health benefits and risks of CBD.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior administration official said that the order was a \"commonsense action that will let us better understand and study\" cannabis and CBD. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, a majority of US states have approved cannabis for some medical use, and nearly half - 24 - have legalised recreational use. But since 1971, cannabis has been  a Schedule I narcotic, which means it has no accepted medical use and a high potential to be abused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Biden administration proposed a similar reclassification, and in April 2024 the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68932612\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">DEA proposed a rule change</a>, but got bogged down under administrative and legal issues. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's order drew praise from organisations that have been working to change US cannabis regulations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tim Barash, chairman of the Coalition of Cannabis Scheduling Reform, said in a statement that the move represents a \"fundamental shift\" in government and social perceptions of the drug. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This change will empower the 425,000 people working in the US cannabis industry and bring in new talent, capital, and awareness to an industry that has a positive impact on millions of people's lives,\" Mr Barash said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the reclassification order has met some resistance from Republican lawmakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, a group of 22 Republican Senators sent an open letter to the president, arguing that marijuana use would mean that \"we cannot re-industrialise America\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senators pointed to lingering concerns over the health impact of cannabis, as well as research suggesting that cannabis can be linked to \"impaired judgement\" and \"lack of concentration\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a separate letter sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi in August, nine Republican representatives argued that \"no adequate science or data\" exists to support the change. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter said. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, polls show that a majority of Americans support efforts to legalise marijuana. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One Gallup poll released in November found that 64% of Americans believe that it should be legalised, although support had drifted slightly from previous years because of a 13-point drop among Republicans. </p></div></div></body></html>"

The oldest victim was 89.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was conveniently ignored until it was too late. The gaslighting and dismissal must end,\" he was quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald as saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a \"violent act was possibly being planned\", New South Wales Police said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police said they did not identify \"any connection\" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two cars were \"intercepted\" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It could release vast amounts of energy with little associated radioactivity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement said the combined company planned to begin constructing the \"world's first utility-scale fusion power plant\" next year, with further plants to follow.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the merger both firms will have an equal 50% share in ownership after the deal is completed, which is expected by mid-2026 pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The combined company will have a nine-member board including Trump Media's current chief executive Devin Nunes, who will be co-chief executive of the new firm, and the president's son Donald Trump Jr.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">TAE Technologies provides technology for energy storage and power delivery systems for batteries and electric vehicles. Its umbrella organisation, TAE Life Sciences, develops technologies and drugs for treating cancer patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tie-up with the firm signals a bold and surprising shift for Trump Media, as it moves from social media and financial offerings into the energy sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nunes said his firm was \"taking a big step forward toward a revolutionary technology that will cement America's global energy dominance for generations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Calling fusion power the \"most dramatic energy breakthrough\" since the 1950s, he said Trump Media would bring \"the capital and public market access\" to help make TAE's technology commercial viable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the agreement, Trump Media is to provide up to $200m (£149m) of cash to TAE Technologies when completion of the deal is signed. An additional $100m (£74.7m) will be available once the transaction has been registered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Surging electricity demand for AI data centers has revived interest in cleaner and reliable nuclear power, including restarting shuttered reactors, expanding existing ones and signing contracts for future small modular reactors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The joint statement said TAE Technologies had raised more than $1.3bn of funding from other investors including Google and Goldman Sachs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump Media, which mainly generates revenue from advertising on the Truth Social platform, has consistently clocked losses since it began. It posted a decline in revenue and a loss of $54.8m (£40.9m) in the third quarter ending September.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Ukrainian military has since agreed to reopen the investigation, recognising failures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now she is fighting to re-open the case: \"I'm fighting for his name.

none more so than for leading gun control advocate Roland Browne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the country's deadliest modern-day mass shooting was unfolding an hour's drive away, Mr Browne was meeting fellow gun control advocates at his home, ahead of a government meeting, to lobby for a ban on the exact type of firearm the Port Arthur gunman was using.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Browne, 66, was again at home in Hobart on Sunday when he received news of the shooting at Bondi, targeting a Jewish event celebrating the first night of Hanukkah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's just a lot of similarities,\" Mr Browne, who spent childhood summers in Bondi and still has family there, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're both very public places frequented by tourists from around the nation and around the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's sickening and I'm bitterly disappointed in our political system whereby the voices for tighter gun laws and public health aren't listened to until there's a major event like this,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For decades, Australia has stood as a beacon on the world stage for its strict gun laws, he says, taking a similar path to the UK which experienced its own mass shooting in Dunblane, just one month before Port Arthur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even now, Mr Browne remains friends with relatives of some of the 17 victims -

Under new laws introduced in March this year, gun owners can have between five and ten firearms, depending on the type of licence and model of firearm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have confirmed that one of the alleged gunmen, Sajid Akram who was killed at the scene of the Bondi attack, owned six registered guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Browne wants a cap of one to three guns, depending on the licence category, to be introduced across Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Tom Kenyon, chief executive of the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia, argues that a cap would be meaningless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Limiting the number of guns wouldn't have made a difference on Sunday,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And it wouldn't have changed the fact that an attack occurred because those two individuals had been radicalised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kenyon argues that people intent on harm, without access to guns, will use other weapons, referencing the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-63954860\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2016 Bastille Day massacre in the French city of Nice</a> where 86 people were killed after a man drove a truck into crowds during fireworks celebrations. The attack was claimed by Islamic State (IS).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other alleged Bondi gunman, 24-year-old Naveed Akram, was previously investigated over links to IS, according to comments made by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kenyon also says that more guns are found in cities because most people in Australia live in metropolitan areas and travel to other areas to hunt. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tasmania has the most guns per person in Australia</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Australia's current gun laws?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gun control laws in Australia are not uniform across the country, with inconsistent implementation of the rules across states and territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But generally, to apply for a gun licence, you must be over 18, a \"fit and proper person\", pass a training and safety course and give a \"genuine reason\" for having a firearm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The eight accepted reasons include recreational hunting or pest control, target or sport shooting, for work (such as security guards and prison officers), for use in farming or animal welfare and firearms collectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are loopholes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, anyone under 18 was meant to be barred from owning a firearm under the 1996 gun control reforms, but minors in various jurisdictions can have access to a firearm while under supervision, ranging from age 10 in the Northern Territory to 12 in other states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another situation is where a particular type of gun is banned in one state but legal elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the days after the Port Arthur massacre, then-Australian prime ministerJohn Howard galvanised every state and territory to overhaul the country's gun laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 650,000 firearms were voluntarily handed in to authorities and destroyed, as part of a buyback programme. And background checks and a mandatory cooling-off period for gun sales were introduced. Automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar gun reforms - a ban on semi-automatic weapons and a buyback scheme - were introduced in New Zealand after a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47593693\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">white supremacist killed 51 Muslims at two Christchurch mosques in 2019</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Part of Howard's reforms included scrapping self-defence as a reason for owning a firearm - a contrast to gun laws in the United States where personal protection is often the main reason for citizens to own guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gun ownership in the US is much higher compared to Australia as is gun violence. The country saw 488 mass shootings - defined as where four or more people are killed or injured - last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent polling by the Australia Institute showed that seven out of ten Australians think gun laws should make it harder to access a gun and 64% agreed that current gun laws need to be strengthened.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6ee/live/065e3210-dc7b-11f0-aa7f-7925b6db1558.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man, in a blue jumpsuit and wearing a white hardhat, crouching on top of a large pile of rifles while holding one \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">An estimated 650,000 firearms were handed in and destroyed after the Port Arthur massacre</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Fresh reform for gun laws</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the hours after the Bondi shooting, the NSW Premier Chris Minns was unequivocal about the need to tighten the state's gun laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And less than 24 hours after the shooting, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hosted an emergency meeting where leaders from across the country pledged to tighten gun laws.

suspect ‍in ​last week's ‌mass shooting at Brown University has been found dead in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, following a six-day multi-state manhunt, police say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They identified the suspect as Claudio Neves Valente, 48, a Portuguese national who studied at the university in Providence, Rhode Island, about 25 years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Providence police chief Oscar Perez said video evidence and tips from the public led investigators to a car-rental location where they found the suspect's name and matched him to their person of interest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said they also believe Valente killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor two days after the 13 December shooting at Brown.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial findings suggest Valente died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and police were unable to comment on how long he might have been inside the storage facility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have not suggested a motive for either attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brown University president Christina Paxson said that Valente was enrolled at the Ivy League school from the autumn of 2000 to the following spring, and was studying for a PhD in physics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had \"no current active affiliation\" to Brown, she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said they believe Valente shot and killed MIT professor Nuno F Gomes Loureiro, 47, on Monday at his home in Brookline, which is about 50 miles (80km) from Providence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the victim and the suspect had studied at the same university in Portugal in the late 1990s, police said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cases were linked when the suspect's vehicle was identified via CCTV footage and a witness at Brown University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said Valente was found dead with a satchel and two firearms. Evidence in a car nearby matched to the scene in Providence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same car was spotted near the scene of the professor's shooting.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though the suspect was found dead tonight our work is not done.

She has since been living with her parents in West Bengal. Her husband, released on bail, remains in Bangladesh with a relative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Khatun, says she has mixed feelings about being allowed back in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is relieved that her baby, due in January, will be an Indian citizen by birthright, but is anxious about her husband, whom she has not seen for more than three months since they were held in separate prison cells in Bangladesh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On video calls, she says, he breaks down often, saying that he wants to come home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not from Bangladesh, we are Indian.

From 2003 to August 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-avian-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region-15-october-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reported</a> 990 human H5N1 cases across 25 countries, including 475 deaths - a 48% fatality rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US alone, the virus has struck more than 180 million birds, spread to over 1,000 dairy herds in 18 states, and infected at least 70 people - mostly farmworkers - causing several hospitalisations and one death. In January, three tigers and a leopard died at a wildlife rescue centre in India's Nagpur city from the virus that typically infects birds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Symptoms in humans mimic a severe flu: high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and, at times, conjunctivitis. Some people have no symptoms at all. The risk to humans remains low, but authorities are watching H5N1 closely for any shift that could make it spread more easily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That concern is what prompted new peer-reviewed modelling by Indian researchers Philip Cherian and Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which simulates how an H5N1 outbreak might unfold in humans and what early interventions could stop it before it spreads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words, the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> model </a>published in the BMC Public Health journal uses real world data and computer simulations to play out how an outbreak might spread in real life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The threat of an H5N1 pandemic in humans is a genuine one, but we can hope to forestall it through better surveillance and a more nimble public-health response,\" Prof Menon told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A bird flu pandemic, researchers say, would begin quietly: a single infected bird passing the virus to a human - most likely a farmer, market worker or someone handling poultry. From there, the danger lies not in that first infection but in what happens next: sustained human-to-human transmission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because real outbreaks start with limited, messy data, the researchers turned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BharatSim</a>, an open-source simulation platform originally built for Covid 19 modelling, but versatile enough to study other diseases.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images A worker at National Zoological Park sprays pesticides at the entrance gate to sanitize the premises as bird flu spread in the zoo area on 1 September, 2025 in New Delhi, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A bird flu outbreak in a Delhi zoo shut down the facility for a few days in August</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The key takeaway for policymakers is how narrow the window for action can be before an outbreak spirals out of control, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paper estimates that once cases rise beyond roughly two to 10, the disease is likely to spread beyond primary and secondary contacts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Primary contacts are people who have had direct, close contact with an infected person, such as household members, caregivers or close colleagues. Secondary contacts are those who have not met the infected person but have been in close contact with a primary contact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If households of primary contacts are quarantined when just two cases are detected, the outbreak can almost certainly be contained, the research found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time 10 cases are identified, it is overwhelmingly likely that the infection has already spread into the wider population, making its trajectory virtually indistinguishable from a scenario with no early intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To keep the study grounded in real-world conditions, the researchers chose a model of a single village in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu - the heart of India's poultry belt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Namakkal is home to more than 1,600 poultry farms and some 70 million chickens; it produces over 60 million eggs a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A village of 9,667 residents was generated using a synthetic community - households, workplaces, market spaces - and seeded with infected birds to mimic real-life exposure. (A synthetic community is an artificial, computer-generated population that mimics the characteristics and behaviours of a real population.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the simulation, the virus starts at one workplace -  a mid-sized farm or wet market - spreads first to people there (primary contacts), and then moves outward to others (seconday contacts) they interact with through homes, schools and other workplaces.  Homes, schools and workplaces formed a fixed network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By tracking primary and secondary infections, the researchers estimated key transmission metrics, including the basic reproductive number, R0 - which measures how many people, on average, one infected person passes the virus on to. In the absence of a real-world pandemic, the researchers instead modelled a range of plausible transmission speeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then they tested what happens when different interventions - culling birds, quarantining close contacts and targeted vaccination - kicked in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were blunt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Culling of birds works - but only if done before the virus infects a human. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If a spillover does occur, timing becomes everything, the researchers found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Isolating infected people and quarantining households can stop the virus at the secondary stage. But once tertiary infections appear - friends of friends, or contacts of contacts - the outbreak slips out of control unless authorities impose much tougher measures, including lockdowns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Targeted vaccination helps by raising the threshold at which the virus can sustain itself, though it does little to change the immediate risk within households.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Chicks at a poultry farm in Kachhawa village, near Karnal, Haryana, India.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">India's poultry industry is one of the world's largest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The simulations also highlighted an awkward trade-off. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quarantine, introduced too early, keeps families together for long stretches - and increases the chance that infected individuals will pass the virus to those they live with. Introduced too late, it does little to slow the outbreak at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say this approach comes with caveats. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The model relies on one synthetic village, with fixed household sizes, workplaces and daily movement patterns. It does not include simultaneous outbreaks seeded by migratory birds or by poultry networks. Nor does it account for behavioural shifts - mask-wearing, for instance - once people know birds are dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Atlanta-based Emory University, adds another caveat: this simulation model \"assumes a very efficient transmission of influenza viruses\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Transmission is complex and not every strain will have the same efficiency as another,\" she says, adding that scientists are also now starting to understand that not all people infected with seasonal flu spread the virus equally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says emerging research shows that only a \"subset of flu-positive individuals actually shed infectious influenza virus into the air\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This mirrors the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51447143\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">super-spreader phenomenon</a> seen with Covid-19, though it is far less well characterised for flu - a gap that could strongly influence how the virus spreads through human populations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What happens if H5N1 becomes successful in the human population?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Lakdawala believes that it \"will cause a large disruption likely more similar to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-%28h1n1%29-outbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2009 [swine flu] pandemic</a> rather than Covid-19\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is because we are more prepared for an influenza pandemic. We have known licensed antivirals that are effective against the H5N1 strains as an early defence and stockpiled candidate<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations/zoonotic-influenza-viruses-and-candidate-vaccine-viruses\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> H5 vaccines</a> that could be deployed in the short term.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But complacency would be a mistake. Dr Lakdawala says if H5N1 becomes established in humans, it could re-assort - or intermingle - with existing strains, amplifying its public-health impact. Such mixing could reshape seasonal influenza, triggering \"chaotic and unpredictable seasonal epidemics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indian modellers say the simulations can be run in real time and updated as data come in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With refinements - better reporting delays, asymptomatic cases - they could give public-health officials something priceless in the early hours of an outbreak: a sense of which actions matter most, before the window for containment snaps shut.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
