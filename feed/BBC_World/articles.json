Much depends on America, because Russia pays the greatest attention to American strength,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has not commented on the prospect of bilateral talks, but Trump wrote on social media that he looked forward to meeting with presidents Zelensky and Putin \"soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the White House's relative optimism, European leaders seemed doubtful that after almost four years of war peace could be within reach. France's Emmanuel Macron said he saw \"no Russian will for a ceasefire\", while Downing Street warned there was \"a long way to go – a tough road ahead.\" </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Explosions rock Kyiv after overnight Russian strikes</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's European allies, the \"Coalition of the Willing\", held a virtual meeting chaired by Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the call – which was also joined by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio – the leaders agreed to set up a task force to \"solidify\" the security guarantees that will be offered to Ukraine in the event of a peace deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue of security guarantees is only one of the areas on which Moscow and Kyiv are at odds. On Monday, Zelensky said the \"main problem\" blocking peace was Putin's demand for legal recognition of the territory Russia had seized.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow has consistently demanded full Ukrainian withdrawal from the whole of the eastern Donbas, made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russian forces also control the Crimean peninsula and large parts of two other regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest round of diplomacy came after Russia carried out heavy strikes on Ukraine on Monday into Tuesday, firing 22 missiles and more than 460 drones on targets across the country. The attacks resulted in the deaths of 14 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the Russian defence ministry said it had intercepted 249 Ukrainian drones overnight, including over the Black Sea and Kursk, and that at least three people had been killed in the southern Rostov region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of soldiers and thousands of civilians have been killed or injured, and millions of people have fled their homes since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

This includes plans for the governance of Gaza, the withdrawal of Israeli troops, the disarmament of Hamas and reconstruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted during the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, during which about 1,200 other people were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 69,770 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

I genuinely believed that it was my last chance, so I just opened a livestream and called for help,\" she said in a video message to her British lawyer, David Haigh.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Javadli was speaking from her house in Dubai, where she claims that she and her three daughters have essentially once again been isolated since she took them back with her after they'd been with their father for several weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Up until then, Ms Javadli had had effective custody of the children under a deal she says was agreed with the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, in 2022. That agreement, she says, guaranteed her custody of the children until they were 18 years old, as well as a house and other assistance. Their schooling has been paid for by their father.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In return, David Haigh says she had to sign papers saying that she would - among other things - not speak to the media again about her situation, nor would she do any more livestreaming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A subsequent court ruling granted custody to Sheikh Saeed, but Ms Javadli says she received assurances from those involved in her case that the deal with Dubai's ruler would not be affected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That remained the situation until two months ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was when - during one of the regular visitations of the children with Sheikh Saeed - that Ms Javadli says she received a message from him through Dubai police telling her there was no need to wait as they would not be returned to her that day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She heard nothing from them for several weeks. She was finally granted a visitation for three hours at a child protection centre and headed there with her driver on 8 November. She says that when she entered the centre, her children were not there. As she was coming out of the building, she saw them. She says they rushed towards her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says they were shouting \"Mama, take us from here!\" She told her driver to lock the doors and drive them home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she claims their way was blocked by cars belonging to people working for her ex-husband. That was when she decided to open a livestream and plead for help. In doing so, she knew that she risked breaking the deal she had signed with the authorities in the UAE and that she could face arrest for doing so, but she insists that it was her only recourse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has been at home with her children since then and says she does not dare to go out for fear of arrest. The three girls - aged nine, seven and six - have not been going to school.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted a number of officials in the UAE, who are involved in the case, for comment, but has received no reply so far. However, the perspective of Sheikh Saeed is clear from court depositions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent gives a very different version of what happened on 8 November, accusing Ms Javadli of forcibly placing the children into her car with the help of her driver and then kidnapping them. It also accuses Ms Javadli of posting videos on social media in which \"she insulted and slandered\" her former husband as well as defaming the state and violating state laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously, lawyers acting for Sheikh Saeed had claimed in court that Ms Javadli was an unfit mother, who had failed to send her daughters to school, was living in a place unsuitable for the children when she was in a hotel, and that she had put the health of the youngest girl at risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Javadli rejected the accusations and her Emirati legal team submitted evidence to the contrary in court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">David Haigh says that there've been other similar cases involving former wives of members of Dubai's royal family or other female members of the family. He himself has been involved in campaigning for several of the women. None of these cases involve Sheikh Saeed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Princess Haya - the ex-wife of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum - fled the UAE in 2019, saying that she feared for her life. Three years later, the princess won a custody battle that played out in the highest court in the UK, which gave her sole custody of their two children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most sensational saga was that of one of the daughters of Dubai's ruler, Princess Latifa, who mounted a bid for freedom in 2018 from what at the time she claimed was her family's coercive control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boat on which she was making her escape was intercepted in the Indian Ocean and she was forcibly returned to Dubai. She then claimed that she was being held captive in secret videos. She has since re-emerged to a limited extent in public, saying that she was well and living as she wished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Javadli and David Haigh say that Dubai portrays itself as promoting women's rights and encouraging women - whether from the UAE or from outside - to lead fulfilling lives, both professionally and personally. For many, this is no doubt the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they claim that Ms Javadli's case shows that beneath the glittering surface of Dubai, for some women the situation can be more complicated and more uncomfortable.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The attacks took place in Germany and in the Hungarian capital Budapest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The six men and one woman who are on trial face charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault, and property damage.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have been named only as Henry A, Tobias E, Johann G, Thomas J, Melissa K, Paul M and Julian W, in line with German privacy laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to prosecutors, the attacks, which went on for several years, were prepared for \"intensively\" and included, for example, spying on the targets in advance. In several cases victims were severely injured with blows from a hammer and batons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the seven defendants, Johann G, is charged with having a prominent role in the group. He is accused of having planned the attacks and recruited members. Prosecutors say that another defendant, Paul M, organised combat training for the group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one attack, in January 2019, Johann G, Tobias E and others are alleged to have attacked four people at Germany's Dessau-Rosslau train station who were on their way back from a rally in Magdeburg, marking the anniversary of the World War Two bombing of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defendants are accused of striking the victims on the head with heavy tools, including a hammer and an iron bar.

He was the oldest South Korean actor to ever win the honour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You become old when you sit down and expect to be waited on,\" he told fellow senior actors on the travel show Grandpas over Flowers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2013 show, which revolves around senior stars making strenuous journeys abroad, became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Born in 1934 in Hoeryeong, a county now in North Korea, Lee was just four years old when his family moved south to Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was working in his grandparents' shop in the capital's Namdaemun market when Korea was liberated from Japanese rule in 1945.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee studied philosophy at the prestigious Seoul National University but ventured into theatre and, eventually, TV and films. He said he was inspired to act after watching Sir Laurence Olivier play the title role in Hamlet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee appeared in some 140 TV shows through his career and continued to act on stage until October 2024, when he withdrew halfway through the run of the play Waiting for Godot because of an illness. He reappeared in public at the awards in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also had a brief foray into politics. In 1992, he was elected as a member of parliament for the conservative Democratic Liberal Party, but at the end of his four-year-term he did not run again. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bfb0/live/29b1cfd0-c9c3-11f0-a001-47048321ca07.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images South Korean actors Baek Il-Sub, Lee Soon-Jae, Shin Gu (Shin Goo) and Park Geun-Hyung attend the press conference for tvN \"Grandpas Over Flowers In Greece\" on March 24, 2015 in Seoul, South Korea.

No arrests have been made. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The county's medical examiner previously said Ms Rivas Hernandez's body was \"severely decomposed\" when it was found in September and deferred making a ruling on how she died pending the death investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When her remains were found in a bag in D4vd's car on 8 September, the medical examiner said that she was wearing a tube top, size small black leggings and jewellery, including a yellow metal stud earring and a yellow metal chain bracelet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also had a tattoo that read \"Shhh…\" on her index finger - a marking nearly identical to that on the pop singer's own index finger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decomposition of her body indicated that she had already been \"deceased for several weeks\", investigators said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The girl, who lived about 75 miles away from where her body was discovered - had run away from her home repeatedly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neighbours recognised the first-generation daughter of immigrant parents from El Salvador, as a girl who would visit the corner store almost daily to buy candy and soda, according to the Los Angeles Times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her family, who described her as a beloved daughter, sister, cousin and friend, said they were \"heartbroken and devastated by this tragic loss\". They solicited money on a crowdfunding website to pay for her funeral, which took place in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case has also derailed the aspiring career of the viral hitmaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His world tour was cancelled within days of the discovery, and Sony Music Publishing reportedly suspended promotion of his second album.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Los Angeles police soon raided the posh Hollywood Hills mansion where the singer was living, just blocks from where his Tesla had been towed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US retailer Hollister and footwear giant Crocs dropped D4vd from marketing campaigns and Telepatía singer Kali Uchis announced she was taking down their collaboration, Crashing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Until recently, he was mostly known for discussions of budgets, supplies and staff issues in the military's largest branch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll does not appear have a long history of dealing with Russian and Ukraine, or experience in international diplomacy, and has never held public office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, who is this increasingly prominent figure within the administration?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Close ally of Vice-President JD Vance</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is Driscoll's relationship with the now-vice president, JD Vance, that brought him into Trump's orbit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like his friend Vance, Driscoll attended a public university before joining the US Army, and then earned his law degree at the prestigious Yale University. Both men also worked in finance after graduating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his military career, Driscoll became an officer in 2007, led a cavalry platoon and deployed to Iraq for several months in 2009. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has told the story of meeting Vance through a veterans' student group at law school, during which Vance reassured new students that they would at first feel as if they did not belong, but would excel at classes after a few months. Soon, Vance became Driscoll's friend and mentor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll was on holiday with his family in Switzerland in the summer of 2024 when Vance called to tell him he was going to be Trump's running mate and asked him to join the campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next day, Driscoll flew back to the US, bought a suit at an outlet mall, and took an Uber to the Republican National Convention, he told the alumni magazine for the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill - the institution where he was an undergraduate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once Trump returned to office, Driscoll was swiftly approved as army secretary in his Senate confirmation vote. His sphere of influence expanded after he became a key figure in Trump's deployment of the National Guard to US cities. Afterwards, he also took over the role of acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9a6b/live/e57e9ba0-ca11-11f0-b881-37f4ac070994.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Dan Driscoll, wearing a blue suit jacket and red tie, looks up and over to his left behind a small black microphone \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Driscoll at his confirmation hearing in January</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Unannounced visit to Ukraine</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll has often spoken about the war in Ukraine - pointing to Ukrainian drones as a relatively cheap, mass-produced technology that is good for fighting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after being nominated for the army secretary job, he did not initially appear to be involved in negotiations to end the war. Trump was instead relying on his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to work on a plan for a ceasefire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When details of a 28-point plan drafted by the US and Russia <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">were leaked last week</a>, Ukraine immediately voiced concern at some of its key points - and its European allies followed suit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll then made an unannounced visit to Ukraine along with other high-ranking Pentagon figures, the most senior military group to travel to Kyiv since Trump took office in January. The purpose, according to a US Army spokesman, was to meet Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driscoll met Zelensky and was then, according to Politico, feted at a reception at the US ambassador's residence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In subsequent days, Driscoll participated in more discussions with Ukrainian officials in Geneva alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and helped draw up an<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce3zwy808dpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> \"updated and refined peace framework\"</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to hold talks with Russian officials in Abu Dhabi, according to the BBC's US partner, CBS News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a social media post on Tuesday, Trump said in an effort to finalise the peace plan, he had directed his envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.

A former professor has suggested Driscoll aimed \"to serve in the military, go to law school and be in politics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the possibility Driscoll could step officially into the role of negotiating with Ukraine when Trump's special envoy to the country, Keith Kellogg, leaves in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Or he could stay as the head of hundreds of thousands of troops in the US Army. Driscoll has previously highlighted that his father and grandfather served in the military before him, and he often speaks about his vision of transforming the Army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days before heading to Ukraine, Driscoll described to The Conversation podcast how he imagined the near future, when \"every infantryman...will carry a drone into battle\" and soldiers would rely on artificial intelligence because human brains will not be able to \"keep up\" with the pace of action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our window to change is right now,\" he said in a speech in October. \"And we will win with silicon and software, not our soldiers' blood and bodies.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It provides protection for people already in the US who are from countries hit by war or natural disaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But TPS is due to end for 350,000 Haitians in February, as part of US President Donald Trump's sweeping changes to immigration policies.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62c7/live/3117aa90-c0ba-11f0-9a85-7f5796336073.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Liam Weir/BBC Marven looking on and smiling as a man brings a birthday cake with lit candles to the table where he and some other people are sitting.

In just a few months, the two women could be deported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the earthquake, Guerline lived in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince, struggling to provide for her children. She says offering Marven for adoption \"scarred\" her, but she \"wanted a better life for him\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacey, who now renovates properties after a career in the corporate world, says she felt compelled to adopt a child from Haiti in the aftermath of the disaster and raised Marven alongside her two biological children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, hearing about the violence, she began researching legal routes to the US for Rochelle and Guerline. When a humanitarian scheme opened in 2023, they applied immediately. \"Three weeks later they were approved and on an airplane and here with us,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two Haitian women moved into a caravan on Stacey's driveway, before renting an apartment locally. Guerline now works in a hotel. Rochelle has jobs at a supermarket and a nursery, and dreams of becoming a nurse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marven often sleeps over at their apartment and loves the Haitian food Guerline cooks. He says his life now \"feels more complete\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Rochelle and Guerline are terrified of returning to Haiti. The gang violence has displaced a tenth of the population, according to the UN, with kidnappings and killings rising sharply.

When she wakes up, she will regain consciousness more quickly and clearly because she required lower doses of anaesthetic drugs such as propofol and opioid painkillers than patients who heard no music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That, at least, is what a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mmd.iammonline.com/index.php/musmed/article/view/1111\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new peer-reviewed study</a> from Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital suggests. The research, published in the journal Music and Medicine, offers some of the strongest evidence yet that music played during general anaesthesia can modestly but meaningfully reduce drug requirements and improve recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study focuses on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the standard keyhole operation to remove the gallbladder. The procedure is short - usually under an hour - and demands a particularly swift, \"clear-headed\" recovery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To understand why the researchers turned to music, it helps to decode the modern practice of anaesthesia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our aim is early discharge after surgery,\" says Dr Farah Husain, senior specialist in anaesthesia and certified music therapist for the study. \"Patients need to wake up clear-headed, alert and oriented, and ideally pain-free. With better pain management, the stress response is curtailed.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Achieving that requires a carefully balanced mix of five or six drugs that together keep the patient asleep, block pain, prevent memory of the surgery and relax the muscles.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1dd7/live/f3017100-c2c1-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Indian surgeons medical team performing surgery in operation theater at hospital\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Patients need to wake up clear-headed and ideally pain-free after surgery</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In procedures like laparoscopic gallbladder removal, anaesthesiologists now often supplement this drug regimen with regional \"blocks\" - ultrasound-guided injections that numb nerves in the abdominal wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"General anaesthesia plus blocks is the norm,\" says Dr Tanvi Goel, primary investigator and a former senior resident of Maulana Azad Medical College. \"We've been doing this for decades.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the body does not take to surgery easily. Even under anaesthesia, it reacts: heart rate rises, hormones surge, blood pressure spikes. Reducing and managing this cascade is one of the central goals of modern surgical care. Dr Husain explains that the stress response can slow recovery and worsen inflammation, highlighting why careful management is so important.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stress starts even before the first cut, with intubation - the insertion of a breathing tube into the windpipe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To do this, the anaesthesiologist uses a laryngoscope to lift the tongue and soft tissues at the base of the throat, obtain a clear view of the vocal cords, and guide the tube into the trachea. It's a routine step in general anaesthesia that keeps the airway open and allows precise control of the patient's breathing while they are unconscious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The laryngoscopy and intubation are considered the most stressful response during general anaesthesia,\" says Dr Sonia Wadhawan, director-professor of anaesthesia and intensive care at Maulana Azad Medical College and supervisor of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Although the patient is unconscious and will remember nothing, their body still reacts to the stress with changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and stress hormones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be sure, the drugs have evolved. The old ether masks have vanished. In their place are intravenous agents - most notably propofol, the hypnotic made infamous by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-15634083\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Michael Jackson's death</a> but prized in operating theatres for its rapid onset and clean recovery. \"Propofol acts within about 12 seconds,\" notes Dr Goel. \"We prefer it for short surgeries like laparoscopic cholecystectomy because it avoids the 'hangover' caused by inhalational gases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team of researchers wanted to know whether music could reduce how much propofol and fentanyl (an opioid painkiller) patients required. Less drugs means faster awakening, steadier vital signs and reduced side effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So they designed a study. A pilot involving eight patients led to a full 11-month trial of 56 adults, aged roughly 20 to 45, randomly assigned to two groups. All received the same five-drug regimen: a drug that prevents nausea and vomiting, a sedative, fentanyl, propofol and a muscle relaxant. Both groups wore noise-cancelling headphones - but only one heard music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We asked patients to select from two calming instrumental pieces - soft flute or piano,\" says Dr Husain. \"The unconscious mind still has areas that remain active. Even if the music isn't explicitly recalled, implicit awareness can lead to beneficial effects.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A pilot involving eight patients led to a full trial of 56 adults randomly assigned to two groups </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were striking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Patients exposed to music required lower doses of propofol and fentanyl. They experienced smoother recoveries, lower cortisol or stress-hormone levels and a much better control of blood pressure during the surgery. \"Since the ability to hear remains intact under anaesthesia,\" the researchers write, \"music can still shape the brain's internal state.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clearly, music seemed to quieten the internal storm. \"The auditory pathway remains active even when you're unconscious,\" says Dr Wadhawan. \"You may not remember the music, but the brain registers it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea that the mind behind the anaesthetic veil is not entirely silent has long intrigued scientists. Rare cases of \"intraoperative awareness\" show patients recalling fragments of operating-room conversation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the brain is capable of picking up and remembering stressful experiences during surgery - even when a patient is unconscious - then it might also be able to register positive or comforting experiences, like music, even without conscious memory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're only beginning to explore how the unconscious mind responds to non-pharmacological interventions like music,\" says Dr Husain. \"It's a way of humanising the operating room.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music therapy is not new to medicine; it has long been used in psychiatry, stroke rehabilitation and palliative care. But its entry into the intensely technical, machine-governed world of anaesthesia marks a quiet shift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If such a simple intervention can reduce drug use and speed recovery - even modestly - it could reshape how hospitals think about surgical wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the research team prepares its next study exploring music-aided sedation, building on earlier findings, one truth is already humming through the data: even when the body is still and the mind asleep, it appears a few gentle notes can help the healing begin.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

So Kyiv had to engage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday night, Marco Rubio declared there'd been \"tremendous progress\" in the talks with just a \"couple of things\" still outstanding. When pressed, he wouldn't be more specific, calling the situation \"delicate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a joint Ukraine-US statement says there's now a whole new deal in play, which it calls an \"updated and revised framework document\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We haven't seen that yet. The Financial Times newspaper quotes one of the delegates, though -<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Ukraine's deputy foreign minister<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Sergiy Kyslytsya - who talks of a new 19-point plan with \"very little left\" from the original draft.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That new document likely incorporates at least some of the amendments proposed by the Europeans and published by Reuters news agency that point to something far more palatable for Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that version, an automatic veto on future Ukrainian Nato membership is gone - as well as a cap on troop numbers for the country's armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It says no Western troops would be deployed to Ukraine permanently, but that's not an all-out ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the sensitive question of territory – land Ukrainian soldiers have been fighting and dying to defend for 11 years – there would be no handover of the rest of the Donbas region to Russia for free, and Ukraine would aim to recover occupied areas through exclusively diplomatic means. That's something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky previously accepted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full amnesty for war crimes is deleted, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most critically, there's reference to security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have talked about Ukraine getting Article 5-style protection, meaning the US would be bound to come to its defence if Russia ever invaded again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's the key issue which Ukraine says it can't negotiate on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We don't know how many of these European ideas have made it into the new proposal, but Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz calls the deal \"significantly modified\" – in a positive sense.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So how did we get from a pro-Russian deal to this in just a day? It's hard to be sure, with US hawks like President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff in the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The initial Kremlin-friendly plan was rooted in Witkoff's own visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin this spring, when he returned quoting Russia's controversial narratives almost verbatim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, this plan seems like something Ukraine might sign up to – eventually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which must be why Trump has gone from berating officials in Kyiv, again, for supposedly showing him \"zero gratitude\", to proclaiming that \"something good\" may be coming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how good? There is still no sign that Russia is ready to give up fighting unless it's forced to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin is much more self-confident militarily, right now,\" Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center believes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She points to a corruption scandal and political crisis in Kyiv, problems mobilising soldiers there, and military gains for Russian forces on the ground – all driving Putin's thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At best, some suggest Trump's demand for a deal has injected new momentum into efforts to find peace, which Ukrainians, under fire, desperately want.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's hard to escape the sense that these days of frantic diplomacy have only brought us back to where we started</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's position is, 'we have laid out our demands, so do you take them or not?' Stanovaya said. \"'If so, we will stop the war – if not, we'll just wait until you're ready.'\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The designation gives it another way to turn up the heat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But questions have been raised as to whether Cartel de los Soles actually exists and Venezuela's foreign ministry has \"categorically, firmly, and absolutely rejected\" the designation, which it describes as a \"new and ridiculous lie\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

eZyhnA\">Cabello, who is alleged to be one of the high-ranking members of the cartel, has accused US officials of using it as an excuse to target those they do not like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whenever someone bothers them, they name them as the head of the Cartel de los Soles,\" he said in August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo Petro, the left-wing president of Venezuela's neighbour, Colombia, has also denied the cartel's existence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is the fictional excuse of the far right to bring down governments that do not obey them,\" he wrote on X in August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the US state department is adamant that the Cartel de los Soles not only exists but that it has \"corrupted Venezuela's

the country was bearing fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As established smuggling routes came under pressure, Mr Benítez-Manau argues, the Cartel de los Soles began providing alternative

Under Ukraine's constitution, elections cannot be held during in time of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are signs of growing frustration with the current government which is facing serious allegations of corruption. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) is currently investigating allegations of individuals profiting from contracts in the energy sector to the tune of $100m (£76m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Volodymyr Zelensky has already been forced to sack two of his ministers, both of whom deny the allegations. A former deputy prime minister and business partner are also under investigation. The scandal has led to political infighting and has dominated the headlines here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a live topic on the front too. Among those soldiers we spoke to there is support for fresh elections. \"Of course they are needed – those in power right now are not trusted,\" says Snake. Another soldier, Marin, is also in favour of elections, saying that the current government \"needs to be cleansed of corruption\", while Andrii agrees that a \"complete reset of government is needed\" through fresh elections, though not right away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections may well be the least controversial proposal in the plan. But overall there are serious misgivings about the US proposals. Yaroslav tells us it simply \"won't work\" while Oleksandr dismisses it with an expletive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one clear message from those we talked to is that many are tired of fighting. Andrii has concerns about some of the proposals but concludes: \"If it stops the war, then it works for me.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Yet a continuing dispute over the buses that take visitors up to the mountain-top site recently saw some 1,400 stranded tourists needing to be evacuated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cristian Alberto Caballero Chacón is head of operations for bus company Consettur, which for the past 30 years has transported some 4,500 people every day to Machu Picchu from the local town of Aguas Calientes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a 20-minute journey, and the only alternative is an arduous, steep, two-hour walk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He admits that in the past few months \"there have been some conflicts between people from different communities here\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This conflict revolves around Consettur losing its licence to a rival bus firm in this remote part of Peru, where, unless you want to hike over Andes mountains, the only access is by public transport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get to Machu Picchu without walking, tourists must first take a train to Aguas Calientes, which takes from two to three and a half hours.

He says it was difficult to arrange because they weren't doing it through an expensive guided tour. A standard adult price for Machu Picchu is $57.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mayor of Aguas Calientes, Elvis La Torre, is also unhappy about the entry tickets, because he says that most of the revenues do not stay locally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Only 10% of the ticket sales stay in the region.

They killed my child and now there is just silence,\" Sallay Kalokoh told BBC Africa Eye, explaining how her son Papayo was found with parts of his body removed, including his vital organs, eyes and one arm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had gone out to sell fish at the market and never came back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family searched for him for two weeks - and finally found his mutilated corpse at the bottom of a well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We always tell our children to be careful. If you are selling, don't go to a corner or take gifts from strangers. It happens frequently in this country,\" Ms Kalokoh said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This murder in my hometown of Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, has haunted me as we often hear of reports of killings linked to black magic, also known as juju, that are never followed up or properly investigated by the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Papayo's case, the police did not even confirm that it was a \"ritual killing\" - when a person is murdered so that parts of their body can be used in so-called magic rituals by illicit juju practitioners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They promise things like prosperity and power to clients who pay large sums in the false belief that human body parts can make such charms more potent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with the authorities severely under-resourced - there is only one pathologist in a country that has a population of 8.9 million - it is often impossible to gather the evidence needed to track down the culprits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belief in witchcraft is also so deeply ingrained in Sierra Leone, even among many police officers, that there is often a fear of pursuing cases further - and most go unsolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I wanted to find out more about this underground trade in human body parts that leaves tragedy in its wake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our BBC Africa Eye team was able to find two people who claimed they were juju practitioners and offered to obtain body parts for ritual purposes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both said they were part of much larger networks - and one boasted that he had powerful clients across West Africa. The BBC was unable to verify these claims.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One member of our team went undercover, using the name Osman, to pose as a politician who wanted to achieve power through human sacrifice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We first travelled to a remote area of Kambia district, in the north of the country near the Guinean border, to meet the juju man in his secret shrine - an area in dense bush where he consulted with his clients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Calling himself Kanu, he wore a ceremonial red mask covering his whole face to conceal his identity and boasted of his political connections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was working with some big, big politicians in Guinea, Senegal and Nigeria. We have our team. Sometimes during election time, at night, this place is full of people,\" he claimed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Election season is regarded by some as a particularly dangerous time <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-43588465\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">when parents have been warned to take special care of their children because of the heightened risk of abductions</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a second visit, Kanu became more confident and showed Osman what he said was evidence of his trade - a human skull.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You see this? This belongs to someone. I dried it for them. It is a woman's skull. I am expecting the person to pick this up today or tomorrow.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also pointed to a pit behind his shrine: \"This is where we hang human parts. We slaughter here, and the blood goes down there… Even big chiefs, when they want power, come here. I give them what they want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Osman specified that he wanted limbs from a woman to be used in a ritual, Kanu got down to business: \"The price of a woman is 70m leones [£2,500; $3,000].\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sierra Leone is one of the world's poorest countries and is recovering from the legacy of a brutal 11-year civil war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anxious not to put anyone at risk, we did not meet Kanu again. He may have been a scammer, but we handed over our evidence to the local police to investigate further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such juju men sometimes refer to themselves as herbalists, the name given to healers who use traditional medicine often made from local plants to treat common illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.who.int/indicators/i/CCCEBB2/217795A\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">World Health Organization data</a> shows that Sierra Leone - which suffered a brutal civil war in the 1990s and was at the centre of the Ebola epidemic a decade ago - had around 1,000 registered doctors in 2022, compared to reported estimates of 45,000 traditional healers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most people in the West African nation rely on these healers, who also help with mental health issues and treat their patients in shrines where there is an element of mysticism and spiritualism culturally associated with their craft and the remedies they sell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheku Tarawallie, president of Sierra Leone's Council of Traditional Healers, is adamant that \"diabolic\" juju men like Kanu are giving healers a bad name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are trying very hard to clear our image. The ordinary person doesn't understand, so they class us [all] as bad herbalists. One rotting fish can destroy the batch of fish… We are healers, we are not killers,\" he told BBC Africa Eye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Tarawallie is in fact trying to work with the government and another non-governmental organisation to open a traditional medicine clinic to treat patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was those with a lust for power and money who were often behind the ritual killings, he believed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When somebody wants to become a leader… they remove parts from human beings. They use that one as a sacrifice. Burn people, use their ashes for power. Use their oil for power.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Undercover filming of a man who said he was a juju practitioner and claimed to sell human body parts</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of ritual killings in Sierra Leone, where most people identify as Muslim or Christian, is not known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In most African countries, ritual murders are not officially recorded as a separate or sub-category of homicide,\" Emmanuel Sarpong Owusu, a lecturer at the UK's Arden University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some are misclassified or misreported as accidents, deaths resulting from attacks by wild animals, suicides, natural deaths… Most perpetrators - possibly 90% - are not apprehended.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When we found another suspected supplier of body parts, he was located in a suburb of the capital, Freetown, called Waterloo, which is notorious for drug abuse and other crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not alone, I have up to 250 herbalists working under my banner,\" the man calling himself Idara told Osman, who was again undercover and wearing a secret camera.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are no human parts that we don't work with. Once we call for a specific body part, then they bring it. We share the work,\" Idara said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to explain how some of his collaborators were good at capturing people - and on Osman's second visit played a voice message from one of them who claimed they were prepared to start going out every night in search of a victim.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osman told him not to proceed yet but when he later received a call from Idara claiming his team had identified a victim, we contacted Police Commissioner Ibrahim Sama.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He decided to organise a raid - but said his officers would not do so without the involvement of Mr Tarawallie, who often assists the police on such operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we got intelligence that there is a particular dangerous witchdoctor operating a shrine, we will work with the traditional healers,\" said an officer on the raid, Assistant Superintendent Aliu Jallo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to express the superstitions some officers have about tackling rogue herbalists: \"I will not go and provoke situations. I know that they have their own powers that are beyond my knowledge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Idara was captured - discovered hiding in the roof clutching a knife - Mr Tarawallie began searching the property for evidence, saying there were human bones, human hair and piles of what looked like dirt from cemeteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was enough for the police to arrest Idara and two other men, who were charged in June with practising sorcery as well as being in possession of traditional weapons used in ritual killings. They pleaded not guilty to the charges and have since been granted bail, pending further investigations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The police raided this house in Waterloo and arrested the occupants, including Idara, who were later charged under anti-witchcraft laws</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we never heard back from the police in Kambia about Kanu, I tried to call him myself to challenge him about the allegations directly, but he was unreachable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are occasions when even high-profile cases appear to stall. Two years ago, a university lecturer went missing in Freetown and his body was later found buried in what police say was the shrine of a herbalist in Waterloo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case was referred in August 2023 by a magistrate to the High Court for trial, but two sources have told the BBC it has not been pursued so far and those detained by police have been released on bail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My family is facing similar hurdles finding justice. In May, during our BBC investigation, my 28-year-old cousin Fatmata Conteh was murdered in Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hairdresser and mother of two, her body was dumped the day after her birthday by the side of the road where a resident told the BBC two other bodies had been found in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several of her front teeth were missing, leading the community to believe it was a ritual killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was a lady that never did harm. She was very peaceful and hard-working,\" said one mourner as family, friends and colleagues gathered for a big funeral at her local mosque.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We may never know the true motive for Fatmata's murder. The family paid for her body to be transported to Freetown for an autopsy - something the authorities could not afford to do - but the post-mortem was inconclusive and no arrests have yet been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is the case for Papayo's mother, the lack of closure and feeling of abandonment by the police fuels fear and terror in poor communities like Makeni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-chris-alcock-and-luis-barrucho\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Chris Alcock and Luis Barrucho</i></p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More BBC Africa Eye stories from Sierra Leone:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
