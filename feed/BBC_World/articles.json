India is the world's fastest growing major economy.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was happy. Washington less so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, the Trump administration slapped <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dxr1g4y7yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an additional 25% tariff</a> on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's geopolitics at play, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn0r02zgjj4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">smiling and chatting together</a> sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a \"multi-polar world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia lauds its \"no limits partnership\" with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is just as vocal about its \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,\" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe. Now we're not. This is a big failure and a big loss. I'm sure that part of Russia's political and entrepreneurial class is dreaming of returning to Europe and of doing business not only with China and India.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, though, expect to hear about Russia-India friendship, trade deals and increased economic cooperation between Moscow and Delhi.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aca3/live/edcc0f70-d02b-11f0-8d66-e797ff22b6b0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian S400 drives on their way to Red Square during the general rehearsal of Victory Day military parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II, at Red Square in Moscow, Russia on 7 May 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Weapon sales to India are a priority for Russia</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Test of Modi's strategic autonomy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"by-vikas-pandey\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"by-vikas-pandey\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">By Vikas Pandey</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin's visit to Delhi is coming at a crucial time for Modi and India's global ambitions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India-Russia ties go back to the Soviet era and have endured irrespective of the changing geopolitical landscape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has arguably put more time and energy into this relationship than other Russian leaders before him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Modi, despite coming under intense pressure from Western governments to criticise Russia over its war in Ukraine, he maintained that dialogue was the only way to resolve the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was India's \"strategic autonomy\" at play – with Modi occupying a particular place in the geopolitical order where he held close ties with Moscow while maintaining his relationship with the West at the same time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That worked - until Trump returned to the White House. India-US ties have hit <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15lqe7v302o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an all-time low</a> in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his \"true friend\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/international/world-wants-the-ukraine-war-to-end-but-russia-doesnt-seem-serious-about-peace/articleshow/125675348.cms\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">joint article</a> in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,\" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21, 2025 in Washington, DC\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India as penalty for buying Russian oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Threads, similar to X, can only be accessed via an Instagram account.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia's world-first social media ban starts on 10 December, with companies facing fines of up to A$49.5m (US$33m, £25m) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from having accounts.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for Meta told the BBC on Thursday that \"compliance with the law will be an ongoing and multi-layered process\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While Meta is committed to complying with the law, we believe a more effective, standardised, and privacy-preserving approach is needed,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government should require app stores to verify the age of users when they download apps and ask for parental approval for under-16s, Meta said, as this would eliminate the need for teens to verify their age across different apps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Meta said users it had identified as under 16 would be able to download and save their posts, videos and messages before their accounts are deactivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teens who believe they have been wrongly categorised as under 16 can ask for a review and submit a \"video selfie\" to verify their age. They can also provide a driver's licence or a government-issued identification.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alongside Meta's three platforms, the other social media sites affected by the ban are YouTube, X, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick and Twitch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says the ban is aimed at protecting children from the harms of social media but critics say the move may isolate certain groups who depend on platforms for connection and push children to less-regulated corners of the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Communications Minister Anika Wells on Wednesday said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp341gz24p5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">she expected teething problems</a> in the first few days and weeks of the ban but it was about protecting Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - and future generations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">described by the man who created the feature</a> as behavioural cocaine,\" Wells said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She described youngsters as being connected to a \"dopamine drip\" from the moment they got a smartphone and social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wells also said that she was closely watching lesser-known apps like Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - and Yope to see if children were migrating to those platforms after the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant wrote to Lemon8 and Yope - both are video and photo-sharing apps - asking them to self-assess if they fell under the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yope's chief executive and co-founder Bahram Ismailau said the start-up had not received any inquiries from Inman Grant yet but had already carried out a self-assessment and found it was not a social media platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because in practice Yope functions as a fully private messenger with no public content at all,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yope works much like WhatsApp, Mr Ismailau said, where it's about \"seeing your people every day and sharing your life with them safely and privately\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lemon8 has reportedly said it will exclude under-16s from its platform from next week, despite not being included in the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube, which was originally exempt from the ban but then later included, labelled the law as \"rushed\" and claimed that banning children from having an account - which comes with parental controls - will make its video-sharing platform \"less safe\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia's social media ban, the first of its kind in the world, is being closely watched by global leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government commissioned a study earlier this year which found that 96% of Australian children aged 10-15 used social media, and that seven out of 10 of them had been exposed to harmful content such as misogynistic and violent material as well as content promoting eating disorders and suicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victim of cyberbullying.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In February, the court ruled that Singh's actions were \"strongly indicative\" that he had not wanted Khan to clarify her lie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Singh, who maintained his innocence throughout the trial, argued that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During Singh's appeal hearing in November, his lawyer argued that the court had \"ignored crucial pieces of evidence\" in its ruling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singh's lawyer also sought to cast doubt on the credibility of Khan and her aides, who served as witnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the judge asked why Singh seemed to be \"doing nothing\" to get Khan to own up in the weeks after learning about her lie in parliament, Singh's lawyer said that he had other urgent professional and personal matters to deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the prosecution argued that Singh's inaction, along with other pieces of evidence, proved that he had never intended for Khan to come clean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics have previously accused Singapore's government of using the judiciary to go after its political opponents - charges the authorities have always denied.</p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somali-Americans in Minnesota have told of their heightened fear after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Community leaders told the BBC the \"apprehension is palpable\" following Trump's remarks, in which he said he did not want Somalis in the US and the country would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you're being targeted by the president of the United States, it's not really a good feeling,\" Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council, which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Concern has also intensified because of reports that officials have begun an enforcement operation in Minnesota targeting undocumented immigrants.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awed said the council would discuss the risks of holding an annual event scheduled for next week in-person because of the operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are getting caught up in this are people who don't speak that great of English, but who have been citizens for decades,\" he said. \"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awed said the comments were \"dangerous\", adding it was \"not becoming of a president to be just attacking other Americans\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president was responding to a question about whether Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz should resign over allegations of large-scale fraud in a state social assistance programme.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the Minnesota government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme, which ultimately cost the state tens of millions of dollars, according to Kayseh Magan, a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2024/07/17/a-somali-american-investigator-heres-why-youre-hearing-so-much-about-fraud-in-my-community/\"

Minnesota's large Somali population, Trump has repeatedly criticised the community, writing in a post last month that the state has become a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and alleging last week that \"hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee said it was opening an investigation into Walz's handling of the relief scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration said it was also looking into claims Minnesota tax dollars are being funnelled into al-Shabab, an Islamist group affiliated to al-Qaeda based in Somalia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about those claims last month, Walz said: \"Do not paint an entire group of people with that same brush – demonising them, putting them at risk when there is no proof to do that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if you want to help us and you want to go after the

Yes, people commit crimes, but an entire community should not be blamed based on what some individuals did.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said its enforcement operation would target those who have been issued final deportation orders.

Shortly after, he posted anti-Semitic comments online, which prompted Adidas to pull his products from sale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">West's behaviour also prompted several companies, including Gap and JP Morgan, to sever ties with the rapper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents filed on Wednesday show that HLSA-ILA Funds, the firm representing investors, alleged that Adidas continued its partnership with West despite knowing about his controversial conduct for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The filing claims Adidas \"internally grappled\" with West's behaviour but <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65441303\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">misled shareholders by failing to disclose the risk</a> in its reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ultimately sided with Adidas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court said on Wednesday that a reasonable investor would know that a partnership with a celebrity like West could come with \"inherent risks relating to improper behaviour\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A district court had previously dismissed HLSA-ILA's case, and the firm later appealed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The collapse of Adidas' partnership with West caused the German firm's share price to tank in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yeezy, luxury trainers designed by West, had been a particularly lucrative line of products for Adidas, generating around €1.5bn (£870m; $1.17bn) in sales in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The partnership breakdown left Adidas with more than €1bn worth of Yeezy shoes sitting in storage. In 2023, the brand announced that it would sell those products and donate some of the proceeds to charities who worked on combating hate.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It added that this would be \"similar to the mechanism that operated in January\", when the crossing opened during a previous ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An Israeli security official said it was an expression of Israel's support for the current ceasefire with Hamas, which began seven weeks ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Egypt denied it was co-ordinating with Israel to reopen the Rafah crossing.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The State Information Service cited an official Egyptian source as saying that \"if an agreement is reached to open the crossing, it will be in both directions, to enter and exit the Gaza Strip, in accordance with the plan of US President Donald Trump\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c70155nked7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan</a> states that \"opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism\" implemented under the January ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crossing has been mostly closed since May 2024, when the Palestinian side was seized by Israeli forces. Before then, it was the main exit point for Palestinians allowed to leave during the conflict and a key entry point for humanitarian aid. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 16,500 severely ill or injured Palestinians in need of lifesaving medical treatment abroad are currently waiting to be evacuated from Gaza, according to the World Health Organization. It says only 235 patients, almost all of them children, have been evacuated via crossings with Israel since the ceasefire took effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's Haaretz newspaper reported that Palestinian Authority (PA) forces would assist in operating the reopened Rafah crossing alongside the EU's Border Assistance Mission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It cited a European source as saying Palestinian representatives had also helped during the previous ceasefire but without wearing PA insignia due to \"Israeli sensitivity\" over their presence in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled out any role in the future governance of the territory for the PA, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Haaretz also reported that Netanyahu had so far blocked the reopening of the Rafah crossing because of the delayed return of the bodies of deceased hostages held by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which took effect on 10 October, Hamas agreed to return the 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of the 28 dead Israeli and foreign hostages still in Gaza within 72 hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All the living hostages were released on 13 October in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, the remains of 23 dead Israeli hostages have been handed over, along with those of three foreign hostages – one of them Thai, one Nepalese and one Tanzanian. In exchange, Israel has handed over the bodies of 345 Palestinians killed during the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the remaining dead hostages is Israeli – Ran Gvili, 24 - and the other is a Thai - Suthisak Rintalak, 43.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli prime minister's office said on Wednesday morning that forensic testing had shown that human remains handed over by Hamas in Gaza the previous day did not belong to either of the two men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday afternoon, the military wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, said it had recovered the body of a hostage in northern Gaza. The body will be transferred later to Israeli forces via the Red Cross, according to Hamas's military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two dead hostages still in Gaza were among the 251 people abducted by Hamas and its allies on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel responded to the attack by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 70,100 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kenya's parliament has accused British soldiers of decades of sexual abuse, killings, human rights violations and environmental destruction while training in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report detailed harrowing testimony from communities in Laikipia and Samburu counties, near the military training bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The British soldiers are accused of evading accountability by refusing to cooperate with the parliamentary investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK High Commission in Kenya said it regretted that its submission was not reflected in the report's conclusions and affirmed its readiness to investigate the allegations \"under our jurisdiction fully, once evidence is provided\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For decades, troops from the British Army Training Unit in Kenya (Batuk) have been training in central Kenya but their presence has long attracted controversy, with soldiers accused of misconduct and rights abuses. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 1,000 Kenyan soldiers receive British training each year, while thousands of UK troops are sent to Kenya for training exercises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a 94-page report following a two-year inquiry, Kenya's parliamentary Committee on Defence, Intelligence and Foreign Relations accused Batuk of continued ethical breaches, rights violations and environmental negligence, as well as employment and labour concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The panel cited oral and written submissions from affected civilians, victims, community leaders, civil society organisations and public agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report said that during the inquiry, host communities had complained of killings, assaults and maimings, including public fights and fatal traffic incidents, involving Batuk soldiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report said that Batuk was \"increasingly seen as an occupying presence rather than a development partner, with affected residents drawing parallels to colonial injustices\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the worst cases was the 2012 murder of Agnes Wanjiru, whose body was found in a hotel septic tank in the central garrison town of Nanyuki, nearly three months after she was alleged to have spent an evening with British soldiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The panel said the \"pursuit of justice has been slow and fraught with frustration\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was submitted that the process of investigation has faced undue interference and obstruction, allegedly by Batuk personnel, which continues to hinder the delivery of justice,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former British soldier accused of Wanjiru's murder was arrested last month after a warrant was issued in the UK and he now faces extradition to Kenya. He has denied the charge, and his lawyers said he intended to contest the extradition.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another case was the \"unlawful killing\" of herder Tilam Leresh allegedly by a Batuk sergeant in 2012, \"yet no arrest or prosecution has taken place in either Kenya or the UK\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has previously expressed regret over Leresh's shooting by an on-duty British soldier, but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/68f8bccfec6267c615ed8f82/BATUK_Inquiry_Written_Statement.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in a statement to the parliamentary committee in October, the Ministry of Defence noted that British prosecutors had concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring charges</a>. The UK said it remained open to considering any new evidence that might emerge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report also noted \"disturbing trends of sexual misconduct by Batuk personnel\" and claimed that survivors of sexual violence reported cases being dropped or mishandled by local authorities, with \"many victims denied access to justice\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It cited \"compelling evidence\" of widespread sexual violence perpetrated by Batuk soldiers particularly against women from the Samburu and Maasai communities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Cases of rape and sexual violence by Batuk soldiers remain unresolved, and justice has not been served to the victims.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report documented testimony from victims, detailing how British soldiers had allegedly preyed on local women, attacking them while they were fetching firewood, water, or grazing livestock. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It recounted a horrific 1997 incident in Archer's Post where \"30 women were gang-raped at knife-point\", some inside their own homes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Batuk said it had \"zero tolerance for sexual exploitation and abuse\" and took any such allegations very seriously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witnesses also described instances of public indecency by soldiers, including exposing themselves in social venues and town centres, often involving intoxication, disorderly behaviour, and in some cases, violent or sexually aggressive conduct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides rape and assault, the inquiry also documented cases of abandoned \"fatherless\" children. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Dozens of children have been fathered by British soldiers who returned home, leaving behind single mothers facing stigma and financial hardship,\" it stated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The MPs also alleged that Batuk has never carried out the legally required environmental and social impact assessments for its field exercises, and raised concerns over the possible use of white phosphorus, which they described as \"notorious for the severity of the injuries it causes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Residents reported respiratory issues, miscarriages, and livestock deaths due to toxic fumes and leftover military waste.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one case, a ranger reportedly died after taking home unexploded ordnance from a Batuk range, while a child is said to have lost both arms and an eye after encountering another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its defence, Batuk said that independent environmental audits showed high levels of compliance with Kenyan regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigating panel said Batuk had \"persistently\" declined to appear before the committee and instead \"invoked claims of diplomatic immunity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The British defence ministry said it had responded to the issues highlighted during the inquiry and \"outlined the actions taken to address the concerns raised\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, the UK High Commission said it was prepared to investigate \"where new allegations have come to light in the committee's report\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We deeply regret the challenges which have arisen in relation to our defence presence in Kenya,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the parliamentary panel found the existing defence cooperation agreement between Kenya and the UK was \"structurally flawed\", saying the legal instrument has huge gaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It noted that \"the offence of murder, despite its gravity, is not explicitly listed… as an offence deemed outside the course of official duty\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, it argued, created a \"significant obstacle to justice,\" adding that the existing oversight mechanism was largely ineffective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee recommended the military agreement be amended to introduce a visiting forces code of conduct, zero-tolerance rules for gender-based violence, environmental obligations, and civilian oversight. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also called on the Kenyan defence ministry to negotiate with the UK government on mechanisms to hold Batuk soldiers accountable for child support.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2

At least, not right now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But cars need fuel (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?</p></div></div></body></html>"

On Tuesday they claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.

When I ask whether that means giving up her home for good, she replies, \"in this situation, yes\". They're already making plans to rebuild their lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some soldiers sent to the Donbas are also voting with their feet. There have been nearly 300,000 cases of desertion, or soldiers going  absent without official leave, since the start of Russia's full scale invasion - and numbers have risen dramatically over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them is Serhii - not his real name. We met him in hiding. His home has become his prison as he tries to evade arrest. Serhii volunteered to fight at the start of the year, whereas most of the men in his unit were forcibly mobilised - \"taken off the street\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says his unit was already below strength when it was sent to the front, near Pokrovsk, and they weren't properly trained or equipped. \"I ended up in a battalion where everything was a mess,\" he says, although he still believes this was the exception, not the norm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii deserted in May after two of his friends went awol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't have gone if we had proper leadership and someone experienced in charge,\" he says. \"I came to serve, not to run\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii is still thinking about his next move, and the possibility of returning to the army.

The West African country has experienced at least nine attempted and successful coups since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when military officers announced they had seized control of the country last Wednesday, some analysts and political figures were sceptical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All the typical ingredients for a coup were there: gunfire was heard near the presidential palace, the President - Umaro Sissoco Embaló - was arrested and soldiers gave an address on state television.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, other circumstances have been called into question, with Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan joining a chorus of voices who believe the takeover was masterminded by Embaló himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And to complicate matters further, the military insisted to the BBC that it had taken over the country, but condemned the use of the word \"coup\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The junta leaders said they were acting to thwart a plot by unnamed politicians who had \"the support of a well-known drug baron\" to destabilise the country, which has become known as a drug-trafficking hub.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the lead-up to the coup?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just three days before the military takeover, Bissau-Guineans voted in a presidential election.

It is now almost three months after her release from captivity in Iraq, where she was held for 903 days. The first four and a half months had been particularly brutal: she was, she says, trussed and hung from the ceiling, whipped, sexually abused, electrocuted.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March 2023, Ms Tsurkov, a 39-year-old doctoral student at Princeton University in the US, was living in Baghdad, conducting fieldwork for her PhD in comparative politics. She agreed to meet a woman who described herself as a friend of a friend. The woman never showed up. Ms Tsurkov started walking home. She says that a car pulled up behind her and two men dragged her in, beating and sexually assaulting her. She was driven to the outskirts of the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During the first month, they starved me and interrogated me, but at the time they didn't know about my Israeli citizenship.

But then the kidnappers accessed her phone, and \"because I'm not a spy and don't have multiple encrypted devices, everything showed that I'm Israeli\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says that was when the torture started: electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and what she calls Middle Eastern \"specialities\". \"Being hung from the ceiling with hands cuffed behind my back. Being hung with the hands above my head.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And \"a particular method that is used in Iraq. It's called 'the scorpion'.

These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters File photo showing a mourner carrying a Kataib Hezbollah flag during a funeral in Baghdad, Iraq, for a commander of the Iraqi militia who was killed in an Israeli strike in Syria (22 September 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution. Toxic metals that can cause kidney damage and cancers, as well as gastric and intestinal issues, could be carried downstream to the capital, Lusaka, says Dr Mweene Himwiinga, a senior lecturer at Zambia's Copperbelt University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in Lusaka disputes the scale of the damage and told the BBC it welcomed the establishment of an independent investigation into the incident. The Zambian government, it said, had reported that the pollution was contained to a confined area, water acidity levels had returned to normal limits and that ongoing checks showed no lasting public-health risks.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1bb5/live/a190ad90-c61d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Associated Press Aerial showing path of tailings dam having breached into the environment.

The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All eyes are on this case,\" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People found it hard to believe at first \"because something of this scale had not happened before,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,\" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. \"We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ali Ngwane / BBC A portrait of Abigail Namtowe, 28, a farmer in Twalima village.

These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,\" says Prof Chan. \"The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African governments are \"not always getting it right\", he says, however \"this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was \"grossly unfair\" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,\" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ed-habershon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ed Habershon</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251127-095948-54e3bea482-web-2.35.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man in white clerical garb talks to a man in a black business coat. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ghaith-solh\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ghaith Solh</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
