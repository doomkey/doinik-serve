Police were also seen using tear gas in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian government said it \"recognises the protests\" and would listen \"with patience, even if it is confronted with harsh voices\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X late on Monday that he had instructed the interior minister to hold talks with what he described as \"representatives\" of the protesters so that measures could be taken \"to resolve the problems and act responsibly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also accepted the resignation of Iran's central bank governor, Mohammadreza Farzin, and named former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati to replace him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">University students have also joined the protests, chanting anti-government slogans including \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who holds ultimate power in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some protesters were also heard chanting slogans in support of the son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, including \"Long live the Shah\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Reza Pahlavi, who lives in exile in the United States, wrote on X: \"I am with you. Victory is ours because our cause is just and because we are united.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as this regime remains in power, the country's economic situation will continue to deteriorate,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US state department's Persian-language account on X also expressed support for the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the US \"praises their courage\" and stands with those seeking \"dignity and a better future\" after years of failed policies and economic mismanagement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran was reportedly high on the agenda of a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday,</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a joint news conference afterwards, Trump declined to say whether he supported regime change in Iran, but said: \"They've got a lot of problems: tremendous inflation, their economy is bust, their economy is no good, and I know people aren't so happy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president also said he might back another round of Israeli air strikes on Iran if the country rebuilt its ballistic missile or nuclear programmes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a 12-day war between Israel and Iran in June, the US carried out air strikes on key Iranian uranium enrichment sites. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Pezeshkian vowed on Tuesday that Iran's response to \"any oppressive act of aggression\" would be \"severe and regret-inducing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's supreme leader has repeatedly said that Israel's government hoped mass protests would erupt in Iran during the war and topple the regime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They wanted to create sedition on the streets...

But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power goes - by implication to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Washington Post via Getty Images A man wheels a barrow towards a dumpster on a road that is overlooked by the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on the Russian controlled southern bank side of the Dnipro river\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Washington Post via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other sticking points that could derail deal</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU. Few believe it will happen very soon.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could Ukrainians hold a vote on a deal?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian leader has cited opinion polls that suggest 87% of Ukrainians want peace, while at the same time 85% reject withdrawing from Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he believes no decision on either the fate of Donetsk or the broader 20-point plan can be made without a popular vote and a 60-day ceasefire to prepare it: \"A referendum is the way to accept it or not accept it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This too is a potential sticking point as the Kremlin argues a temporary ceasefire would only prolong the conflict and lead to renewed hostilities - and Trump has said he understands Putin's position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But without such a vote Zelensky believes a deal would have no validity which just adds to the list of thorny issues to be resolved.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded. But it can indicate how the intensity of fighting is changing over time.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">2025 starts with a relatively low number of published obituaries in January, compared with the previous months. Then the number rises in February, when  Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mukashev (inset) signed up for the army after he was given a 10-year jail term</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022. Then, in early 2024, Mukashev was detained near his home in Moscow and charged with large-scale drug dealing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While his case was being tried he was offered a contract with the defence ministry, according to his friends and family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They saw the heavy charges levelled against him as a typical ploy to get people to sign up.

A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are differing types of national tribute in France. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42291491\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday</a>, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why not?

When he was killed in a military coup in 1981, Zia entered politics and went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Known as an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to take part in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, Zia broke through a male-dominated political landscape and transformed into one of Bangladesh's most formidable political leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her first term was widely praised for efforts to improve women's education and social development, with her government bringing back parliamentary democracy by amending the constitution with bipartisan support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her second term in 1996, which lasted only weeks, drew criticism for staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority — a measure parliament approved before dissolving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia returned as prime minister in 2001, stepping down in October 2006 ahead of a general election. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past 16 years, under the Awami League government, Zia became the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She boycotted the 2014 election after her rival Hasina scrapped the caretaker government system — a provision meant to ensure neutrality during national polls. Later, Zia was convicted on corruption charges and jailed. She denied wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was released in January 2025, soon after mass anti-government protests in Bangladesh toppled Hasina, forcing her into exile in India. She has since been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">convicted and sentenced to death</a> for crimes against humanity over her crackdown of the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BNP had said in November that Zia would campaign in the upcoming general elections. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia had been in hospital for the past month, receiving treatment for kidney damage, heart disease and pneumonia, among other conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being kept away from public life due to her health, Zia remained a figurehead for opposition forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus had called for the country to pray for Zia, calling her a \"source of utmost inspiration for the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Tuesday, Yunus offered his condolences for the passing of Zia, whom he described as a \"symbol of the democratic<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The nation has lost a great guardian... Her role in the struggle to establish democracy, a multi-party political culture, and the rights of the people in Bangladesh will be remembered forever,\" he said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina's party, the Awami League, now banned in Bangladesh, issued a statement from Hasina on X paying tribute to Zia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina, who is still in India, said in her statement that Zia's \"contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered\", and her passing was a \"profound loss for Bangladesh's political life\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is \"deeply saddened\" by Zia's passing and paid tribute to her contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, and its relations with India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,\" he wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia \"a committed friend of Pakistan\", whose service to Bangladesh would leave a lasting legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia's family members, including Rahman, his wife and his daughter, were by her side in her last moments, BNP said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,\" the party said in its statement on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-fan-wang\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Fan Wang</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

I certainly have seen it,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, nothing worries me. They've been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area,\" he said of the drills, which have ramped up in recent years and now include simulating a blockade of the island. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The drills, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87l7xjp235o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">which began on Monday,</a> take place nearly two weeks after the US announced <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7095g45p1po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">one of its largest-ever arms sales</a> to Taiwan. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The drills are<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>a warning against \"Taiwan independence separatist forces\" and \"external interference\", the Chinese military said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include 10 hours of live-firing exercises in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command in charge of the Taiwan Strait said it has lined up destroyers, frigates and fighter-bombers to test \"sea-air coordination\" and \"integrated containment capabilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected 130 Chinese military aircraft around the island on Tuesday morning, 90 of which crossed the \"median line\" - an unofficial border dividing China and Taiwan, the validity of which China rejects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such incursions, however, have been happening even when there are no drills, as Beijing practises so-called <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">grey-zone warfare tactics</a> aimed at weakening Taiwan's defences over a prolonged period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taiwanese ministry said on Tuesday that it had spotted more than a dozen Chinese navy vessels near the island. Taiwan's armed forces monitored the situation and have deployed aircraft, ships and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a Tuesday morning statement on social media, President Lai Ching-te said the Chinese Communist Party's escalation of military pressure was \"not something that a responsible power should do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will act responsibly and not escalate conflict or stir up disputes,\" he said, adding that Taiwan's military and national security team would \"do their best to ensure the safety of the country\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"main audience\" for this week's drills \"really is the United States, Donald Trump and Japan more than the people of Taiwan,\" Susan Shirk, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the BBC's Newsday programme. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's an expression of resolve and anger\" about the US arm sales, which now include not only defensive weapons but also offensive equipment that could strike the Chinese mainland, Ms Shirk added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also pointed out concerns in the US that President Trump \"is less committed to America's defence of Taiwan than previous presidents had been\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's engaged in a kind of transactional policy in which he might be willing to reduce some of America's commitment to Taiwan, in exchange for other trade or economic benefits,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alexander Neill, an adjunct fellow with the Pacific Forum, told the BBC that the ongoing exercise is \"designed to demonstrate an operational capability by the People's Liberation Army at sea and in the air\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is \"not wrong\" about China's ramping of up such exercises over the past two decades, which is in line with the modernisation of its military, Mr Neill says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he adds, \"if [Trump] is suggesting that his rapport with Xi Jinping will have any bearing on Xi's approach to the Taiwan Strait, I think he's deluding himself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to take it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has in recent years <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">ramped up pressure</a> over Taipei with military drills and regular incursions into its waters and airspace. Taiwan in turn has plans to boost defence spending to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwnwep9qeo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">modernise its armed forces</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Trump has downplayed Beijing's ongoing drills, his administration had recently announced a $11bn (£8.2bn) weapons package to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan and the island's biggest arms supplier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China hit back at the sale with sanctions on several US defence firms. Its foreign ministry also said that any attempt to \"contain China by using Taiwan will absolutely not succeed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that China must \"firmly counter\" what he described as \"continuous provocations from pro-independence forces in Taiwan\" and the \"large-scale arms sales\" from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the \"complete national reunification\" of Taiwan was \"a historical mission we must accomplish\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Venezuela's government is yet to respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The explosion was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously threatened land strikes in Venezuela, as well as authorising covert CIA action, as part of a pressure campaign on President Nicolás Maduro.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been no official comment on Trump's remarks from Venezuela and - while there has been speculation on social media - there are no reports of any strikes in Venezuelan state-run media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reporters asked Trump on Monday if the CIA had carried out the attack, and he said: \"I don't want to say that. I know exactly who it was, but I don't want to say who it was.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the second time Trump has mentioned the explosion. In a radio interview last week, he described a US operation against a \"big facility\", but provided limited details. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US strike on land would constitute a marked escalation in the pressure the Trump administration has put on Maduro, whom the US has accused of leading a \"narco-terrorist\" organisation - an accusation the Venezuelan president has denied.  </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since September, the US has launched 30 strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats, targeting vessels in the Pacific and the Caribbean, and killing more than 100 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent strike was on Monday, with US Southern Command saying in a social media post that two \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in a \"lethal kinetic strike\" in the eastern Pacific. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US has provided no evidence to back up its allegations that the boats it struck were carrying drugs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the exception of two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorean national - none of the identities of those on board have been made public. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, Trump provided little detail about the alleged strike on land, but seemed to signal that a new phase in the pressure campaign on Venezuela had been reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area.

But $2 billion is just a fraction of what the US has traditionally spent on aid. In 2022 its contribution to the UN's humanitarian work was estimated at $17 billion (£12.6bn).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the funding comes with some strings attached. Although UN donors do sometimes earmark specific projects, the UN funding prioritises just 17 countries, among them Haiti, Syria, and Sudan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Afghanistan and Yemen will not, Mr Lewin said, receive any money, adding that Washington had evidence that in Afghanistan UN funds were being diverted to the Taliban and that \"President Trump will never tolerate a penny of taxpayers' money going to terrorist groups\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such restrictions will be hard for aid agencies working in countries not on the list. The impact of funding cuts has already led to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Afghanistan, and reductions in food rations for displaced people in Sudan. Globally, child mortality, which has been declining, is set to rise this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conditions placed on the new US funding also rule out spending money on projects related to tackling climate change, which Mr Lewin said were not \"life saving\", and not in \"the US interest\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lewin, a Trump loyalist who reportedly masterminded the shutdown of USAID and the firing of its thousands of staff, warned the UN that it must \"adapt or die\", saying that the US \"piggy bank is not open to those organisations that just want to return to the old system\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US says funding must be focused and efficient, with no duplication among aid projects. These are qualities Tom Fletcher, and the entire UN system, say they wholeheartedly support. It's in no-one's interests, least of all those of the estimated 200 million people caught up in crises, for money to be spent unwisely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while the UN is gratefully welcoming the new US funding, there remain big questions about whether the conditions around it are too politicised. The fundamental principles of humanitarian aid are that it should be neutral, impartial, and directed at those most in need. Eliminating specific countries, or specific crises such as climate change, challenges those principles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, as it struggles with a continued funding crises, and, in Washington, a very skeptical donor, many in the UN will be acknowledging that $2 billion is better than nothing.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The government in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu, has repeatedly said that any recognition of Somaliland's independence would contravene Somalia's sovereignty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has also characterised Israel's declaration as an \"existential threat\" to his country's unity.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why did Israel recognise Somaliland as an independent state?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a phone call with Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi on Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country was acknowledging Somaliland's \"right of self-determination\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said official recognition would be \"a great opportunity for expanding\" the countries' partnership. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has pledged to cooperate with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However analysts say there are strategic reasons for Israel's declaration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Israel requires allies in the Red Sea region for many strategic reasons, among them the possibility of a future campaign against the Houthis,\" Israeli think tank the Institute for National Security Studies said, referring to Yemen's Iran-backed rebels, in a paper last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Somaliland is an ideal candidate for such cooperation as it could offer Israel potential access to an operational area close to the conflict zone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel repeatedly struck targets in Yemen after the Gaza war broke out in October 2023, in response to Houthi attacks on Israel that the rebels said were in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to Israel recognising Somaliland, the Houthis warned that any Israeli presence in Somaliland would be considered a \"military target\" for their forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few months ago, a number of news outlets reported that Israel had contacted Somaliland over the potential resettlement of Palestinians forcibly removed from Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel did not comment on the reports, but at the time, Somaliland said that any move by Israel to recognise its independence would not have anything to do with the Palestinian issue. Both Somalia and the Palestinian Authority have suggested Israel's recognition of Somaliland could be linked to a plan to displace Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Somalia will never accept the people of Palestine to be forcibly evicted from their rightful land to a faraway place,\" Somalia's president told his parliament on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Offering his perspective, US-based Africa analyst Cameron Hudson told the BBC that Israel has recognised Somaliland primarily because it is trying to counter Iran's influence in the Red Sea region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Red Sea is also a conduit for weapons and fighters to flow up the Red Sea into the Eastern Mediterranean. It has traditionally been a source of support and supply to fighters in Gaza. And so having a presence, having a security presence, having an intelligence presence at the mouth of the Red Sea only serves Israel's national security interests,\" he said.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why has Israel's move been condemned so widely? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has been criticised by the likes of Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, the African Union, Yemen, Sudan, Nigeria, Libya, Iran, Iraq and Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their condemnations, many of these countries have referred to Somalia's \"territorial integrity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The African Union has long been concerned that recognising Somaliland could set off a chain reaction, where separatists could demand recognition for the territories they claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Regions could attempt to establish external alliances without the consent of central governments, creating a dangerous precedent that risks widespread instability,\" Abdurahman Sayed, a UK-based analyst for the Horn of Africa, told the BBC.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could more countries support Somaliland's independence?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Countries considered to be allies of Somaliland, or sympathetic to its campaign for recognition, have largely remained quiet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For instance, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which operates a military port in Somaliland, has not released a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hudson told the BBC that the UAE is \"very much aligned with the Israelis on this question of Somaliland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think even now today you're going to see an alignment of Israeli and Emirati interests across the entire Red Sea region,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ethiopia's government has also refrained from commenting. Last year <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67911057\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Somaliland agreed to lease part of its coastline to landlocked Ethiopia </a>- a move that angered Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Abdurahman said Turkey stepped in to mediate between Somalia and Ethiopia. It led Ethiopia to sign an agreement with Somalia's government, committing to respect its territorial integrity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a result, although Israel's unilateral recognition of Somaliland may be quietly welcomed by Ethiopia, Addis Ababa appears to have adopted a cautious 'wait-and-see' approach,\" the analyst added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somalilanders had hoped the US would recognise it as an independent state following signals given before Donald Trump began his second term as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in response to Israel's declaration, Trump suggested to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/12/26/us-news/trump-not-ready-to-embrace-somaliland-independence-unlike-netanyahu/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">New York Post</a> that he would not swiftly follow Netanyahu's lead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?,\" he reportedly said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union and the UK have also refused to recognise Somaliland's independence, saying they support Somalia's territorial integrity.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More BBC stories on Somaliland:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Syria's interim government \"hasn't any experience to deal with the situation\", he tells me. \"Some ask us to give them a chance, but one year has passed and the indications are not good.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He too has visited the new Syria, and, like Aya, was not reassured. \"The security situation is very bad,\" he says. \"Every day there are killings. Regardless of who the victims are, they have souls.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His voice softens when he speaks of his 80-year-old father in Damascus, who hasn't seen his grandsons for 12 years, and may never see them again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, he and his family can remain in Turkey, but he's already making contingency plans in case government policy changes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Plan A is that we will stay here in Turkey,\" he says. \"If we cannot, I'm thinking about plan B, C and even D. I am an engineer, always planning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of those plans involve a return to Syria.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If going home is hard, staying in Turkey isn't easy either.  Syrians have \"temporary protection\" that comes with restrictions. They are not supposed to leave the cities where they are first registered.  Work permits are hard to get, and many are in low paid jobs, living on the margins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who backed the uprising against Assad - has insisted that no Syrian will be driven out, but refugee advocates say there are growing pressures beneath the surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They point to the ending of free medical care for Syrians from January, and new government regulations which make it more expensive to hire them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These new elements cast a shadow over how voluntary returns are,\" says Metin Corabatir, who heads an independent Turkish research centre on asylum and migration, IGAM.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he says presidential and parliamentary elections – due by 2028 – may be another threat for Syrians here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Normally President Erdogan is their main protector,\" Mr Corabatir tells me. \"He says they can stay as long as they want. And he repeated this after the regime changed. But if there is an election, and a political gain for the AKP [ruling party] to make, there might be some policy changes.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Syrian refugees residing in Turkey return to their homeland through the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay on 11 December 2024.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">More than half a million Syrians have left Turkey since the ousting of Assad</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections could revive the xenophobic rhetoric that featured in the last polls, he warns. \"Those feelings went to sleep,\" he says, \"but I am quite sure the infrastructure of this xenophobic attitude is still alive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold grey morning at a border crossing an hour's drive from Gaziantep the hills of Syria are visible, a short distance away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmud Sattouf and his wife Suad Helal are heading to their homeland – this time just for a visit.

target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/alaa-abd-el-fattah-egypt-activist-citizenship-lsn35tqhr?t=1766958039719\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Times reports some senior Labour MPs are also calling for his citizenship</a> to be removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After reviewing the historic posts, Mr Abd El Fattah said: \"I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Abd El Fattah said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Mr Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after he was freed from prison in Egypt, but it is understood he was unaware of the historical messages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister's official spokesman said: \"We welcome the return of a British citizen unfairly detained abroad, as we would in all cases and as we have done in the past.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the government has \"condemned the nature of these historic tweets, and we consider them to be abhorrent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is understood that the Foreign Office has started an internal review into how the case has been handled by successive governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage both said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood should look at whether Mr Abd El Fattah's citizenship could be revoked to enable his swift removal from the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farage said in a letter to Mahmood: \"It should go without saying that anyone who possesses racist and anti-British views such as those of [Mr Abd El Fattah] should not be allowed into the UK.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government source said Mr Abd El Fatteh arrived in the country as a British citizen and there were no legal avenues available to block his entry, even if officials had been aware of his previous social media posts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2016 Supreme Court case found that nationality law was incompatible with human rights safeguards because it discriminated against children from mixed unmarried backgrounds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result, in 2019 the then-Conservative government used a 15-minute debate in Parliament to end a requirement for children of one British parent to show they were of \"good character\", before they could be given nationality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That political decision, backed by the Labour opposition, paved the way for Mr Abd El Fatteh and others like him to be later registered as British because his mother had been born in London .</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is understood that Downing Street believes there is a high bar to someone having their citizenship revoked because they must have either obtained citizenship by fraud or be deemed to pose a significant national security threat - a test unlikely to be met in this case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any decision of this nature would also be subject to legal challenge.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Abd El Fattah's release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was granted citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother - when the Conservatives were in power and Dame Priti Patel was home secretary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shadow home secretary Chris Philp - who was an immigration minister under Patel but left the role in September 2021 before citizenship was granted - told the BBC he did not know of these details at the time. He added he was now clear in his mind that \"this man should have his citizenship revoked\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PA Media Shadow home secretary Chris Philp wears a blue suit and tie.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">PA Media</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he says he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no excuse for that kind of language,\" Philp said on Monday. \"People who express that kind of hatred, that kind of anti-white racism, that kind of extremism who seek to incite violence, have no place in the United Kingdom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing on the same programme, Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she told Today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it so he is a British citizen.

It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.</p></div><figure><div

of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Overcoming fear and establishing control</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'We were dehumanised'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"VCG via Getty Images A Rwandan girl sitting on a roadside with some luggage \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">VCG via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mirrorpix/Getty Images A group of people going about their days in Rwanda following the civil war\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Liaison/ Getty Images A child dries her face June 24, 1994 at the Nyarushishi Tutsi refugee camp on the Zaire border in Gisenyi, Rwanda\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Liaison/ Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Global conflicts that have affected millions of children -

Her father had died before the slaughter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Creating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-harriet-whitehead\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Harriet Whitehead</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credit:-epa/shutterstock\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credit: EPA/Shutterstock</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

In fact, the versatile naan diligently props up whatever it is paired with, allowing the main dish to shine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's probably why this flatbread has become one of the most popular breads in the world. Recently, butter garlic naan - a flavour-packed rendition of the traditional naan - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tasteatlas.com/breads\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">topped Taste Atlas' best breads list</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is made by brushing butter onto a piping hot naan and sprinkling a generous amount of chopped garlic on it. Also on the list was aloo naan - made by stuffing the naan with potatoes seasoned with spices and coriander.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While today naans and its versions have become ubiquitous in restaurants serving Indian or Middle Eastern fare, they were once served only in the courts of Islamic kings.

The Persians used water and flour to make the bread, which was most-likely baked on hot pebbles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The naan travelled to the Indian subcontinent with the Sultans who ruled large parts of the subcontinent between the 13th and 16th Centuries. The Muslim rulers brought with them culinary traditions that spoke of their Western and Central Asian roots, which included using a tandoor (clay oven) to cook food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amir Khusrau, an Indo-Persian poet who documented courtly life during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://scroll.in/magazine/1056231/in-the-poetry-of-amir-khusrau-food-is-served-with-style-and-flourish\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mentioned two types of naans</a> in his writings - naan-e-tanuk and naan-i-tanuri. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the former was delicate and thin, the latter was a thick, puffy flatbread baked in a tandoor. During the Delhi Sultanate, naans were usually enjoyed with different meat preparations, like kebabs (meat grilled on skewers over charcoal) and keema (minced meat).</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Two naan breads topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, grated cheese, basil, mushrooms and what looks like it could be chicken strips\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pizza naan uses the flatbread as a base</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooks in the royal kitchens also advanced the art of naan-making by introducing specialised kneading techniques and adding yeast - a rare ingredient at the time - to make the bread softer and fluffier. Because of its complex and expensive preparation, the naan became a luxury food item enjoyed largely by the nobility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This remained the norm during the reign of subsequent Mughal emperors as well, which stretched over the next three centuries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Specialised cooks, called naan bais, made and experimented with the flatbread, using adjectives to highlight their innovations.

Back in India, the naan weaved its way into colonial cuisine, as it began being paired with cured meats or sauces infused with local spices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But over time, complex preparations gave way to simpler techniques and a more basic preparation of the naan became accessible to the common man, like the variety we see in most local restaurants today,\" says Ms Vermani.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, naan is made by combing flour, yogurt and yeast and kneading them into a soft dough. The dough is left to rise before being divided into balls and patted into shape by hand. The naan is then placed in a very hot tandoor until it puffs up and brown spots appear. It is lightly brushed with butter or ghee before serving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the story of the naan doesn't end here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 1990s and 2000s, the naan saw a fresh wave of innovations as fine dining restaurants in India and abroad began experimenting with the flatbread. Chef Suvir Saran recollects how his restaurant in New York began infusing naan with spinach, gouda and mushrooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a way to jazz up the naan to make it more appealing for non-Indians, while Indians could feel less guilty about eating their traditional food abroad,\" Mr Saran says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The Cleveland Museum of Art, Andrew R. and Martha Holden Jennings Fund 1971 Opium Smokers Served Fruit and Bread, circa 1750, gum tempera and gold on paper\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">The Cleveland Museum of Art, Andrew R. and Martha Holden Jennings Fund 1971</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A 1750 painting showing people enjoying naan and smoking opium</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend spread like wildfire and today, restaurants across the world are serving experimental naans stuffed and sprinkled with a variety of food items. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You'll find a restaurant in Goa serving a pork vindaloo naan or a butter chicken naan, while there's one in Hong Kong that serves a truffle cheese naan,\" Mr Saran says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The naan is India's glorious culinary gift to the world,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Food historians may not fully agree - naan belongs to other South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines as well - but its ties to India are deep and long-standing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Saran says that the naan offers a message on belonging and the Indian identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The naan tells a story of plurality; of cross-cultural identities co-existing in harmony,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It shows us that differences need not cancel out each other when they can be celebrated together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this.

But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool  (L-R) Russia's President Vladimir Putin walks with China's President Xi Jinping and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance.  I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">John Simpson has reported on China many times over the years - pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Altogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish.  It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the process has already started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credits:-afp-/-getty-images\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credits: AFP / Getty Images</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Much of the terrain can only be reached using vehicles capable of navigating rough desert paths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Nukuru, the villagers' main means of transport appeared to be donkeys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said that by day the Lakurawa militants come into the community - having established themselves as the de facto governing authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The farmers and villagers have no option but to agree to their terms and taxes as the Islamists are well-armed.

Behind us, the vast metropolis of Beijing has yet to wake. As we wait, we hear only our own breath.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And then, as the sky starts to lighten ahead of sunrise, we hear footsteps.

We eventually follow with our cameras.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Slowly, we tread through a line of trees, into a small clearing. We only spot the bird net when it is a few inches from our faces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Each year, tens of thousands of birds are caught in nets across China for the pet trade, or for meat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pandemic and a property crisis have turned the economy sluggish - so catching and selling songbirds on the black market is a low-cost and often low-risk way of making a large profit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A pretty songbird, such as a Siberian rubythroat, can often sell for nearly 2,000 yuan (£210; $280), which is more than many farmers earn in a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I want to protect them on this Earth controlled by humans,\" Silva says.

And in my dreams, I'm always flying.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trapped</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the skies above us, billions of birds, many so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand, are migrating south for winter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have taken advantage of the long summer days in Siberia, or Mongolia, feasting on bugs and berries. As the year comes to a close and icy winds bring the first frosts of winter, they are flying to warmer places to nest and feed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was back in October, when flying through China is the equivalent of rush hour for migratory birds heading to Australia, New Zealand or southern Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is home to 1500-plus bird species, which is about 13% of the global population - more than 800 of those are migratory birds. Four of the nine major routes they follow intersect in China. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are long, often perilous journeys, where the birds navigate through storms and evade predators, while looking for the ideal spot to spend the night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The patch of grassland where we were, on the outskirts of the Chinese capital, is an oasis for small birds - any further and the city skies offer few options to rest among towering rows of concrete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also an oasis for the poachers and their \"mist nets\", so thin you can barely see them. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch the moment BBC stumbles upon bird poachers in Beijing</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one we nearly walked into was stretched across half the length of the field and propped up with bamboo poles. In the middle, a small finch was desperately trying to free his legs, but the more it moved, the more its claws became tangled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a meadow pipit, a protected bird in China, and an important \"indicator species\" - that means if its numbers are thriving, so is its environment.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The poacher spotted us and started to run. From a small pouch on his hip, he threw around half a dozen small birds into the air before sprinting deeper into the shrubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our cameras caught the moment he was stopped by Silva whose years of experience have taught him how to detain poachers while he calls the police. He stops the poacher from leaving, simply by continuing to block his path.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the beginning I had no experience and at that time I was quite afraid,\" he later says. \"But if you really want to do something, those fears will all be forgotten.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police arrived about 40 minutes later to arrest the poacher.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Hunting the hunters </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva, who in his 30s, does this work for free using his own savings. He has given up on many nights of sleep to set songbirds free, and he has spent the last 10 years persuading the police in Beijing to take this crime seriously. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Back in 2015, no-one cared,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he recruited volunteers who did care and launched a group called the Beijing Migratory Bird Squad. He held public meetings and invited the heads of the local police and forestry bureau. These small and persistent acts of persuasion appear to have worked. The police discovered that catching poachers also led to tracking down other kinds of criminal activity in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We found our goals were partially aligned,\" Silva says, adding the caveat that enforcement is still patchy. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Silva Gu has spent the last decade fighting to protect and free rare songbirds</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva's love of birds started in childhood. He grew up in the 1990s in a very different Beijing - grand and imposing, but not the capital of an economic giant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He remembers roaming through the grasslands on the city's edges where he found birds, frogs and snakes. \"But starting from the 2000s, everything changed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's booming economy brought millions of rural workers to cities as they sought jobs in factories or in construction. This rapid urbanisation meant grasslands were seen as empty places to build,<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>not sanctuaries<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>to conserve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The change stunned Silva. The grasslands began to shrink, as did the habitats they supported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I decided back then to work in conservation and I took this path,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Silva chasing the poacher in the grassland outside Beijing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has not been an easy life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of Beijing's biggest bird dealers found out he was being investigated by Silva and retaliated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He gathered several of his accomplices who surrounded me and beat me up,\" Silva recalls. He says he went to the police but those responsible were not brought to justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also lost his army of volunteers over the years. This work requires stealth and sleepless nights to stalk poachers in the dark. Silva says few people are willing to take on the difficult - and sometimes dangerous - job. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do this full-time,\" he says. \"I made it a project because if you want to solve this big problem, you must devote yourself wholeheartedly. You can't do it part-time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says fundraising pays for some of the costs - more than 100,000 yuan, $14,000 a year - but donations have dipped because of the slowing economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he has found new ways to hunt the hunters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He studies satellite imagery to find the paths worn away by the poachers through large fields and grasslands. He maps those against the bird's migratory routes and looks for areas where they may stop for the night. The satellite images can even show lines of net traps which can catch hundreds of small birds at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's what the mist nets do. They trap a variety of small birds even if the poachers are after prized versions, like the Siberian rubythroat.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Catching and selling protected songbirds is a profitable business in China</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Siberian rubythroats and bluethroats sell for a high price,\" Silva says. \"In big cities like Beijing and Tianjin, those who want to keep birds are now quite wealthy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although there are wildlife laws in place, Silva reckons the fines to punish the crime do not outweigh the financial benefits of catching and selling songbirds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owning a pet bird was - and for some generations in China, still is - a status symbol. This dates back to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from the mid-17th to early 20th Century. Nobles and elites would build ornate bamboo cages for their birds to display their elegance and wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a tradition that continues mainly among retired men in their 60s or 70s. Silva says older Chinese people don't realise they are committing a wildlife crime, or understand that so many more birds had to die in a trap so they could buy a caged bird.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This generation didn't even have enough to eat growing up. Now with a little money, they have inherited the habit and custom of caging birds,\" he says. \"China developed so fast, there was no time to educate people about ecology and once adults values are formed, they're really hard to change. Maybe they can't be changed in a lifetime.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva feels alone in this fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sometimes, I am so tired. I want to find someone, maybe a group of people and we could combine our strength - but right now there is no-one.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Busted</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a long low wall alongside the Liangshui river in Beijing, a trader has several small cages with tiny twittering birds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another man stands outside the nearby vegetable market holding a bird cage shrouded in a black veil. He tells passers-by quietly that his songbird is rare, worth nearly 1900 yuan, or about $270.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a glimpse of an old Beijing where small unofficial traders have created their own market. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">An old-school market in Beijing, selling everything from crickets to caged birds</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The path by the river stretches for several miles and on a sunny weekday morning, there were shoppers browsing everything from vintage jewellery to false teeth, all laid out at makeshift stalls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We were told we would be able to buy a wild songbird in a small park just off the path. It was easy to find. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music was blasting from a speaker under the low trees where a troop of elderly ladies were choreographing a fan dance routine. Nearby several men, all over 50, had gathered with bird cages - some had two or three in their hands. Most were covered in dark cloth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But today there would be no sales because the police had arrived. They were questioning the bird owners and taking names. Defiant, one man said he was taking his caged bird for a walk. This does happen in many Beijing parks, where songbird owners gather with their caged pets to chat and compare notes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This police visit was part of a wider campaign by the Ministry of Public Security that was announced earlier in the year.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Qu Mingbin via Getty Images A Siberian Rubythroat stands on a branch in the Jfo Mountain National Nature Reserve in Chongqing, China, on Oct. 10, 2021.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Qu Mingbin via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A Siberian rubythroat can fetch more than $250 on the black market</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wildlife trade is big business. Interpol estimates the illegal portion of the trade to be worth nearly $20bn and, according to Animal Survival group, China is the largest consumer of wildlife products, both illegal and legal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials in Beijing have repeatedly denied accusations that the Covid-19 pandemic originated through animal-to-human transmission at a wet market in Wuhan, where wildlife was also being sold. Conservation groups have been pressuring the Chinese government to ban trade in wildlife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year, Chinese state media described the protection of wild birds as crucial for safeguarding ecosystems vital to human survival. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This shift in authorities' attitudes is also why Silva has had success working with the police.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">It's mostly older men who still keep caged birds - in the cage is a Chinese bulbul, also a songbird</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in the field outside Beijing, Silva managed to keep the poacher at arm's length until the police arrived. The man appeared to be in his 50s and was wearing old construction overalls. Don't move, Silva warned him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The poacher offerered to kneel and apologise, telling Silva that he only came to the field to look at birds. But Silva grabbed his phone, where he found photos and videos of dozens of caged birds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, when Silva and the police searched his home, they found them all still there, waiting to be sold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the wildlife poaching rings in China are much bigger. In Dalian earlier this year, the police arrested 13 suspects, and seized more than 12,000 yellow-breasted buntings, a wild bird with the highest protection level in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva worries that despite the renewed efforts to catch poachers, they face few penalties. But he is also encouraged. He has rescued more than 20,000 birds on site for the past 10 years and disrupted the nets of countless poachers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there's hope,\" he says, pinning his on a generational change - when more young people will understand and appreciate China's rare songbirds and the need to protect them.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until then, he says, he will keep at it himself: \"This is my ideal. If you have this ideal, you must persist. You can't not.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so each night during the annual migration, he will patrol the fields of Beijing in the hope that he can bring back the dulcet tones of songbirds to the city's skies -  he wants his city to sound like it did in his childhood.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Some of these were leaked to the public before the trial – it is not clear who released them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one particularly disturbing recording, Diiriye can be heard saying: \"I'm enjoying your pain.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A post-mortem examination of Saabirin's body revealed multiple injuries and deep stab wounds consistent with prolonged violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As details of the police investigation emerged, public anger grew.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Abdiqaadir Washington A tarmac road is in the foreground strewn with wooden sticks and stones as a result of a protest.

Some kind of compensation is usually agreed but as this process prioritises peace over justice for the victim, and the voices of women and children are not often heard, there is a feeling that some crimes are not being addressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Child abuse in Somalia is often hidden within households, and extended families are traditionally viewed as safe and private spaces – where the state should not interfere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diiriye's trial and other related hearings were broadcast live on social media to ensure public trust in the justice system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regional police commander Mohamud Abdihakim said the verdict marked an important moment in the pursuit of justice for the murdered teenager.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The perpetrator is now only awaiting the implementation of the death sentence.

The ministry also said that the charter's restriction on marriage before the age of 18 contradicted Sharia, which allows marriage when a girl reaches puberty – though in practice in Somalia the minimum age has been 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fadumo Ahmed, a women's and child's rights activist, argued that enforcement of similar measures that already existed in Somalia remained weak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police lack the capacity to deal with cases along with social services. Cases often get interfered with by clan elders, which undermines the justice system and victims' voices are not heard, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that children were often unaware that they could speak out and many schools were not teaching them that they could report abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In many similar cases [to Saabirin's], both sides of the family reach a behind-the-door agreement and then inform the government that the matter has been resolved,\" Ms Ahmed said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shukri Ahmed Hussein, the coordinator for Puntland's ministry of women's development and family affairs for the region that includes Galkayo, denies that the authorities are failing in their responsibility to protect children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC, she pointed out programmes to help youths who at one time had been recruited into armed groups, as well as efforts to protect street children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She did however admit that in cases like the one involving Saabirin, it is sometimes difficult to intervene. She acknowledged that more should be done to increase awareness that people can speak out if they suspect that a child might not be safe.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every child in Puntland has the right to be removed from any household in which they do not feel safe,\" Ms Hussein said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Saabirin's life was cut tragically short, her death is now forcing overdue conversations about child safety in Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as the local community reflects on the verdict, some are unsure if the justice will be served in the long run.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is nothing to celebrate yet, we still need clarity,\" one of the young protesters, Abdikadir Ali, said in a social media message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't want justice in words, we want to see it with our own eyes.
