Since he returned to office in January, recorded aerial attacks from Moscow have reached their highest levels of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to bring an end to fighting in just one day if returned to office. He claimed during his 2024 campaign that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been averted had a president who the Kremlin \"respected\" held office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pauses - announced in March and July and since reversed by the president - came as Russia steadily increased missile and drone production. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, ballistic missile construction in Russia grew by 66% over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared with 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long,\" White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to Nato members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. During this period, Russian attacks on Ukraine briefly fell when compared with the final weeks of the Biden administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The talks, which Rubio said were a starting point to bring an end to the war, have been followed by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crene7d5w2jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">mediated discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials</a> in Turkey. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Attacks peaked early last month, when Moscow launched 748 drones and missiles towards Ukraine on 9 July, according to the Ukrainian Air Force data. More than a dozen people were <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3rvpe06rxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reportedly injured by the barrage and two were killed</a>.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Trump has expressed anger at the escalating Russian attacks on several occasions, his mounting frustration does not appear to have had an impact on Moscow's strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: \"What the hell happened to him [Putin]?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. Trump has responded by demanding that the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c707zrrd7xqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Kremlin reach a peace deal with Ukraine by 8 August</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live,\" Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The growing attacks have renewed calls for the US to send fresh supplies of Patriot anti-air batteries to Ukraine. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has overturned the previous supply pauses and agreed to sell weapons to Nato members, who will in turn supply them to Kyiv. Trump appeared to imply that the deal would include fresh supplies of Patriot batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Justin Bronk, an analyst focussing on the Russian military at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said restrictions on the supply of military equipment imposed by the White House had made Ukraine \"vulnerable\" to missile and drone attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also noted that Russia has ramped up the production of missiles and so-called 'kamikaze' drones such as the Geran-2 - a domestically produced version of the Iranian Shahed drone. Mr Bronk said that Russia's increased stockpiles, coupled with \"significant reductions\" in supply of US interceptor missiles had encouraged Moscow to escalate its air campaign.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A captured Geran drone in Ukraine.

The plan was to build its hull - the part where the passengers would sit - out of carbon fibre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No deep diving sub had been made out of this material before - most have hulls constructed from titanium or steel. But Lochridge had confidence in the APL team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said he was told by Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush that the craft would undergo a safety assessment by an independent marine organisation, known as certification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge was adamant that this third-party oversight was essential - especially because Titan was to be made of experimental materials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But by the summer of 2016 he was starting to have doubts about the project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate stopped working with APL and decided to bring the design and construction of Titan in-house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge was worried. He didn't have the same confidence in Oceangate's engineers. He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And he identified issues with other key components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"David Lochridge David Lochridge onboard the deck of a ship.

He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I brought up all the issues that I was seeing… but I was just met with resistance all the way,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Titan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Towards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: \"I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks.\" he said. \"OSHA did nothing.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'They beat us down'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned… We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. \"I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had \"followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety… but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The spokesperson said: \"The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG. It said action has now been taken to improve this following the disaster. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jason Neubauer,  the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate said that in the wake of the accident, it had permanently wound down operations and directed its resources towards cooperating with the inquiry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Moderna and Pfizer's mRNA vaccines were tested in thousands of people before being rolled out and were found to be safe and effective. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Offit, who invented the rotavirus vaccine, said the funding cancellation could put the US in a \"more dangerous\" position to respond to any potential future pandemic. He noted mRNA vaccines have a shorter development cycle, which is why they were crucial to responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since taking office, Kennedy has taken a number of steps to transform how the nation's health department develops and regulates vaccines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June, he fired all 17 members of a committee that issues official government recommendations on immunisations, replacing them with some people who have criticized the safety and efficacy of vaccines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also removed the Covid-19 vaccine from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump has also admitted that he did not know whether sanctions \"bothered\" Putin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US president may be hoping that Russia's trading partners will be sufficiently inconvenienced by the tariffs that they will choose to pivot away from buying Moscow's oil - ultimately making a dent in the revenue the Kremlin needs to continue waging its war on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday Trump said he would <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly647wx9l3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">impose hefty new tariffs on India</a>, a major buyer of Russian oil, accusing it of not caring \"how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian War Machine\". The Kremlin said \"attemps to force countries to cut trade relations with Russia\" were \"illegal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his Telegram post Zelensky said he and Trump had also talked about the \"increased brutality\" of Russian strikes on Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US president has previously referenced Moscow's repeated attacks on Ukrainian cities, signalling irritation that the bombings often follow \"nice\" phone conversations between himself and Putin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Only last February Zelensky was asked to leave the White House after a disastrous meeting in which the US president accused him of not being thankful enough for US aid and of \"gambling with World War Three\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two men have gradually repaired their relationship. In July Trump said the US would sell \"top-of-the-line weapons\" to Nato members which would then pass them on to Kyiv - and this week it was announced that Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Sweden would be the first countries to buy weapons from the US under this scheme. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their combined contributions will amount to more than $1bn and will go towards air defence equipment and ammunition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said speed was \"absolutely critical\" and that Denmark would be willing to consider additional funding later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than three years on from Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainian cities continue to come under heavy bombardment and regular drone attacks. Over the last day six people were killed across eastern Ukraine, authorities said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before taking office Trump repeatedly said he would be able to end the conflict within a day - and it was at his behest that Russia and Ukraine sat down for ceasefire talks for the first time last May. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the discussions failed to bring the two sides any closer to peace and the US president has appeared increasingly impatient with the lack of progress. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite Trump’s looming deadline, Vladimir Putin last week poured cold water on any hopes of a swift, long-term ceasefire with Ukraine. Although he said he viewed talks with Kyiv \"positively,\" he also noted that \"all disappointments arise from inflated expectations\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Relief and rescue teams are engaged in every possible effort. No stone is being left unturned in providing assistance to the people,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier, Prashant Arya, the senior-most official of Uttarkashi, said communication had been erratic because of poor connectivity in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As it's a populated area with lots of restaurants and hotels, we've dispatched rescue teams to the site,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dharali is located 2km (1.24 miles) from Harsil, which is a popular tourist destination and also has a huge Indian army base. A camp of the paramilitary Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) is also located near the area. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Personnel from the two forces have reached the site of the disaster and officials said they were assessing the situation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But rescue is expected to be slow because the area is continuing to receive heavy rains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the injured are receiving treatment at the army camp in Harsil, reports say.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness.

Both have long denied any wrongdoing and accuse Trump of subverting the justice system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Half of Trump's first presidency was overshadowed by an investigation from his own justice department into whether he had conspired with Russia to sway the 2016 outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The resulting Mueller report found no proof that Trump or his campaign had co-ordinated with the Kremlin, and no-one was charged with such crimes.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The debate over Russiagate was reinvigorated last week when an appendix to another justice department investigation into the affair was declassified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.grassley.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/declassified_durham_annex_released_by_chairman_grassley.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">The 29 pages</a> from Special Counsel John Durham's inquiry cites a March 2016 memo from a US intelligence source stating that Hillary Clinton had approved a plan to smear Trump as a Russian asset. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Durham cites \"what appear or purport to be original\" emails that hackers affiliated with Russian intelligence might have obtained from an employee with a non-profit organisation run by liberal donor George Soros.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the messages appeared to have been sent by Leonard Benardo, senior vice-president at Open Society Foundations, Soros' philanthropic arm. It apparently refers to a Clinton foreign policy adviser, Julianna Smith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The email, dated 26 July 2016, reads: \"Julie says it will be a long-term affair to demonize Putin and Trump. Now it is good for a post-convention bounce. Later the FBI will put more oil into the fire.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is nothing illegal about a political smear, but Trump allies suggested the email, if genuine, showed that federal investigators could have been part of the scheme. Durham, however, found no proof of such an FBI conspiracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the appendix, Benardo told Durham that \"to the best of his recollection\" he did not draft the email, although he noted that some of the verbiage further down sounded like something he would have said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The special counsel also interviewed Smith, who said she did not recall receiving such an email from Benardo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Durham made no determination in his appendix whether the emails were authentic, or if they had been doctored by Russian spies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Omar Waraich, a director at Open Society Foundations, told the BBC the Benardo emails were \"crude forgeries\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The claims that Open Society helped orchestrate an FBI investigation are outrageous and false,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/newsroom/false-reckless-and-dangerous-claims-against-open-society-and-its-staff-on-durham-report\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">a statement from the nonprofit</a> said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Durham's main 306-page report, published in 2023, found the original FBI probe into Trump's campaign had lacked \"analytical rigor\" and relied on \"raw, unanalysed and uncorroborated intelligence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US officials found the Russian meddling in 2016 included bot farms on social media and hacking of Democratic emails, but they ultimately concluded the impact was probably limited and did not actually change the election result.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It's not as though an infected patient will then go around biting other people?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China implemented severe restrictions during the pandemic, including forcing people into quarantine camps and sealing residential buildings and whole neighbourhoods on short notice for days or even weeks.  </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What is chikungunya?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most people bitten by an infected mosquito will develop symptoms of chikungunya within three to seven days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Apart from fever and joint pain, other symptoms include rash, headache, muscle pain and swollen joints. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In most cases, patients will feel better within a week. In severe cases however, the joint pain can last for months or even years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those at risk for more severe disease include newborns, the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no cure, but deaths from chikungunya are rare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The virus was first identified in Tanzania in 1952.

A signal flare arcs into the inky sky – and illuminates Chinese soldiers who have spilled out of the boat and amassed on the beach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This is the key scenario in Zero Day Attack, a new Taiwanese television show about a fictional Chinese military invasion.

About two months later, he finally made it to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan, a soft-spoken man in his late 50s from a small village in Jiangxi province in eastern China, is one of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals who have made the same journey in recent years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Known colloquially as zou xian ke, or \"those who walked the line\", they represent a new wave of migration driven by authoritarian tightening at home and the belief – sometimes naive, often desperate – that the US still offers a fair shot at a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their reasons for exodus varied, but their experiences once on American soil follow certain trends: many have ended up isolated by language, burdened by debt and surviving on gig work as they wait for their asylum claims to crawl through an overwhelming immigration system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some remain hopeful. Others are unravelling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And all of them, now, are living in the long shadow of President Donald Trump's political return - during which the poor US-China relations of recent years have soured even further. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Fatman Ding Plaza, sitting in the centre of Monterey Park, a city outside of Los Angeles, is the \"ground zero\" of Chinese migrants who came to the US</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'Hard work here brings hope'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan is one of several Chinese migrants who I first met two years ago. Like many of the group who he travelled with, he now works in a Chinese restaurant, even though back home, he prided himself on his farming know-how. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In America, those skills don't translate, since the soil conditions are different and he doesn't speak English. Past lives hold little currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a while after arriving, Pan wandered from city to city, sleeping on borrowed couches or bunking with fellow migrants. Eventually, he landed in Barstow, California, a dusty industrial town.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His life today is penned within a tight radius. He cooks and sometimes waits tables at a restaurant during the day, video-calls his wife and children in China at night, and repeats the routine the next day. He lives in a room attached to the kitchen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To outsiders, and even to his family back home, Pan's life might seem unbearably monotonous. But to him, it's defined not by what's lacking, but by what's no longer present. No land seizures. No meddling officials. No fear of arbitrary punishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My family doesn't understand,\" he said with a half-smile. \"They ask why I left a comfortable life behind. But here, even if it's simple, it's mine. It's free.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan's sense of freedom is quiet but stubborn. Two years ago, in a cramped hotel room in Quito, Ecuador, he told me on the eve of his journey that even if he died en route, it would be worth it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He still says the same. \"All of this,\" he repeated, \"is worth it.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Like many newcomers, Pan doesn't have any meaningful social circle – the mounting language and cultural difference challenges confine his life to interactions with fellow migrants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Occasionally, he travels to Los Angeles to join protests outside the Chinese consulate. He admits that is partly to strengthen his asylum claim by establishing a public record of political dissent. But it is also because, after decades of silence, he can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 4 June, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre – a date scrubbed from China's public memory by the authorities – he stood again outside the consulate chanting anti-Chinese Communist Party slogans. That day, among the familiar crowd, he spotted James.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A young man in his early 30s who hailed from western China, James had travelled with Pan from Ecuador through the Darién Gap and up to the US border. But if Pan's story is one of quiet stoicism, James's is more kinetic, more restless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After his release from a US immigration detention centre, James bounced between cash gigs in Monterey Park, a Chinese-majority suburb east of Los Angeles. He ultimately bought a cargo van, drove out to Palm Springs, and made the car both his livelihood and his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The van is cluttered with sleeping bags, gas canisters, and a portable charger - that's all he needs to be content with his life. During the day, he delivers food around the city; at night, he parks outside a 24-hour gym and sleeps with the windows open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">James was always a hustler in China. But after Covid tanked the economy and political crackdowns left little room to breathe, he decided to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At least your hard work here brings hope, but back in China, you could work over ten hours a day and see no future,\" James told me.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">James, from China's western Qinghai province, is now a delivery driver in Palm Springs, California</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'America is becoming another China'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet hope alone isn't enough. For nearly all the newcomers, including James and Pan who are by and large content with their life in the US, Trump's political return has brought back a gnawing sense of instability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The wave of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across southern California, Trump's continuous push to deport undocumented immigrants, and rising US-China tensions including a battle over trade tariffs, have all deepened a climate of paranoia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As I was re-connecting with the migrants who I first met in 2023, clashes between protesters and the government police forces were unfolding in downtown Los Angeles over recent ICE raids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The raids were part of the president's aim to enact the \"biggest deportation operation\" in US history - a pledge that helped him to win the White House again last year. A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June found 54% of Americans saying they approved of his deportation policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The administration says its raids have primarily targeted people with criminal records, although critics say innocent people have been caught up in the drive - sparking anxiety among migrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly all of the migrants I reconnected with now hold what's called an Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) that allows them to legally work in the US, but they have not been granted official asylum status. In Trump's expansive ICE raid campaign, people who hold exactly the same status as these migrants have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But what's the driving the fear is a sense of unknowing - of if and when these raids will reach the Chinese community, or when the next downturn of China-US relations could be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Between the two Trump presidencies, US-China relations hardly improved when Joe Biden served in the White House. The Democrat kept earlier Trump tariffs in place, and tensions rose as Beijing escalated its rhetoric over the status of US ally Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For some, all the unease has prompted a question that many Chinese migrants have quietly begun to ask themselves: is America worth it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kevin, a man in his thirties from China's Fujian province, didn't think so. Like Pan and James, Kevin journeyed through Latin America to reach the US. But the American dream he once believed in now feels like a mirage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When I asked him how settled he was in California's San Gabriel Valley, where he lives with his wife and their newborn son, he referred to the ICE raids in LA and answered: \"Everything feels uncertain. So no, I don't feel settled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kevin's disillusionment runs deep. \"America, to me, feels like it's becoming another China,\" he said. \"A Darwinian society.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If I had known what it would really be like, I might not have come,\" he continued.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Caught in a pincer</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a long time, what bound all these migrants was the journey they shared on that treacherous road.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now, that binding has an extra layer: the emotional undercurrent they now swim against two years after they arrived in the US. It is the creeping realisation that their place in America is precarious, that the country they bet everything on might not have space for them after all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The zouxian wave was driven by desperation – but also by an almost childlike faith in the American idea: that this country, for all its flaws, still offered a shot at dignity. A delivery job. A sliver of land. A bed behind a restaurant where no one came knocking at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, with Trump portraying China as national security threat, warning of \"infiltration,\" and promising sweeping crackdowns on many things China-related, even those modest hopes feel more under siege than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The effect is clear. This new wave of Chinese migrants – many of them still awaiting asylum – now feel themselves caught in a pincer: mistrusted by Americans, unwanted by Beijing, and sometimes suspended in legal limbo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan, for one, is bracing for the worst. \"The future here doesn't feel as certain anymore,\" he said, standing outside the restaurant in Barstow, watching the freeway traffic blur past. \"I'm worried I might not be allowed to stay. And if I go back to China…\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He trailed off. For a moment, he said nothing. Then he looked at me, steady, calm, resigned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That thought,\" he said, \"is unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was the same look I remembered from that hotel room in Quito, two years and a world ago: worry flickering behind tired eyes, but beneath it, a core of absolute resolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No matter what happens, Pan told me, he's staying.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That led to a spike in inflation around the world. President Trump says he isn't worried because of record US oil production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Tompkins points out that, this time, there are also other reasons to suggest the impact on prices would not be as marked. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explains that \"the current backdrop is one where OPEC+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example, its so-called \"shadow fleet\" - consisting of hundreds of tankers with obscure ownership - could be used to conceal the origin of exported Russian oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sanctions maintenance is as big a task as the imposition of sanctions in the first place,\" US sanctions expert Richard Nephew of Columbia University says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Two young people carry a handpainted poster of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump with the writing \"Unpredictable &amp; shocking 25% tariff + penalty\"' class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" the country's foreign ministry said</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Pricier iPhones from India</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.russiafossiltracker.com/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're fuelling the war machine. And if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy,\" President Trump told US outlet CNBC on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If secondary sanctions take effect, US companies buying goods from India will have to pay a 100% import tax - or tariff - when those products reach US shores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The idea is that it makes these goods so expensive that US businesses will choose to buy them cheaper from elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That, in turn, is supposed to deter India from buying Russian oil. And if Russia is left unable to sell its oil elsewhere because other countries face the same predicament, it will have less cash to finance the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One way in which Americans could experience higher prices as a result of new secondary tariffs is in their purchase of mobile phones from India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">production to India</a> - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If these products are subject to the new tariffs, prices could double for US consumers. That is because tariffs are paid by the companies that import goods - and those companies tend to pass most, if not all, of their cost increases on to their customers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Imports to the US from India are already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up, and he told CNBC that number could be raised \"very substantially\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's government has accused the US of double standards, pointing to Washington's own continued trade with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from India which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that's just 10% of 2021 levels. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That trade is dominated by US purchases of raw materials for nuclear energy and fertilizers.

Brussels recently agreed to buy a lot <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">more energy from the US</a>, but some imports from Russia remain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1504\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">acknowledged the problem</a>, saying \"Russia has repeatedly attempted to blackmail us by weaponizing its energy supplies\" as she laid out plans to end imports by the end of 2027.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US-EU trade relationship is the biggest in the world, and the pair have just negotiated new trade terms<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>which will see a 15% tariff be applied on most EU exports to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many in the EU <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgp5q4x4nzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">criticised that deal</a>, saying the tariffs would harm European exporters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now they also fear that secondary sanctions on the EU could do even more harm. Adding 100% tariffs for buying Russian energy could significantly reduce the amount of goods sold by the EU to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However the biggest sellers include pharmaceuticals and machinery, which may be hard to source from elsewhere - meaning Americans have little choice but to pay more. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Potential Russian recession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's own economy has so far proven remarkably resilient since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, growing 4.3% last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqnj17vryjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">recently warned</a> that the country was \"on the verge\" of recession after a period of \"overheating\". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting growth of just 0.9% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If the secondary sanctions are successful in reducing demand for exports, they will push Russia closer to recession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The exact impact of the war on Russia's economy is hard to know, because Moscow has prevented a large amount of economic data from being published since the full-scale invasion - including on oil and gas production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About a third of Russian government spending is funded by oil and gas money, but exports have been falling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Putin is directing a bigger share of spending towards defence than at any time since the Cold War. Defence spending is believed to have reached 6.3% of GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By contrast, Ukraine has been spending a huge 26% of the value of its far-smaller economy on the war. The difference explains why its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly asked for external help from his allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's tariffs are intended to help Zelensky by cutting the amount of money flowing into Russia, and he hopes bring an end to the death, suffering and destruction in Ukraine.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

By the 1980s, Iliescu was out of politics and working as a director at a government-affiliated academic publishing house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His re-emergence during the 1989 revolution, which lasted from 16-25 December and saw more than 1,000 people killed, was seen by some as opportunistic, but to others, it was a stabilising presence amid chaos. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As leader of the National Salvation Front (FSN), a political organisation that formed during the revolution, Iliescu became Romania's interim president and oversaw the rapid dismantling of Ceausescu's regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Christmas Day, Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad after a trial at a military base that lasted two hours.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: The fall of the Ceaușescus - when Romania stood up to tyranny</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 1990, he won Romania's first democratic election in more than 50 years with a staggering 85% of the vote. But the campaign was marred by disinformation and state-aligned propaganda against liberal rivals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later that year, Iliescu faced growing protests from students and opposition supporters. His now-infamous call for miners to descend on the capital to \"restore order\" led to days of brutal street violence known as the Mineriads, during which dozens were injured and several killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He served another full term after winning the 1992 elections, then returned for a final presidency between 2000 and 2004.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Turbulent years followed the revolution. Deep-rooted and insidious influential figures, dating back to the communist era persisted, and Iliescu's presidency was marked by widespread corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Critics argue that his reluctance to fully reform the justice system or confront the legacy of the Securitate – the feared secret police – allowed a culture of impunity to take root. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than three decades on from the revolution, Romania still struggles with political corruption and remains one of the poorest and most corrupt members of the European Union – a reality that some trace back to Iliescu's rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His later years in office saw progress on Romania's Western integration – including Nato membership and the closing of EU accession talks. There were also market reforms, allowing small businesses to open, and Romania adopted its first democratic constitution in 1991, which still shapes the country today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Iliescu remained dogged by questions over his role in the bloodshed of the early 1990s.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2017, he was formally indicted for crimes against humanity in connection with both the 1989 revolution and the 1990 Mineriads. The legal proceedings dragged on for years without resolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After stepping down, Iliescu remained a respected figure within the Social Democratic Party (PSD), eventually being named honorary president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He largely withdrew from public life in his later years but occasionally posted political commentary on his personal blog. His final entry, in May 2025, congratulated President Nicusor Dan on his electoral victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ion Iliescu built Romania's democracy, Teodor Tita says, but he was \"also a ruthless politician who wasn't afraid to incite violent conflicts between competing parts of the society\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As a politician, Iliescu was ruthless, skilful and always with an eye to history.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He has also threatened to expel them from office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Democrats left because at least two-thirds of the 150-member legislative body must be present to proceed with a vote on re-drawing Texas's electoral map. The plan would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing – but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections. At its heart, it's a bare-knuckle fight over political power, who can wield it most effectively and who can keep it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why does Trump want redistricting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US House of Representatives is made up of 435 legislators who are elected every two years. They represent districts with boundaries determined in processes set by their state governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Who draws the lines and how can go a long way in shaping the ideological tilt of the district and the likelihood that it elects a Democrat or a Republican.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the moment, the House rests on a knife edge with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. There are four vacancies likely to be filled by three Democrats and one Republican in special elections later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It wouldn't take much of a shift in the political winds for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections. And the party that controls the lower chamber of Congress has powers that extend far beyond simply setting the legislative agenda for the next two years, as important as that may be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">House leaders can launch sweeping investigations of presidential actions, as Democrats did in the second half of Donald Trump's first term and Republicans did in Joe Biden's final two years. They can also dig in on policy issues and trigger government shutdowns. They can even vote to impeach a president, as Democrats did in December 2019 and Republicans contemplated during Biden's presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump appears focused on taking steps to improve his odds of avoiding a similar fate in his second term.

The most recent regularly scheduled redistricting took place in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In some states, the process is set by independent commissions but in others the state legislatures are responsible for line-drawing – and the results can frequently be crafted by the party in power to give their side a distinct advantage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In North Carolina, for instance, Republican-drawn lines gave their party 10 of the state's 14 House seats in last year's national elections even though Trump only won the state by a slim margin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Democrats in Illinois hold 14 of the state's 17 House seats, while former Vice-President Kamala Harris won the state with 54%. If Trump has his way, and the maps lead to a five-seat gain next year, Republicans would control 30 of the state's 38 seats. Last year, he won Texas with 56%.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">So what could happen next?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Republican push in Texas has leaders in Democratic-controlled states calling for a response, which could set off a redistricting \"arms race\" that spreads across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, has asked legislators in his state, where Democrats control 43 of the 52 seats, to find ways to increase their advantage. Governors Kathy Hochul in New York and JB Pritzker in Illinois have issued similar calls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Everything's on the table,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on social media. \"We've got to do everything we can to stand up and fight back - we're not sitting around and complaining from the sidelines when we have the ability to stop them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Grassroots Democrats, many of whom have been frustrated by the inability of their party's national political leaders to block the Trump administration's policy agenda, may welcome such confrontational language. States like California and New York have laws that mandate congressional districts be drawn by a bipartisan commission to create constituencies that are compact and fair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such efforts were the result of a push to remove political considerations from the redistricting process, but now some Democrats view those moves as unilateral disarmament that gave Republicans an advantage in the fight for a House majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,\" Hochul told reporters at the New York Capitol in Albany on Monday. \"With all due respect to the good government groups, politics is a political process.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said the \"playing field\" has changed dramatically during Trump's second term and Democrats need to adjust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Democrats may not have the final say, however. Republicans are already looking beyond Texas for more places to pick up seats. Vice-President JD Vance is reported to be considering a trip to Indiana later this week to push for new district lines in that state. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently said his Republican-dominated state may undertake a similar process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite its explicit political designs, all of this is fair game under the US Constitution – at least the way a narrow majority of the US Supreme Court interpreted it in a landmark 2019 case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Partisan \"gerrymandering\", as the process is sometimes called, has a long tradition in US politics – one that frequently creates oddly shaped constituencies that stretch for miles to include, or exclude, voters based on their political affiliations, all with the goal of giving one party an electoral majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Republican move in Texas isn't even without precedent. In 2003, Republican leaders redrew their congressional maps to boost their electoral advantage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The state's Democrats even responded in a similar way – leaving the state to delay the legislative proceedings. The redistricting ultimately passed after enough Democrats returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a risk in all of this, even for the party doing the line-drawing. While the goal is to maximise the number of seats where victory is probable, in an election where one side outperforms expectations even seemingly safe seats can flip sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Texas, and other redistricting states, could create an electoral map that does not survive a political deluge, leading to otherwise avoidable losses at the ballot box.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a close election, however, every seat counts. And if next year's midterm elections continue the recent trend of narrowly decided political battles, what happens in state legislatures over the next few months could have dramatic political consequences in Washington DC – and, consequently, across America.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

It would \"consider expanding the definition of victims\" to second- and- third-generation survivors only \"if the results are statistically significant\", it said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The Korean toll</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Of the 140,000 Koreans in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, many were from Hapcheon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Surrounded by mountains with little farmland, it was a difficult place to live. Crops were seized by the Japanese occupiers, droughts ravaged the land, and thousands of people left the rural country for Japan during the war. Some were forcibly conscripted; others were lured by the promise that \"you could eat three meals a day and send your kids to school.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in Japan, Koreans were second-class citizens – often given the hardest, dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. Mr Shim says his father worked in a munitions factory as a forced labourer, while his mother hammered nails into wooden ammunition crates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the aftermath of the bomb, this distribution of labour translated into dangerous and often fatal work for Koreans in Hiroshima.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Hyojung Kim An old man in a chequered blazer sits in front of a black-and-white photograph showing destroyed streets and debris \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/Hyojung Kim</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">For Shim Jin-tae, it's not just about being compensated – it's about being acknowledged</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Korean workers had to clean up the dead,\" Mr Shim, who is the director of the Hapcheon branch of the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, tells BBC Korean. \"At first they used stretchers, but there were too many bodies. Eventually, they used dustpans to gather corpses and burned them in schoolyards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was mostly Koreans who did this.

While Japanese evacuees fled to relatives, Koreans without local ties remained in the city, exposed to the radioactive fallout – and with  limited access to medical care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A combination of these conditions - poor treatment, hazardous work and structural discrimination - all contributed to a disproportionately high death toll among Koreans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, the Korean fatality rate was  57.1%, compared to the overall rate of about 33.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About 70,000 Koreans were exposed to the bomb.

But they were not welcomed. Branded as disfigured or cursed, they faced prejudice even in their homeland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hapcheon already had a leper colony,\" Mr Shim explains. \"And because of that image, people thought the bomb survivors had skin diseases too.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such stigma made survivors stay silent about their plight, he adds, suggesting that \"survival came before pride\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Lee says she saw this \"with her own eyes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People who were badly burned or extremely poor were treated terribly,\" she recalls. \"In our village, some people had their backs and faces so badly scarred that only their eyes were visible.

Her first son was born with cerebral palsy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My son has never walked a single step in his life,\" she says. \"And my in-laws treated me horribly.

That survey was mostly based on questionnaires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to BBC inquiries, the ministry explained that prior to 2019, \"There was no legal basis for funding or official investigations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But two separate studies had found that second-generation victims were more vulnerable to illness. One, from 2005, showed that second-generation victims were far more likely than the general population to suffer depression, heart disease and anaemia, while another from 2013 found their disability registration rate was nearly double the national average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Against this backdrop, Ms Han is incredulous that authorities keep asking for proof to recognise her and her son as victims of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My illness is the proof.

Everything feels extravagant, emotional and larger than life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now imagine all of that without the bride and groom. No pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual where the couple takes seven rounds around a sacred fire), no relatives, no tearful farewells. Just the party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Welcome to the world of fake weddings - a rising trend in Indian cities where people gather to enjoy the wedding party, minus the actual marriage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These ticketed events, organised by hotels, clubs and companies, are designed purely for fun and promise to offer the full experience of a wedding party without any stress, rituals or responsibilities. Simply put, it's a wedding-themed party night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the past few weeks, fake weddings have been making a splash in big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The attendees are usually young people looking to enjoy a night out with friends, indulging in the drama and fun of a traditional Indian wedding without the attendant pressures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, we attended one such curated event in Delhi - a fake sangeet<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i>(a sangeet is a night of music and dance usually held a few days before the wedding).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the event, held at a plush club, the vibe was electric: women twirled in sequinned saris and lehengas (long skirts and blouses), men showed up in tailored kurtas and ethnic jackets. A traditional dhol drummer led the crowd to the dance floor and tequila-filled gol gappas (a popular Indian street snack) made the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shivangi Sareen, who attended an event like this for the first time, found it \"amazing\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Shivangi Sareen, right, said the fake sangeet was a memorable experience</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At family weddings, there's so much pressure - the rules around dressing up, the judgement [from relatives]. But here, it's just fun,\" she said. \"Especially because we got to do it all with our friends. We decided our outfits the day before and got ready together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ticket prices typically start at around 1,500 rupees ($17; £13) and can go up to 15,000 rupees or more, depending on the venue and facilities. Shivangi and her friends paid 10,000 rupees per couple to attend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I wouldn't mind spending this once a month. The whole experience was totally worth it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sharad Madan, owner of a restaurant which hosted the event, says the trend underscores that novelty is key in the hospitality sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to keep doing something new for our patrons,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It cost them around a million rupees to plan and organise the event, Mr Madan says, and the team expected to make double that through ticket sales. But it's not just about profits, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's about engagement. Even if it doesn't give me the same kind of returns, I would still do it because our patrons want something different.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kaushal Chanani, co-founder of 8Club events which hosted a fake wedding party attended by 2,000 people in Bengaluru last month, says that the inspiration for fake weddings came from young Indians living abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People from the diaspora would gather and dance to Bollywood music, dress in ethnic [traditional] clothes and enjoy the evening,\" he said. \"This is the idea we followed as well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The response to the Bengaluru event, held at a five-star hotel, was \"overwhelming\", he says. It encouraged them to plan a similar event in Delhi - which was sold out - and they started getting queries from event organisers in other cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata and Lucknow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We now give out our standard operating procedure (SOP) to people who are interested,\" he says. \"It is a guide on how to create the experience, market it and make it profitable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, not all fake weddings follow the same script.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Trippy Tequila A woman dancing while showing her back.
