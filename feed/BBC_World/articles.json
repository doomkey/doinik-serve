Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has revived his long-standing interest with Greenland, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has refused to rule out using force to secure control of the island, a stance that has shocked Denmark, a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dispute comes as strategic competition in the Arctic grows, with melting ice opening new shipping routes and increasing access to valuable mineral resources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland's location between North America and Europe also makes it central to US and Nato security planning and puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/news/abanews/aba-news-archives/2019/06/house-panel-contempt-efforts/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the American Bar Association</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant during an interview with another broadcaster on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent fighting has seen <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mpje3e2xmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border</a>. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jonathan-head-and-thanyarat-doksone\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of Brent crude rose 53 cents to $60.99 a barrel, while US oil was up 1.6% to $57.40. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're afraid of our own government.

Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October.

The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village.

But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January.

That plan shocked Ukraine and its European allies for appearing to favour Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff said representatives from Russia had met himself and other US officials in southern Florida, including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meetings with Russian envoy Dmitriev were also \"productive and constructive\", Witkoff said, adding that \"Russia remains fully committed to achieving peace in Ukraine\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday the Kremlin said Dmitriev would travel back to Moscow to debrief Vladimir Putin on US proposals for a potential settlement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suggestions that a three-way meeting between the US, Russia and Ukraine could be on the cards were brushed off by Moscow. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has been pushing Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the war, but so far the two countries have been unable to agree on major issues, including Moscow's demand to be handed sections of the Donbas regions it has not managed to seize militarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin still wants to capture all of Ukraine and reclaim parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire, six sources familiar with US intelligence told the Reuters news agency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This absolutely does not correspond to reality,\" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The comments came after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp89p082y2xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Putin told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg</a> that there will be no more wars after Ukraine, if Russia is treated with respect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has recently intensified its attacks on Ukraine's southern region of Odesa. Ukrainian officials have said the strikes - which on Sunday night hit port and energy infrastructure - were aiming to limit Ukraine's access to the Black Sea and disrupt critical logistics routes to the border with Moldova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels and two piers in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, Russian officials said on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The damage led to a big fire, but Russian authorities say all crew were safely evacuated.

That is what it means. Not in the Middle East, not in Israel or Gaza but here in Sydney\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do believe it leads to a culture and environment of heightened disunity,\" he said, and \"an invitation to violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The term intifada came into popular use during the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1987.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have described the term as a call for violence against Jewish people. Others have said it is a call for peaceful resistance to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and actions in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the aftermath of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqjg22rey0lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Bondi attacks</a>, in which 15 people were killed, the Jewish community accused the government of not doing enough to protect it from rising antisemitism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new protest laws will also allow police to restrict demonstrations at places of worship, with stronger penalties for breaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Timothy Roberts, president of the NSW Council for Civil Liberties, said the new law ignores a recent decision by the state's supreme court which found the so-called \"move-on power\" at religious locations went against Australia's implied constitutional freedom of political communication.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Religious institutions exercise significant and overt political power in Australian politics and this makes them a legitimate site of protest in a democratic society, Mr Roberts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The laws introduced today are an affront to our right to assemble and communicate with each other,\" he said, adding they \"damage our democracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Minns wants social cohesion but he does not know the meaning of the term. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He thinks silence is peace, and does not seem to realise it can also reflect oppression. Passing laws that oppress some parts of our community in the wake of an attack like we saw, does not bring us closer - it drives us further apart and stops us from healing well in this time of grief.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police will also be able to remove face coverings from protesters who are suspected of committing an offence - including low-level offences - during a protest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously, police could only do so if someone is arrested or suspected of committing an indictable offence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On gun reform, the new laws will mean licence holders in NSW cannot own more than four firearms with exceptions for farmers and sport shooters who can have up to ten. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move follows similar laws introduced in Western Australia earlier this year to cap gun ownership. Elsewhere across the country, there are no limits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the gunmen in the Bondi shooting, Sajid Akram, had six registered firearms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other gun law changes include more regular renewals for gun licence holders from every five years to every two years, and a review of the types of firearms available to most gun owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Banasiak from the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party - which lobbies for more relaxed gun laws - said the state's 260,000 gun licence holders were being \"punished\" and \"made a scapegoat for agency failings\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're diverting away from what the real problem is,\" he said, referring to \"a climate of hate and division that's been allowed to fester for two and a half years because government haven't done enough to stop that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walter Mikac, whose wife and two young daughters were among the 35 people shot dead in Tasmania by a lone gunman in 1996 in what is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxql12317qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Australia's deadliest mass shooting</a>, welcomed the reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The changes will \"close critical gaps in our gun laws\" and put community safety first, he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government also aims to crackdown on hate speech and symbols, as well as enabling police to ban protests for up to three months after a terrorist attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palestine Action Group spokesperson Josh Lees said the new laws were \"incredibly draconian\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australia is seen as a safe country,\" he said, \"where freedom of speech is very important\" but the Bondi shooting was \"perhaps changing the dynamics of that democracy and that freedom\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">David Ossip, president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said moves to ban \"intifada\" chants was a \"watershed moment\" in confronting hate and incitement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also welcomed greater police powers during protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The right to protest is a core Australian value and a fundamental tenet of a democratic society,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But it has never included the right to hide your face and shout slogans calling for violence against one's fellow Australians or waving the flags of groups devoted to murder and destruction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-katy-watson\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Katy Watson</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

Sixty-three people were killed every day on average between April and September this year, according to police figures. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murders are often the result of arguments, robberies and gang violence. The motive for this attack is not clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the scene, deputy provincial police commissioner Maj-Gen Fred Kekana told  broadcaster Newzroom Afrika that the perpetrators, armed with pistols and one AK-47, were \"unprovoked\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The poor patrons were just enjoying themselves when people came and shot,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two of the victims were shot outside the tavern as they tried to flee and a third was a taxi driver who had dropped off a passenger nearby, Maj-Gen Kekana added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Resident Nokuthula Bhukwana went to the tavern after she heard the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we arrived at the scene, we opened the doors and indeed scores of people were lying on the floor,\" she told the Reuters news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We rushed around and others were calling the police, and we also called the ambulance and they arrived. We had to carry some of the injured people using wheelbarrows to the clinic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to Newzroom Afrika, one resident described how gunfire had become a normal thing at night in Bekkersdal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Criminals, they do as they please here,\" the unnamed man said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These guns, they sound each and every evening... as soon as it's dusk we know that gunshots are about to sound and they will sound severely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is terrorising our communities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interviewed at the scene, deputy mayor for the local municipality Nontombi Molatlhegi said that locals were afraid of speaking out and identifying those responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said that the police were under-resourced, and too thinly spread, and called for the military to get involved in protecting residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are crying, as well as the city political leadership, for the intervention of the national government to release [the army] so that they can be able to come in this space\" and be visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are about three million legally held firearms in South Africa, but there are at least the same number of unlicensed weapons in circulation in the country, which has a population of 63 million, according to statistics cited by Gideon Joubert from the South African Gunowners' Association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyvkrkl2jlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">at least 11 people - including a child - were shot dead at a hostel near Pretoria</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been a significant increase in mass shootings - where four or more people are either killed or injured - since 2020, Claire Taylor, a researcher at campaign group Gun Free South Africa, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking at media reports from 2024 her organisation recorded 80 such incidents, which was up from 71 the previous year. There has, however, been a decline in reported mass shootings in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most common locations are licensed taverns, such as in Bekkersdal this weekend, or illegal drinking spots, known locally as shebeens, which was the case in the 6 December killings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-damian-zane\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Damian Zane</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

But only some have been released, many with numerous redactions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawmakers who pushed for these documents to see the light of day have described the DOJ's efforts as insincere, and some legal experts say that the redactions may only fuel ongoing conspiracy theories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We just want all of the evidence of these crimes out there,\" Epstein survivor Liz Stein told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Stein told Radio 4's Today programme that she thought the justice department was \"really brazenly going against the Epstein Files Transparency Act\" - the law that requires all the documents to be released.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Survivors are really worried about the possibility of a \"slow roll-out of incomplete information without any context\", she noted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marina Lacerda, who was 14 when she was abused by Epstein, also told the BBC some of the survivors were \"still nervous and sceptical about how they are going to release the rest of the files\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are very worried that it will still be redacted in the same way that it was today. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are a little disappointed that they're now still lingering on and distracting us with other things.\" </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Justice Epstein poses with Michael Jackson \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Justice</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Epstein poses with Michael Jackson </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the latest released information is a photo of Epstein now jailed confidante Ghislaine Maxwell outside Downing Street - the UK prime minister's office and residence - a document that claims Epstein introduced a 14-year-old girl to US President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and multiple images of former President Bill Clinton.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other released photos show the interiors of Epstein's homes, his overseas travels, as well as celebrities, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Peter Mandelson - former UK Labour Party politician and ambassador to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 15 of the released files were no longer available on the DOJ website on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a desk, according to CBS, the BBC's media partner in the US. The photos showed Bill Clinton, and another was of the Pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of Trump, Epstein, and Maxwell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not clear why the files were no longer available. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X on Saturday night, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the DOJ for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Friday - the day the materials were released - that the department had identified more than 1,200 Epstein victims or their relatives, and withheld material that could identify them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many of the documents are also heavily redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DOJ said it would comply with the congressional request to release documents, with some stipulations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It redacted personally identifiable information about Epstein's victims, materials depicting child sexual abuse, materials depicting physical abuse, any records that \"would jeopardise an active federal investigation\" or any classified documents that must stay secret to protect \"national defence or foreign policy\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DOJ said it was \"not redacting the names of any politicians\", and added a quote they attributed to Blanche, saying: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law - full stop. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">John Day, a criminal defence attorney, told the BBC he was surprised by the amount of information that was redacted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is just going to feed the fire if you are a conspiracy theorist,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone anticipated there would be this many redactions.

Many details in the thousands of files have also been heavily redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, at least 13 files were removed from the DOJ website. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche later said it was done to protect victims' privacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of famous faces are included in the first batch of files, including former US President Bill Clinton, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, and musicians Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.

That is a process, he argued, that takes time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking about the files that were removed from the justice department website on Saturday, Blanche told NBC News:\"There were a number of photographs that were pulled down after being released on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's because a judge in New York has ordered us to listen to any victim or victims' rights group if they have concerns.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of when additional materials will be released is unclear, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed frustration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats including Congressman Ro Khanna have threatened action against members of the justice department, including impeachment or possible prosecution over the delay. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khanna led with Republican Congressman Thomas Massie to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act, defying US President Donald Trump who at first urged his party to vote against the measure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The DOJ's document dump of hundreds of thousands of pages failed to comply with the law,\" he said on social media, adding in a video that all options were on the table and were being mulled over by him and Massie. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And this week… I couldn't get in the water. It didn't feel right. It felt sacrilegious in some way,\" Dr Zac Seidler, a local  clinical psychologist and mental health advocate, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the victims of the attack moved here over many decades for safety from persecution, including 87-year-old Holocaust survivor Alex Kleytman. Instead, his life was bookended by violent acts of antisemitic hate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Seidler has spent the past two years trying to convince his grandparents, who are also Holocaust survivors, to hold on to their faltering belief in the good of humanity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[My grandmother] kept saying, 'These are the signs. I've seen this before'. And I just kept saying, 'Not in Australia, not here.

It has ended with mass murder targeting their community.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Jewish Australians on why Bondi is a 'sanctuary' for them</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been resistance in the face of fear - some leaders urging Jewish Australians to double down, be more publicly Jewish and display their religious symbols with pride.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One woman perusing the flowers outside the Bondi Pavilion on Sunday admits she is too scared to do that. It took her all week to even work up the courage to visit this site, which is just metres from where many of the victims died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've never felt my Jewishness before.

Restaurants opened their doors and hid people in their store rooms, and locals ushered lost children into their apartments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even the New South Wales opposition leader Kellie Sloane - also the local state member - was at the scene, helping pack bullet wounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the days after the shooting, thousands of ordinary Australians lined up - many for hours on end - to donate blood desperately needed to treat those injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Each day, a carpet of petals, handwritten notes, commemorative stones and candles grew out from the gates of the Bondi Pavilion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bee motifs - stickers, balloons, even pavement art - are all over the suburb, in remembrance of Matilda, the attack's youngest victim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Surfers and swimmers on Friday paddled out beyond Bondi's iconic breaks to honour those who died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A day later, surf livesavers and lifeguards stood shoulder to shoulder on the beach in solidarity with the Jewish community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But amid the platitudes, sadness and shock is calcifying into anger and tension.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Surfers and swimmers pay tribute to victims of Bondi shooting</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year's Bondi Junction stabbings were devastating for the community - but a shared resolution united it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say the attacker, who had schizophrenia, was in psychosis at the time of the stabbings, and his family have previously said he was frustrated at being unable to find a girlfriend. The question of whether he targeted women will likely forever go unanswered. But clear failures in the mental health system have been identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, families of the victims asked the coroner to refer the doctor who weaned him off medication with limited supervision to regulators for investigation, and they have also argued for a massive boost to mental health service funding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But last Sunday's events raise more uncomfortable feelings and questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is palpable fury at the government, over a perceived – and admitted – failure to do more to stop antisemitism. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been booed during public appearances this week, and talking to people visiting the site of the attack in Bondi, it isn't uncommon to hear them demand his resignation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many people the BBC spoke to pointed to his government's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood, alongside countries including the UK and Canada, and regular protests in Australia by members of the pro-Palestinian movement, which though largely peaceful but have been peppered with antisemitic chants and placards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The state of New South Wales - which has in recent years successively tightened protest rules - has already announced it will introduce more legislation cracking down on \"hateful\" chants and give police more powers to investigate demonstrators. The federal government has promised similar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The blame apportioned to these protests does not sit right with many, even some sections of the Jewish community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to hold multiple truths,\" Dr Seidler says. \"We can be afraid, we can feel that there is deep antisemitic rhetoric going on in certain circles within Australia… while also understanding that there is a right of people in this country – especially Muslim Australians – to be concerned about what is taking place in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to get better at finding that line and calling out when that line has been crossed.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ddd9/live/0d0bb930-debe-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Bouquets and wreaths of flowers in a shopping centre with a Myer sign in the background\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A memorial inside the Bondi Junction Westfield shopping centre where six people were stabbed to death in April last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For others, there is anger at what they feel is the politicisation of a tragedy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a bloody photo op,\" one woman tells me on Sunday, as a prominent Australian businesswoman arrives and begins posing with the floral tributes at Bondi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some - including the local federal MP Allegra Spender - worry the attack is being used to fuel anti-immigration sentiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We would not have had the man who saved so many Australians if we had cut off, for instance, Muslim immigration,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Seidler says these arguments fail to recognise that antisemitic views - and other forms of bigotry - are formed here too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I heard someone say the other day that Australia thinks it's on a holiday from history, that we're somehow immune to this stuff, that it's not bred here, it's imported,\" Dr Seidler says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the anger, there is also fear: for the Jewish community of other attacks, for the Muslim community of retaliation for an act of terror they have loudly condemned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are questions over how Australia's security agency came to drop a 2019 investigation into one of the alleged Bondi Beach suspects, prompting a review into federal police and intelligence agencies that was announced on Sunday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is frustration at NSW Police, who have for years been warned by the Muslim community of hate preachers poaching their young men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is animosity towards the media, driven by hurt among both Jewish and Arab Australians over a belief they have been misrepresented, and frustration at what some feel is incitement against them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is also a queasiness at the treatment of traumatised victims throughout this week, some of whom were interviewed live on television while the blood of their friends still stained their hands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Through it all, is an undercurrent of suspicion of institutions and each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are varying opinions on how those rifts can heal – or even if they can.

It ended with the lighting of the menorah, something the crowds gathered for Hannukah last week never got to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shamash, the centre candle, was lit by the father of Ahmed al Ahmed, in honour of his bravery in wrestling a gun off one of the attackers. The children of the two rabbis who were killed lit another. Others were lit by a representative of surf lifesavers and a Jewish community medic who rushed to the scene and began treating the injured before the shots had even stopped. The final candle was lit by Michael, the father of Matilda, who has been described a fountain of joy to all who knew her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the parade of diverse Australians had sparked flames on each arm of the menorah, Rabbi Yehoram Ulman of Bondi Chabad made a plea for more love and more unity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Returning to normal is not enough,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sydney can and must become a beacon of goodness.

While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Barbara Schwartz (on right) with other volunteers at the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple<b id=\":\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">:</b> If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sammi Cooper is opposed to abortion and protests against the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68580015\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Comstock Act</a>, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

For Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, it is an effective way of attracting tourists outside of the country's main summer season.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The words \"tourism\" and \"Croatia\" are likely to conjure visons of sparkling Adriatic vistas during the hottest months of the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism accounts for more than a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theinternational.si/croatia-tourism-2025-investment-transformation/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">fifth of the economy</a> of this Balkan country, and it is keen to encourage more visitors to arrive outside of the height of summer. Yuletide frolics are a key part of that strategy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're making a transformation,\" says Croatia's Tourism Minister, Tonci Glavina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are developing as a year-round tourism destination – we are not a summer destination anymore. Croatia has really made a significant development. At some point way back it was just sun and sea, but now Croatia offers many tourism products all across the country.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb Advent, as the capital's Christmas markets and events are collectively known, is the poster child for this approach, with billboards in neighbouring countries urging people to attend. In fact, this year the campaign has spread as far as London's tube stations and Milan's buses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are even special trains to bring visitors from Slovenia and Hungary. All of it is part of Zagreb's push, in a very crowded field, to become one of Europe's most popular Christmas markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While some cities might limit their offering to a single location, Zagreb Advent is a multi-venue spectacular that takes over large chunks of the centre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The entire city has become a festive ground for celebrating Christmas throughout the whole of December,\" says Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the Christmas market areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's really special around here is that each of the locations has its own theme, and it's a little bit different in decoration, and in the content that it offers. So for a visitor, I think it's a good deal, because by taking a walk through Zagreb, you can see many different spots.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like other Christmas markets across Europe there are no shortages of the usual seasonal staples, such as sausages and mulled wine. But there are also multiple music stages, craft stalls, vendors offering traditional Croatian food, art installations, and an enormous ice rink.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the market areas, says that Zagreb offers festive variety</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It brings life to Zagreb,\" reckons Zrinka Farina, who is involved with putting on Christmas market events outside the city's historic Hotel Esplanade, as well as a food and music market at nearby Strossmayer Square called Fuliranje – which roughly translates as \"fooling around\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says that Croatians are deadly serious about trying to offer Europe's best Christmas market. \"We are such a sporty nation, we love to compete – and when we do something, we really want to be the best in the world in it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such has been the effort that the city has put into Zagreb Advent since it was first held in 2014 that it was voted the best Christmas market in Europe for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.timeout.com/croatia/news/zagreb-scoops-prize-for-best-christmas-market-in-europe-for-the-third-year-running-121117\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">three years in a row</a>, from 2015 to 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The competition is organised by travel website European Best Destinations, and Zagreb's success has helped to drive visitor numbers to the city every December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in 2014, the city saw 100,198 people stay for at least one night during the last month of the year. By 2024 this had more than doubled to 245,352, which the tourist board says gave the city a €100m ($117m; £88m) economic boost.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zagreb Advent event is spread across the centre of the city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Zagreb has a long way to go if it wishes to catch up with Europe's Christmas market heavyweights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one held in the German city of Cologne is widely reported to be the most popular. It is expected to attract <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://datappeal.io/most-attended-christmas-markets-in-europe-2025/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">four million visitors this year,</a> with an economic impact of €229m.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Austria's capital Vienna attracts around <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visitingvienna.com/sights/christmasmarkets/rathausplatz/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2.8 million visitors</a> to its Christmas market, and France's Strasbourg gets <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.visitstrasbourg.fr/en/discover/the-capital-of-christmas/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">two million people.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb's event also has a limited history – it is only in its 11th year. By contrast, Dresden's Christmas market, widely considered to be the world's oldest, was first held in 1434. Strasbourg's began in 1570, Vienna in 1764 and Cologne in 1820.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its infancy, Zagreb Advent is said to be attracting visitors from across Europe. \"They come here from Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Slovenia and even the UK,\" says Lucija Vrkljan, who is working as a steward at the ice rink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a great place to be,\" says Dario Kozul, the founder of BioMania, a bistro with a stall offering vegan and gluten-free food at the Hotel Esplanade Christmas market.  \"We have a cross-marketing situation all the time,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People walk into this event and test our food – they're really very pleased with it. Then we talk about our restaurant, and within the next couple of days, we see them there.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ffe5/live/41d366c0-d9ca-11f0-be8d-d3af881ba111.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images People at Dresden's Christmas market\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dresden's Christmas market was first held in 1434</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marko Peric, dean of the Faculty of Tourism at Croatia's University of Rijeka, agrees that Zagreb Advent brings \"unusually high\" numbers of arrivals and overnight stays in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he cautions that the rest of Croatia's heavy reliance on the summer season is a weakness that still needs to be addressed. \"We need to work and develop our tourist offer in other parts of the year, including the winter,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have snow, but we can offer a lot. We should rely on our gastronomy, which is well known, with many tourists arriving just because of that. And we could use other types of events like carnival in February, or sporting events.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tourism Minister Tonci Glavina insists that Croatia is making moves in the right direction. He points out that visitor numbers over July and August were actually slightly down on the same period in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the country is still on course for a record-breaking year, thanks to significant growth either side of the summer peak, with around 5% more arrivals in June and September. This, says the minister, is \"just perfect\", as is the 10% year-on-year rise over the first week of December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are transforming Croatia to be a sustainable tourism destination, meaning about the same number of guests in peak season, developing the shoulder seasons, and of course developing other parts of the country to be main tourism destinations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zagreb Advent has already shown the benefits. Although that may not be the first thing that springs to a visitor's mind with all the traditional Croatian treats on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, what could be better than some post-skate fritule doughnuts, except perhaps a fritule with chocolate sauce.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp844kjj37vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Lai was found guilty on all counts</a> of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\".

He was at peace.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/63e5/live/4618a670-dbcb-11f0-bcb7-8fc95bc3292d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Jimmylai.substack.com Jimmy Lai bites an apple with a dozen of arrows into his body in a TV ad for the debut of Apple Daily in 1995\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Jimmylai.substack.com</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Escape from China</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a87/live/ca509490-dc23-11f0-89ae-89110b9e802d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Jimmy Lai, wearing a suit jacket and vest, sits above a grand piano at his home from a picture taken in 1993\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then in 1989, Beijing <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48445934\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square</a>: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then.

He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed.

The Board's Constitution Committee found that they had broken a code of conduct by creating the \"misleading impression that this [the letter] was an official document of the Board as a whole\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for some, the letter represented a watershed moment where some of the conversations about Israel happening in private within the UK's Jewish community could be had in public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Phil Rosenberg argues that there has long been healthy debate among the 300 deputies. His primary concern now is the safety of British Jews but also how the community sees itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a whole range of activities to confront antisemitism,\" he says. \"But we also believe that the community needs not just to be seeing itself, and to be seen, through the prism of pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It already wasn't right that the only public commemoration of Jewish life in this country is Holocaust Memorial Day. And the only compulsory education is Holocaust education. Both of these things are incredibly important, but that's not the whole experience of Jews.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e21d/live/9c659810-d1cd-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PA Media A shot of the back of President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Phil Rosenberg\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">PA Media</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Phil Rosenberg (pictured) says one of his primary concerns is the safety of Jews</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in May 2024 when he first became president of the board, Phil Rosenberg had talked about aiming to celebrate more the contributions made by Jews to British life.

From this temporary refuge, it seems he was then able to travel on to a more secure offer of asylum elsewhere - probably in the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou, or Niamey in Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opacity surrounding Togo's rumoured role in this affair is typical of a country that, under the leadership of Faure Gnassingbé, knows how to extract the maximum diplomatic leverage by defying convention and cultivating relations with a variety of often competing international partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lomé regime is far too shrewd to be caught out openly supporting a challenge to Benin's President Patrice Talon – with whom its relations are guarded at best – or officially confirming the Béninois belief that it secured coup-leader Tigri's passage to safety. Both governments are members of the beleaguered Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Gnassingbé makes no secret of cultivating affable and supportive relations with Burkina Faso and the fellow Sahelian military governments in Niger and Mali – all three of whom walked out of Ecowas last January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor is he afraid of reminding France, Togo's traditional main international partner, that he has other options.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 30 October President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Gnassingbé to the Élysée Palace for talks aimed at strengthening bilateral relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But less than three weeks later, the Togolese leader was in Moscow for a notably warm encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They formally approved a defence partnership allowing Russian vessels to use Lomé port, one of the best-equipped deepwater harbours on the western coast of Africa and a key supply gateway for the landlocked Sahelian states that, following the military coups of 2020 to 2023, have become key Kremlin protégés.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Gnassingbé's trip to Paris was fairly low-key, his Moscow excursion was high-profile and wide-ranging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bilateral military accord provides for intelligence and joint military exercises (although Lomé has no plans to provide a base for the Africa Corps, the Kremlin-controlled successor to the now disbanded Wagner mercenary outfit). All this was supplemented with plans for economic cooperation and an announcement of the reopening of their respective embassies, both closed back in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu via Getty Images Two women in matching wax fabrics.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most people in Togo have only ever known life under the Gnassingbé family</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably all this has unsettled France, for whom Togo was once regarded as among the most devoted of allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lt Col Tigri launched his coup attempt in Benin, Macron was quick to show other Ecowas governments that it was France that could rapidly provide emergency specialist military support for their intervention to protect constitutional order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Togolese insist that their move to strengthen ties with Russia is not a conscious move to break ties with the West. Instead, Lomé presents the move as a natural diversification of relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there is some coherence to this argument.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three years ago Togo and Gabon opted to complement their longstanding participation in the grouping of French-speaking countries, the International Francophonie Organisation (IOF), with membership of the Commonwealth too. Meanwhile, last year English-speaking Ghana, a Commonwealth stalwart, joined the Francophonie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, these days many West African governments become exasperated with the outside world's tendency to view such connections as a choice between a new Cold War alignment or taking sides in a parochial anglophone-francophone competition between former colonial powers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say they want to be friends with a wide range of international partners and see no reason why such relationships should be exclusive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Togo's premier, perhaps more than any other leader in West Africa, has sought to extend this diversified approach to his regional dealings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lomé is a major freight and travel hub whose port can accommodate the largest ocean-going container ships, with feeder vessels distributing transhipped cargo to a range of other smaller or shallower ports that could not do so. From Lomé's airport, local flights fan out across western and central Africa.

It also connects to Gnassingbé's domestic political strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A constitutional change announced in 2024 and implemented this year transformed the presidency – which carries a term limit – into a purely ceremonial role and shifted all executive authority into the post of prime minister, now dubbed \"president of the council\" in a borrowing of Spanish and Italian terminology.  <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgjl9l9z7zjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">This latter post is subject to no term limit</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That allowed Gnassingbé to hand over the presidency to a low-profile regime stalwart and take on the new strong premier role, with little prospect of an end limit on his rule, given the longstanding dominance of his political party, Union for the Republic (UNIR) in successive parliamentary elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was hugely controversial. But protest was rapidly snuffed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ddc1/live/beb89d30-dcfa-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images People in a market in the Togolese capital.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Togo lies at the heart of some of West Africa's major trade routes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Individuals even peripherally connected to demonstrations are in custody. High-profile critics such as the rapper Aamron (real name Narcisse Essiwé Tchalla) or the former defence minister Marguerite Gnakadè – who was married to Gnassingbé's late elder brother – have been threatened with prosecution. Journalists say they have been intimidated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the government have accused protesters of violence. They have warned of \"fake news\" on social media, argued that human rights arguments are being used to destabilise the situation, accusing elements of civil society of fabricating allegations against the security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the words of one minister: \"Effectively it's terrorism when you encourage people to commit unprovoked violence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, the European Parliament approved a resolution demanding the unconditional release of political prisoners, including the Irish-Togolese dual national Abdoul Aziz Goma, who has been in detention since 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Togo's government responded by calling in the EU ambassador to tell him that the country's justice system operated with total independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Through his diverse international strategy, Gnassingbé is seeking to warn off Western critics, signalling that he has choices and options and does not need to cede to Europe, or anyone else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Togo has a history of sudden eruptions of protest or unrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And despite his bullish tone, the new \"president of the council\" may quietly have concluded that it would be wise to afford a gesture of magnanimity, to salve the resentments that still bubble under the surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a state of the nation address earlier this month, he said he would instruct the justice minister to look at possible prisoner releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This hint of retreat from the earlier crackdown shows that even Gnassingbé's nimble international networking cannot defuse the underlying political discontent at home.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img
