class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Antiquity</a>, a peer-reviewed journal of world archaeology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study states: \"Given its exceptional size, density of occupation and architectural complexity, Brusselstown Ring represents a unique case within both the Baltinglass hillfort cluster and more widely within the Atlantic Archipelago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Survey work has been conducted over the last two decades but researchers believed critical questions about \"the date, development and function of both the enclosing elements and the internal settlement remain unanswered\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Therefore, researchers initiated test excavations in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The available evidence indicates their occupation mainly during the Late Bronze Age, with continued use or reuse of some house platforms in the Early Iron Age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This makes Brusselstown Ring the largest nucleated settlement agglomeration by far in prehistoric Ireland and Britain,\" the study highlighted.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What makes it significant?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Brandherm, a reader in prehistoric archaeology at Queen's University Belfast, said the Brusselstown Ring is significant due to \"the large number and the concentration of roundhouses\" in one spot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The image archaeologists had is that during the Bronze Age the settlement structure was based on small hamlets (one to five dwellings) and there were no villages or towns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2002, about 74 roundhouses dating back to the Bronze Age were discovered during the Corrstown excavation in Northern Ireland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researcher said Corrstown was the first village from that era, but the Brusselstown Ring is \"a different ball game altogether\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Brusselstown Ring discovery questions the idea that the first towns on the island of Ireland were founded by the Vikings, according to the researcher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because if you've got more than 600 roundhouses, and potentially a large stone built cistern, that's no longer a village,\" Dr Brandherm told BBC News NI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're talking a proto-town of sorts, and that's 2000 years before the Vikings.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

That is around half of the number of births recorded a decade ago, when China started to ease its rules on how many children people could have. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the tax on contraceptives, including condoms, birth control pills and devices, has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates, as well as ridicule. Some people point out that it would take a lot more than pricey condoms to persuade them to have children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As one retailer urged shoppers to stock up ahead of the price hike, a social media user joked: \"I'll buy a lifetime's worth of condoms now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People can tell the difference between the price of a condom and that of raising a child, wrote another. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is one of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c776xgex02jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">most expensive countries</a> in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing. Costs are pushed up by school fees in a highly competitive academic environment, and the challenge women have juggling work and parenting, the study said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The economic slowdown, partly brought on by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c51nyglznm6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">property crisis that has hit savings</a>, has left families, and especially young people, feeling uncertain or less confident about their future.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have one child, and I don't want any more,\" says 36-year-old Daniel Luo, who lives in the eastern province of Henan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when subway fares increase.

Bulgaria has held seven elections in the past four years - an eighth looks likely early next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't want the euro, and I don't like the way it has been imposed on us,\" Todor, 50, a small business owner in the central town of Gabrovo, at the foot of the Balkan mountains, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there were a referendum, I reckon 70% of the people would vote against it.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A referendum on euro adoption was proposed by President Rumen Radev but rejected by the outgoing government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Todor's business, producing coloured plastics for the domestic market, had a bad  year because of high inflation, he said, and a fall in sales fuelled, he believed, by fear of the euro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ognian Enev, 60, who owns a tea shop in central Sofia, was more enthusiastic. \"On the whole, it's a good thing. It's just a technical change. It doesn't bother me,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any case, he pointed out, people who bought flats or cars until now have got used to prices marked in euros. The 1.2 million Bulgarians who live outside the country have also been sending money home for years in euros.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many shopkeepers, Ognian has the new currency ready, in coins and small denomination notes, ready for the transition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout January, you can pay in both lev and euros, but change is supposed to be in euros. From 1 February, it will no longer be permitted to pay in lev. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He hopes joining the single currency will be good for trade - many of his flavoured and fruit teas come from sellers in the eurozone, while the more expensive, high-end teas are imported direct from China and Japan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since August 2025, all shops in Bulgaria have been required by law to display prices in both currencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conveniently, €1 is worth about two lev (1.95583 to be exact). In response to public fears that prices will be rounded up, elaborate watchdogs have been created, to protect consumers. And some prices have been rounded down: the cost of public transport in the capital Sofia is due to fall slightly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The design on the reverse side of the new eurocoins was chosen to overcome worries that Bulgaria is losing its sovereignty. St Ivan of Rila is on the €1 coin, Paisius of Hilendar, an 18th Century monk and champion of the national revival, is on the €2 coin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The smaller denomination eurocents carry an image of the Madara rider, a symbol of early Bulgarian statehood, based on an 8th Century rock relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just how the new currency will impact Bulgaria as a whole, concerns everyone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lessons from other countries offer two versions - the successful \"Baltic model\" followed by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which combined the euro with reforms to streamline administration, encourage investment and combat corruption. And the \"Italian model\", where years of stagnation followed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm afraid we'll be more like Italy,\" Ognian Enev predicted.</p></div></div></body></html>"

frustrated with older, more established candidates - craved, said Jane Hall, a communications professor at American University who studies politics and the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A candidate does not have to be young to connect with young voters, Hall said, \"but I think you have to be seen as being authentic and speaking to what people care about in a way that is hip and makes people want to be on the bandwagon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jack Bratich, a journalism professor at Rutgers University who studies political culture and social media, said Mamdani has shown he is able to combine a lightheartedness with serious conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sense of fun stands in contrast to some of the negativity that President Donald Trump has leaned into on social media, Jennifer Stromer-Galley, who teaches communications, political science, and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media in the Oval Office\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The pair had a warm first meeting at the White House in November</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqd42gl0qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">unexpectedly friendly first meeting</a> in November between the two politicians, where they said they agreed on a number of issues facing New York City, such as the affordability crisis, the pair locked horns during the mayoral race. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump painted Mamdani as an extremist \"lunatic\", threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won, and said he would have him arrested if he stood in the way of immigration enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On election night, Mamdani snapped back in his victory speech, telling the president \"to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That comment prompted a raucous cheer from his supporters at the time, but experts say the reality of governing may mean engaging with the Trump administration in a pragmatic way. That warm meeting in November may have been an early sign that Mamdani is willing to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How he works with the White House - and the kind of relationship he cultivates with the president - could prove crucial for implementing his agenda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it may be easy to promise \"fast, sweeping change\" in campaign videos, things become much more difficult when it comes to actually \"governing under a hostile administration\", said Ioana Literat, a Columbia University communications professor who studies youth online political socialisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If his [social media] content doesn't reckon honestly with those constraints, the same young people who made him go viral can just as quickly turn that energy into disillusionment or backlash,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zohran Mamdani: From immigrant roots to mayor of New York City</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To succeed in office Mamdani will need to keep his supporters engaged with day-to-day governing - and that is not as thrilling as a high-stakes political race, Jonathan Nagler, co-director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's easy to mobilise people to oppose Trump. They already disagree with Trump on so many things, if we're talking about New York City voters,\" Nagler said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's much harder to do is to go on social media and say: \"Hey, the New York City Council is in my way. I need you to get riled up about convincing the New York City Council to do something\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nagler added that it could be a challenge to educate some of those voters about how city government works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Like all election campaigns, the transition to governance via media is tricky,\" Rutgers Prof Bratich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One strategy for keeping the momentum of his campaign could be to turn his captive social media followers into active grassroots organisers. After all, social media \"was the front door into a huge field operation and youth volunteer corps\" for the mayor-elect, Braitch said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's posts during the campaign consistently directed followers toward protests, canvassing events, registration drives, and other forms of active participation - ultimately producing more than 100,000 volunteers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if his administration stumbles and the feeds keep promising more than he can deliver, it could harden a sense among young voters that 'even the internet's mayor couldn't change anything,'\" Literat said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That broader reputational risk is part of what makes his governing-era social media so consequential,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is at least one major sign that that the grassroots momentum surrounding Mamdani will continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, his allies announced a new advocacy group that aims to use his deep well of volunteers to raise funds for his agenda. The nonprofit, Our Time for an Affordable NYC, was founded by Mamdani volunteers and members of the Democratic Socialists of New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Our Time is legally separate from Mamdani and his transition team, the group says it is focused on pushing forward the mayor-elect's affordability agenda through \"door-knocking, phone-banking, communicating, and organising at the neighbourhood, city, and state level\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's swearing-in ceremony on Thursday took place inside the original City Hall subway station, which is now abandoned for regular transit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,\" he said. \"I cannot wait to see everyone tomorrow as we begin our term.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Most have been taken to Valais hospital where the intensive care unit is now full, according to local authorities.

But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine.

Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU.

Black-browed albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird-scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird-scaring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird-scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird-scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird-scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, he became Pope in 2013. He took Francis as his papal name in honour of St Francis of Assisi, a saint who renounced his wealth and lived among the poor. From his election onwards, he turned down many privileges traditionally accorded to the Pope.
