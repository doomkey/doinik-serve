This includes 27 hostages who are believed to be dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the videos were released, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with the two hostage families, expressing \"profound shock\" and telling them that efforts to return all the hostages \"will continue constantly and relentlessly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Sunday, Netanyahu spoke to the head of the Red Cross in the region, requesting his immediate involvement in providing food and medical care to hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it was \"appalled\" by the videos that gave \"stark evidence of the life-threatening conditions in which the hostages are being held\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The charity reiterated its call to be granted access to the hostages to assess their condition, give them medical support and facilitate contact with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas's armed wing Al-Qassam Brigades said it would respond positively to any Red Cross request to deliver food and medicine to prisoners if humanitarian corridors were opened into Gaza on a regular and permanent basis, and air strikes halted during the time of receiving aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Red Cross has faced heavy criticism in Israel over its role in the war, with claims that it has failed to help the hostages being held in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, amid anger over chaotic scenes as hostages were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas, the organisation explained the limits of its role, saying it relies on the warring parties' goodwill to operate in conflict zones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has also been criticism from Palestinians, as the group has not been allowed to visit Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails since 7 October 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the weekend in Tel Aviv, crowds of protesters and hostage families gathered once again, calling on the Israeli government to secure the release of hostages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">David and Braslavski's families said at a rally on Saturday that \"everyone must get out of hell, now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In one video, Braslavski is seen crying as he says he has run out of food and water and only ate three \"crumbs of falafels\" that day. He says he is unable to stand or walk, and \"is at death's door\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Braslavski's family in a statement said \"they managed to break Rom\" and pleaded to Israeli and US leaders to bring their son home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has simply been forgotten there,\" they said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/659a/live/7b674890-70a0-11f0-89f0-dfcf39588021.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Other Rom Braslavski lies on the ground, only his head visible, crying\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Other</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A still of a video released by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad showing Rom Braslavski </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the second video, David said \"I haven't eaten for days...

Israel denies the allegation and blames Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite the overwhelming evidence, Israeli authorities, and part of the country's press, strongly reject that there is starvation in Gaza, and say the crisis is a lie fabricated by Hamas and spread by international media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some pictures of emaciated children have been displayed by Israeli protesters calling for a deal with Hamas, but many in Israel seem unaware of the extent of the emergency there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the war continues, Israel faces growing international isolation, as the widespread destruction in Gaza and the suffering of Palestinians spark outrage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Polls around the world suggest that public opinion is increasingly negative about Israel, which is putting pressure on leaders to act.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Nor the defence ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And I've seen no announcement about Russian nuclear submarines being positioned closer to America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Which suggests that either Moscow is still studying the situation and working out what to do, or that Moscow doesn't feel the need to react.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Russian press reaction I mentioned earlier suggests it's the latter.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump had been sparring with Medvedev on social media for several days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the US president had reduced his 50-day deadline for Russia to end its war in Ukraine to less than two weeks, Medvedev posted that Trump was \"playing the ultimatum game with Russia…Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump responded: \"Tell Medvedev, the failed former Russian president who thinks he is still in power, to be careful what he says. He is entering very dangerous territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Medvedev's next post contained a reference to \"Dead Hand\", the automatic nuclear retaliation system developed in the Soviet Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Clearly, that did not go down well with the White House chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When he was Russia's president, between 2008 and 2012, Medvedev was seen as a relatively liberal figure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Freedom is better than no freedom\" he was famously quoted as saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he has grown increasingly hawkish. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine he has gained a reputation for bombastic, anti-Western social media posts. Most of them have passed unnoticed, since he is not viewed as the voice of the Kremlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Suddenly he has been noticed: by the President of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And not just noticed. He's got right under Trump's skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's one thing to dislike a social media post. We've all been there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But to dislike it so much you deploy nuclear submarines feels like overkill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So why has Trump done it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here's Trump's own explanation from his interview with Newsmax: \"Medvedev said some things that are very bad, talking about nuclear. When you mention the word nuclear my eyes light up and I say we better be careful, because it's the ultimate threat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Medvedev has long been accused of nuclear sabre-rattling via social media. It's nothing new.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What is clear is that Trump took the recent Medvedev posts very personally, and reacted accordingly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Might there also be a strategy at play? Unpredictability feels like a big part of Trump's way of doing things, in business and in politics; taking unexpected decisions that can put rivals and opponents off balance before talks or during a negotiation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On ending the war in Ukraine, for example.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Surprise submarine deployments may well fall into that category.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was the largest downward revision in employment figures - apart from the Covid-era - since 1979. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not unusual for the BLS to amend jobs figures as more data comes to light, however. During Joe Biden's presidency, statistics for 12 months over 2023-4 were retroactively revised downward by 818,000 jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Though this month's changes were much larger than usual, analysts said the updates were consistent with other data showing slowdown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president posted on Truth Social on Friday: \"The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said the job figures were a \"gamechanger\", adding that \"the labor market is deteriorating quickly\" because of uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president has dismissed concerns about his tariff plans, which he says will boost manufacturing in the US and rebalance global trade. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But data this week and a string of updates from companies on tariff costs have made those forecasts harder to ignore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the decision to sack McEntarfer, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said: \"Firing the head of a key government agency because you don't like the numbers they report, which come from surveys using long established procedures, is what happens in authoritarian countries, not democratic ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Friends of BLS, a group whose members include two former commissioners of the agency, said: \"When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">McEntarfer called her time as commissioner \"the honour of my life\", while describing the agency's work as \"vital and important\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Leading US stock market indices all closed sharply lower on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has attacked key economic figures in the past, most recently Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, as the central bank continues to leave interest rates unchanged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump is demanding a cut, but the Fed is holding fire until it sees the full impact of tariffs on the US economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the aftermath of the jobs report, Trump launched a further salvo at Powell, stating he should also be put \"out to pasture\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, Adriana Kugler, is resigning early giving Trump an opportunity to install someone new. Her term was due to end next January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The head of the Labour Department, which oversees the BLS, wrote on social media that the agency's deputy commissioner William Wiatrowski would step into the role during the search for a replacement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Labour Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts speculated that the jobs data could reflect a hit to small businesses, which are typically slower to respond to surveys and are especially vulnerable to tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">McEntarfer worked for the government for more than 20 years before being nominated by Biden to lead the BLS in 2023. She was later confirmed near unanimously by the US Senate, including by current Vice-President JD Vance, who was then an Ohio senator. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, defended Entarfer, saying she had conducted herself with \"great integrity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is imperative that decisionmakers understand that government statistics are unbiased and of the highest quality. By casting doubt on that, the President is damaging the United States,\" he wrote on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the firing raised serious alarm. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For six months, I've said that threats to economic data have been more collateral damage than intentional harm. No longer. Firing the head of the BLS is five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system,\" he wrote on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump defended the decision and said her departure was needed to ensure there were \"people that we can trust\" in these posts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Why should anybody trust numbers?\" the president told reporters when leaving the White House on Friday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I believe the numbers were phony, just like they were before the election, and there were other times - so you know what I did? I fired her, and you know what I did? The right thing.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Tariffs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fight over data comes as Trump remakes trade policy, hitting goods from countries around the world with new tariffs ranging from 10% to 50%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Trump put forward similar plans in April, shares in the US tumbled more than 10% in a week as concerns spread to the dollar and bond markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The stock market recovered after he suspended some of the most drastic measures, leaving in place a less punishing, more expected 10% levy. In recent weeks, indexes in the US have been trading around all-time highs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest measures are less extreme than what Trump first put forward in April, but they will still push the average tariff rate to roughly 17%, up from less than 2.5% at the start of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The reality is Trump got emboldened by the fact that markets came right back,\" Michael Gayed, a portfolio manager for The Free Markets ETF, told the BBC's Opening Bell. \"Now he's going to try his luck again.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Faith, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, had dutifully laughed along at the bad jokes made by her bosses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But then a senior colleague made a suggestion that she felt would not work practically. But before Faith could express her opinion, her colleague mentioned her name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"And Faith agrees with me!\" The others in the meeting room turned to face her as her colleague added: \"You agree, don't you?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Faith did not agree, but felt under pressure: \"I didn't want to be seen as difficult or moody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I felt an unspoken pressure to smile, to be agreeable, to not be disruptive,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At that point she was two years into her first job at a sought-after company and among the first women in her family's generation to go to university - she had so much more she wanted to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"How do I progress if I start disagreeing with colleagues at such a junior stage?\" she asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Faith is aware she faces what a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/social-sector/our-insights/women-in-the-workplace-2025-india-nigeria-and-kenya\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Women in the Workplace 2025 report</a>, which focuses on India, Nigeria and Kenya, calls \"the broken rung\". This refers to a significant barrier on the corporate ladder that has seen a steep drop in women's representation between entry-level and management roles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Published in May by McKinsey, the management consultancy has for the first time expanded its annual research beyond North America and found that in these three big developing economies, women remain significantly underrepresented in senior leadership positions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Kenya, women make up 50% of entry-level roles in sectors such as healthcare and financial services, but that drops to just 26% at senior levels. The pattern is similar in Nigeria and India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Faith did not challenge her colleague in the meeting. She smiled and said nothing.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is now a term for her experience - experts call it \"likeability labour\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[This] is a really fun name for an incredibly depressing reality,\" says Amy Kean, a sociologist and head of the communications consultancy Good Shout, which coined the term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It refers to the constant second-guessing, overthinking, paranoia, shape-shifting and masking women do every single day in order to be liked in the workplace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Kean's UK-based study - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/629df00e2c776f10a099aa15/t/681c9d398a172e664aa6c973/1746705736757/Shapeshifters++What+We+Do+to+Be+Liked+at+Work.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Shapeshifters: What We Do to Be Liked at Work</a> - which also came out in May, states that 56% of women feel pressure to be likeable at work, compared to just 36% of men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Based on a survey of 1,000 women across the UK, the report also highlights how deeply ingrained, and unequally distributed, the burden of likeability is in professional environments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It details how women often feel the need to soften their speech using minimising language, even when confident in their point.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Common phrases include: \"Does that make sense?\" or \"Sorry, just quickly...\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This kind of constant self-editing, Ms Kean explains, may act as a defence mechanism to avoid being seen as abrasive or overly assertive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is also a class element to this,\" she adds, in reference to the UK. \"Working-class women, who are less used to modulating themselves in different settings, also get accused of being direct and also suffer in the corporate world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For many women who are not used to advocating for themselves in their personal environments, the stakes go beyond fitting in or being well-liked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's not as simple as being popular, it's about being safe, heard and taken seriously,\" Ms Kean adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, she organised a summit in London for women feeling the likeability labour pressure, titled Unlikeable Woman. More than 300 women turned up to share their experiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK study is not an outlier.

Analysing data from 25,000 individuals across 253 organisations, it found that women were much more likely to receive personality-based feedback and that 56% of women had been labelled \"unlikeable\" in performance reviews, a critique only 16% of men received.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Men, on the other hand, were four times more likely than other genders to be positively labelled as \"likeable\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Women perform likeability labour for a mix of social and cultural reasons,\" says Dr Gladys Nyachieo, a sociologist and senior lecturer at the Multimedia University of Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Women are generally socialised to be caregivers, to serve and to put the needs of others before themselves and this invariably transfers to the workplace,\" says Dr Nyachieo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is a term for it in Kiswahili - 'office mathe' - or the office mother.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The office mathe does additional labour to keep a workplace functioning, including making tea, buying snacks and generally being of service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I ask what is wrong with this if that is what a woman wants to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's nothing wrong with it,\" Dr Nyachieo says. \"But you won't get paid for it. You will still be expected to do your work, and possibly additional work.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Nyachieo believes that in order to tackle likeability labour, systemic change has to happen at the root, including implementing policies that allow women flexible hours and have mentors that advocate for them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She herself mentors several young women just starting out in Kenya's workforces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I take mentoring young women very seriously,\" Dr Nyachieo says. \"I tell them: 'If you act pleasantly all the time, you will go nowhere.

Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word \"heimat\" is hugely important in Switzerland. \"Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's a much bigger word than home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak Leetschär, the dialect they all still dream in.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Imogen Foulkes Traditional wooden masks called Tschaeggaetta, which are unique to the valley.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Imogen Foulkes</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Traditional wooden masks called Tschäggättä are unique to that valley</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the Tschäggättä, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan.

South Korean serums are better-suited for her skin compared to some Western brands that tend to be more harsh, the 27-year-old graphic designer says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now \"95% of my skincare is made up of K-beauty products\", she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Mak is not alone in her preference for South Korean skincare brands. Americans spent as much $1.7bn (£1.3bn) on K-beauty products in 2024, according to industry estimates. That marks a more than 50% rise compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">K-beauty products are often more attractively priced than their Western counterparts - but also feature ingredients that are not as commonly found in the West - from heartleaf to snail mucin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US President Donald Trump has now imposed a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpvl9krxwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">15% import tax on South Korean goods</a> traded between Seoul and Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's less than the 25% levy that Trump had threatened, but many consumers are not taking any chances. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US K-beauty retailer Santé Brand saw orders spike by nearly 30% in April, right after Trump unveiled sweeping US import taxes on most of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the tariff announcements hit, customers got strategic with how they were going to weather the storm,\" Santé Brand's founder Cheyenne Ware told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Consumers are preparing against the uncertainty.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another K-beauty retailer, Senti Senti, has been ordering more products since Trump started his tariff threats, says manager Winnie Zhong. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This week, she received alerts from suppliers urging retailers to \"stock up before tariffs\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both retailers said prices of K-beauty products are likely to increase as the levies push up costs across the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Anyone telling you prices will stay flat through the next two years is naive,\" says Ms Ware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prices are bound to rise, especially for smaller sellers of beauty products on platforms like Amazon, who operate with slim profit margins, economist Munseob Lee from the University of California San Diego says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite higher prices, the global popularity of South Korean culture means K-beauty products are likely to remain in demand in the US, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Casual buyers might be turned off by the higher price, but fans won't find an easy substitute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Zhong agrees. She thinks customers will still want to buy K-beauty products but price rises may mean they purchase fewer items than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Higher prices are unlikely to stop Ms Mak buying her favourite products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It depends on how much the price shoots up, but as of now, I am willing to pay more to purchase the same products,\" she says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'No easy substitute'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Big K-beauty brands are in a much better position to absorb the cost of tariffs than their smaller rivals, says South Korea-based business consultant Eyal Victor Mamou.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These larger companies will be able to avoid major price rises for their customers as they have higher profit margins, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But smaller K-beauty firms that make their products in South Korea will struggle to keep a lid on costs, Mr Mamou adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will take some time to take effect since most goods being sold in the short-run have already been commissioned at current prices, but we'll see it play out soon.\" </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4563/live/da980690-6ea9-11f0-a8f2-eba5f5937655.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A customer browses cosmetics at an Etude House store in the Lotte Mall Gimpo Airport, operated by Lotte Asset Development Co, in Seoul, South Korea.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The global appeal of K-beauty products has been driven by the popularity of South Korean culture</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, President Trump has struck deals with Japan and the European Union that will see their exports to the US subject to the same 15% tariffs as South Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That means countries that are home to some of the world's biggest cosmetics brands face the same levies as the K-beauty industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Central to Trump's trade policies is his ambition to see more goods being made in America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it's yet to be seen whether or not this will mean US buyers switch to American beauty products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Mak says she doesn't see US-made products as attractive alternatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I do search for American-made alternatives often, but I have yet to find any that are  as effective as the ones I use.

But the sound of the drones has followed him. Everyday mechanical tools like lawnmowers, motorcycles and air conditioners remind him of the FPVs that hunted him and his unit mates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And nature is not an escape. Pavlo can no longer hear the sound of bees and flies buzzing near him without a creeping panic. \"I don't like to go into nature anymore and hear this sound, because it reminds me so hard of the drones,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trauma associated with sound is not new – generations of soldiers have been affected by sudden noises after returning to civilian life. But as the war in Ukraine has evolved into a conflict driven by drone technology, the trauma has evolved with it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Over the past year, the majority of patients – if they are not physically wounded – have mental health injuries as a result of being under drone activity,\" said Dr Serhii Andriichenko, chief psychiatrist at Kyiv's military hospital. \"We call this droneophobia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many thousands of men are now returning from the front like Pavlo, with acute stress disorders associated with the sounds of drones, Dr Andriichenko said. The droneophobia can be triggered by an array of ordinary urban sounds – small motorcycles and scooters, lawnmowers, air conditioners – anything mechanical that whirrs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If it's a moped or a lawnmower, my first thought is that it might be a drone,\" said another returned frontline soldier, Savur, who lost his arm in an FPV drone attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the front line the drones were a \"permanent sound\", said Savur, who in accordance with military protocol asked to be identified by his callsign. \"The sound of a shell lasts just a few seconds, but the sound of the drone is there most of the time,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can lay in your position, in your foxhole, and listen to it for hours. I remember that sound all of the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Or sometimes the problem was the opposite – silence. \"Silence is always the start,\" Dr Andriichenko, the psychiatrist, said. \"When the soldiers go on rotation to combat positions, they start listening carefully to make sure there are no drones. There is constant tension, constant fear. They are always looking up.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Serhii Andriichenko, chief psychiatrist at Kyiv's military hospital. \"We call this droneophobia,\" he said.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In many cases, that constant sense of tension has not been dispelled by the return to civilian life. Soldiers have been observed suddenly switching off lights at home, moving away from windows and hiding under furniture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later, if a soldier is seen for treatment, Dr Andriichenko describes how he often has no memory of any trigger sound, but his wife or family member will reveal that an extractor fan or air conditioner had just been turned on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soldiers from the earlier phases of the war - which was characterised more by brutal, direct combat - came home fearful of being in forests, where much of the fighting had taken place. But drone warfare has reversed the phenomenon. Now soldiers \"feel safest in forests, under dense tree canopies\", the psychiatrist said. \"And in their free time, they try to avoid wooded areas.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rise in drone use has had another terrorising effect for combat troops - it has extended the danger zone far back from the front line. Soldiers operating up to 40km (25 miles) away, or pulling back after a heavy rotation, can no longer let their guard down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nazar Bokhii, a commander of a small drone unit, was about 5km from the contact line in a dugout one day when his unit scored a direct hit on a Russian mortar position 22km away. Buoyed by the success, Bokhii bounded out of the dugout, forgetting the usual protocol of stopping first to listen for a telltale buzz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Metres away, a Russian FPV was loitering in the air. As it sped towards him, Bokhii only had time to raise his arms. When it detonated, it took both his hands and his left eye and badly burned his face.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Nazar Bokhii lost both his hands and one eye in a Russian FPV drone attack</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bokhii's own PTSD was limited, he said, to an occasional fear response to motorcycles and lawnmowers. But he knew about the effect of the sound, he said, because his unit had used it to inflict terror on others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were the side that caused fear with sound, not the side that suffered from it,\" Bokhii said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They had realised at some point that the sound could be used to force Russian soldiers into exposed areas. \"You buzz around them and it becomes a test of the enemy's psychological resilience,\" Bokhii said. \"The sound of the drone itself is a serious psychological attack.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Bokhii, buzz above a soldier for long enough and he will leave a strong shelter and simply run into open terrain. \"Our psychology works in such a way that we need to do something to calm ourselves,\" Bokhii said. \"So you hover nearby and psychologically suppress him… and he starts running and becomes easier to hit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And the psychological terror of the FPV is no longer just a problem on the front line. It has reached beyond even the areas behind the front lines. Russia has begun using FPVs to drop munitions on civilians in Ukrainian cities nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among the worst hit is Kherson, a southern city occupied for a time by Russian forces and still comfortably within drone range. According to Human Rights Watch, Russian forces have deliberately targeted civilians in the city with FPV drones and killed or maimed them - a war crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the regional military administration, at least 84 civilians have been killed in the Kherson region as a result of Russian drone attacks so far this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Residents say the tiny FPVs are a daily terror.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no such thing as a safe place anymore,\" said Dmytro Olifirenko, a 23-year-old border guard who lives in Kherson city. \"You always have to be alert, focused, and because of that, the body is constantly under stress,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Stanislav Ostrous/BBC Dmytro Olifirenko wears a dark T-shirt with a scrawled logo in white and a tattoo partially showing on one arm\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Stanislav Ostrous/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Dmytro Olifirenko is among the many civilians wounded in drone attacks in Kherson. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Olifirenko was waiting at a bus stop in September when he heard the familiar sound of a Russian drone overhead. \"We thought it would follow the bus, because they had been hunting civilian buses,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, the drone simply dropped its munition on the bus stop, sending shrapnel into Olifirenko's head, face and leg. Video of the incident, filmed by a bystander, captured the buzz of the drone followed by Olifirenko's screams as he bled onto the pavement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Olifirenko now heard the drones \"constantly\", he said, whether they were there or not. \"It hits your mental and psychological health hard,\" he said. \"Even when you leave for Mykolaiv or another city, you are constantly trying to listen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For civilians like Oliferenko, the drones have transformed the ordinary sounds of a populated area – cars, motorcycles, generators, lawnmowers, air conditioners – into a psychological gauntlet for civilians to run every day, even as they contend with the real danger of the drones themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the soldiers coming back from the front, like Pavlo, the drones have created a new and specific type of fear, one that is not easy to shake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You see the world as a battlefield,\" Pavlo said. \"It can become a battlefield any second.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And of all the triggers, hearing - the human sense drones are exploiting so effectively - was the most insidious, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When you see something, your brain can check it in a second, you can realise what it is very fast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But an unknown sound is different.

It was part of a vast undercover scheme to raise funds for North Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Juggling multiple jobs across the US and Europe would make him at least $5,000 (£3,750) a month, he told the BBC in a rare interview. Some colleagues, he said, would earn much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before he defected, Jin-su - whose name has been changed to protect his identity - was one of thousands believed to have been sent abroad to China and Russia, or countries in Africa and elsewhere, to take part in the shadowy operation run by secretive North Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">North Korean IT workers are closely monitored and few have spoken to the media, but Jin-su has provided extensive testimony to the BBC, giving a revealing insight into what daily life is like for those working the scam, and how they operate. His first-hand account confirms much of what has been estimated in UN and cyber security reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said 85% of what he earned was sent back to fund the regime. Cash-strapped North Korea has been under international sanctions for years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We know it's like robbery, but we just accept it as our fate,\" Jin-su said, \"it's still much better than when we were in North Korea.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Secret IT workers generate $250m-$600m annually for North Korea, according to a UN Security Council report published in March 2024. The scheme boomed in the pandemic, when remote working became commonplace, and has been on the rise ever since, authorities and cyber defenders warn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most workers are after a steady paycheck to send back to the regime, but in some cases, they have stolen data or hacked their employers and demanded ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdnz3elwzvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">a US court indicted 14 North Koreans</a> who allegedly earned $88m by working in disguise and extorting US firms over a six-year period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Four more North Koreans who allegedly used fraudulent identities to secure remote IT work for a cryptocurrency firm in the US were indicted last month.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Getting the jobs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su was an IT worker for the regime in China for several years before defecting. He and his colleagues would mostly work in teams of 10, he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Access to the internet is limited in North Korea, but abroad, these IT workers can operate more easily. They need to disguise their nationality not just because they can get paid more by impersonating Westerners, but due to the extensive international sanctions North Korea is under, primarily in response to its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This scheme is separate from North Korea's hacking operations which also raise money for the regime. Earlier this year the Lazarus Group - an infamous hacking group understood to be working for North Korea, though they've never admitted to it - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2kgndwwd7lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">is thought to have stolen $1.5bn (£1.1bn) from cryptocurrency firm Bybit</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The BBC spoke to Jin-su on a video call from London. For his safety we are protecting his identity.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su spent most of his time trying to secure fraudulent identities which he could use to apply for jobs. He would first pose as Chinese, and contact people in Hungary, Turkey and other countries to ask them to use their identity in exchange for a percentage of his earnings, he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you put an 'Asian face' on that profile, you'll never get a job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He would then use those borrowed identities to approach people in Western Europe for their identities, which he'd use to apply for jobs in the US and Europe. Jin-su often found success targeting UK citizens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"With a little bit of chat, people in the UK passed on their identities so easily,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">IT workers who speak better English sometimes handle the applications process. But jobs on freelancer sites also don't necessarily require face-to-face interviews, and often day-to-day interactions take place on platforms like Slack, making it easier to pretend to be someone you are not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su told the BBC he mostly targeted the US market, \"because the salaries are higher in American companies\". He claimed so many IT workers were finding jobs, often companies would unwittingly hire more than one North Korean. \"It happens a lot,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's understood that IT workers collect their earnings through networks of facilitators based in the West and China. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2l2yn5zmxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Last week a US woman was sentenced to more than eight years in prison</a> for crimes connected to assisting North Korean IT workers find jobs and sending them money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC cannot independently verify the specifics of Jin-su's testimony, but through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pscore.org/life-north-korea/free-resources/?ckattempt=1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">PSCORE</a>, an organisation which advocates for North Korean human rights, we've read testimony from another IT worker who defected that supports Jin-su's claims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC also spoke to a different defector, Hyun-Seung Lee, who met North Koreans working in IT while he was travelling as a businessman for the regime in China. He confirmed they'd had similar experiences.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A growing problem</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC spoke to multiple hiring managers in the cyber security and software development sector who say they've spotted dozens of candidates they suspect are North Korean IT workers during their hiring processes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rob Henley, co-founder of Ally Security in the US, was recently hiring for a series of remote vacancies at his firm, and believes he interviewed up to 30 North Korean IT workers in the process. \"Initially it was like a game to some extent, like trying to figure out who was real and who was fake, but it got pretty annoying pretty quickly,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Eventually, he resorted to asking candidates on video calls to show him it was daytime where they were. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were only hiring candidates from the US for these positions. It should have been at least light outside. But I never saw daylight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in March, Dawid Moczadło, co-founder of Vidoc Security Lab based in Poland, shared a video of a remote job interview he conducted where the candidate appeared to be using artificial intelligence software to disguise their face. He said that after speaking to experts, he believed the candidate could be a North Korean IT worker.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Get Real Security - a digital forensics company - told us it's highly likely the candidate (left) is using some kind of faceswapping or AI filter</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We contacted the North Korean embassy in London to put the allegations in this story to them. They did not respond.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A rare escape route</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">North Korea has been sending its workers abroad for decades to earn the state foreign currency. Up to 100,000 are employed abroad as factory or restaurant workers, mostly in China and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After several years of living in China, Jin-su said the \"sense of confinement\" over his oppressive working conditions built up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We weren't allowed to go out and had to stay indoors all the time\" he said. \"You can't exercise, you can't do what you want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, North Korean IT workers have more freedom to access Western media when they're abroad, Jin-su said. \"You see the real world. When we are abroad, we realise that something is wrong inside North Korea.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But despite this, Jin-su claimed few North Korean IT workers thought about escaping like he did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They just take the money and go back home, very few people would think about defection.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although they only keep a small proportion of what they earn, it's worth a lot in North Korea. Defecting is also hugely risky and difficult. Surveillance in China means most are caught. Those few who do succeed in defecting may never see their families again, and their relatives could face punishment for them leaving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su is still working in IT now he's defected. He says the skills he honed working for the regime have helped him settle into his new life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Because he isn't working multiple jobs with fake IDs, he earns less than when he worked for the North Korean regime. But because he can keep more of his earnings, overall, he has more money in his own pocket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I had got used to making money by doing illegal things. But now I work hard and earn the money I deserve.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East.

But authorities have issued warnings about the kites, which they say pose a safety hazard if they block aircraft sensors or get snagged in engines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During three days in early July, kites disrupted 21 flights at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, the one near the paddy field, according to air-traffic controller AirNav Indonesia. Some had been diverted to another airport and some aborted landings, deeming it too dangerous to go near the kites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kites are \"moving obstacles\" for planes and a \"serious risk to flight safety\", Putu Eka Cahyadi, head of the Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Authority, tells the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't want accidents to occur.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aa1f/live/38157190-6dab-11f0-8613-1d712cf2c4d7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Haryo Bangun Wirawan/BBC Back view of a group of children and teens looking at the sky, as they fly kites in a field\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Haryo Bangun Wirawan/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Children have continued to fly kites at a field near the airport, despite warnings from authorities</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such fears are not unfounded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July 2024, a helicopter crashed in Bali after it got entangled in kite strings, injuring three Indonesians and two Australians on board.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July 2020, strings and bamboo sticks from a kite were found in the engine of a plane after it arrived at Soekarno-Hatta. While the plane had managed to land without mishap, the incident triggered serious safety concerns. The following month, the airport set up a task force to crack down on kite-flying near its premises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five years on, the problem has persisted. In July, transport minister Dudy Purwagandhi urged airport authorities and regional governments across Indonesia to minimise the harm that kites are posing to flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's certainly a fun activity, but we also need to educate them to prevent the public or children from engaging in activities that could endanger flights,\" says Mr Putu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His colleagues have tried giving the kids footballs and badminton racquets to steer them towards other sports. But kite-flying is woven into the fabric of Indonesian culture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Traditionally made with leaves, colourful paper or cloth, kites are flown in Indonesia for various purposes: for rice harvest ceremonies, to chase birds away from crops or, in Bali, as a form of prayer and offering to the gods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Kite flying has been passed down through generations from our ancestors. Almost every region in Indonesia has a tradition of kite flying,\" says Asep Irawan, an expert from the Indonesia Kite Museum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"However, we need to be cautious, especially [with] children.

In densely populated areas, kites are also a deadly distraction. Last year, an eight-year-old boy died after venturing onto a toll road in Depok city, south of Jakarta. Police believe he was hit by a car while chasing a kite.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2020, a man was arrested after his kite broke and fell onto a substation in Bali, causing hours of blackout in more than 70,000 houses and buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back on the paddy field near Soekarno-Hatta Airport, the children say they don't mean to mess with the planes - but they are hard-pressed to find better places for their hobby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jakarta lost 31% of its urban green spaces between 2000 and 2020, as fields and forests gave way to congested roads and apartment blocks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's nowhere else around here,\" says Rasha, a 17-year-old who makes and sells kites. \"There's one other spot, but it's still close to the airport.
