Its leader, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, described Mr Trump's rhetoric as \"not constructive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island's representative to the US has said that the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent poll suggests that most Americans also oppose US control of Greenland.

Gina and her fiance made for the nearest exit, a door to the right of the club's small stage. A bouncer blocked their way, but Gina has no idea why.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's when \"a stampede\" began for the main exit, she says, and Fred desperately pushed her ahead in the crowd. Gina says \"bodies were piling up\" as people scrambled to get out - and her last memory was making it through the door to safety before passing out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When she woke from an induced coma 11 weeks later, Gina learned her fiance had saved her life but had lost his in the fire.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fred Crisostomi and Gina Russo, pictured in 2002.

At The Station nightclub, 100 people died and at Le Constellation, 40, mainly young people, lost their lives. Many survivors of both fires have severe burn injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two disasters have striking similarities, and not only in their appalling impact on victims. Both were caused by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgezqvwr54no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">indoor pyrotechnics</a>, experts say. Victims appear to have had little time to find an escape route, and foam panels may have spread the Swiss fire in an identical way to The Station nightclub fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UK fire investigation consultant Richard Hagger was quick to compare the two tragedies. He is \"99% certain\" the Swiss fire was triggered by the sparklers. He says if the foam had been fire retardant it would have smouldered, not burned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These similarities raise the questions: do we really understand how dangerous such situations are? And what should we do if we find ourselves caught up in one?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A matter of seconds to escape</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In both the Rhode Island and Swiss tragedies, a \"flashover fire\" is thought to have taken hold. This is when hot air rises, but as the heat and smoke reach the ceiling there is nowhere for it to go. So it spreads downwards, quickly igniting furniture, clothes and skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2003, Phil Barr was 22, back home in Rhode Island for a winter break while studying in Maine. He was set on a career on Wall Street, but Phil loved a loud rock band, so going to see Great White that night sounded, well, great.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He got there early and when his friend arrived shortly before show time, Phil grabbed him a beer and excitedly propelled him to the front of the crowd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the fire began, the band's lead singer turned and said, calmly over the PA system: \"Wow, that's not good.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wasn't. Phil describes the moment of the \"flashover\", saying flames quickly \"got overhead, and it was above me\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Phil with his wife in a photo taken last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of a sudden, everything's on fire, I could sort of see an orange glow, behind heavy black smoke but not much else,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It went from feeling the heat of flame to feeling like your entire body's in an oven.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an attempt to escape, Phil ended up slamming his burning body at a side door and falling out into the snow, and safety. He suffered life-threatening respiratory damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an incredible coincidence, a camera crew from a local TV station was in the club, filming a video about venue safety. Their 12-minute footage of the fire shows it took just 25 seconds for flames to reach the ceiling, and within 90 seconds, toxic smoke had filled the building. With the doorway then blocked by people piling on top of each other and black smoke pouring from the windows, the video suggests leaving straight away gave them the best chance of survival.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ed Galea, one of the world's leading experts on fire and the way people react to it, explains how heat coming from the flammable foam acoustic panels covering the ceiling in The Station nightclub fire made the situation much worse.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Ed Galea A graphic showing how the fire spread at The Station nightclub.

You don't have the advantage of the time it takes for the fire to develop. It's already in the ceiling. You've got an instant hot layer and when flashover happens, survivability in any space is unlikely,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the investigation into what happened at The Station nightclub, experts from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology built a laboratory version of the club and set it alight. Their official report found flashover conditions were reached after about 65 seconds. After 90 seconds \"conditions in the middle of the room... were found to be lethal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Galea built on these findings, inputting the layout of The Station club into a computer simulator he created which predicts how fires spread. It showed a rapidly expanding burst of heated air, with temperatures inside the club reaching 700C within 80 seconds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the official investigation into the Swiss disaster is ongoing, footage gathered to date suggests this blaze also engulfed the room in a matter of seconds, spreading across the foam-lined ceiling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities say the fire is believed to have been started by sparklers attached to champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations, and that the bar <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx4zxk1np0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">had not undergone safety checks for five years</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"SUPPLIED People hold sparklers attached to champagne bottles in the Swiss ski resort bar just before the fire started - with a small orange patch of fire seen on what looks like a foam ceiling above the sparklers.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">SUPPLIED</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Video from inside Le Constellation appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fire</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fire requires three things: heat, fuel and oxygen. And in a fire such as this, there is a window of seconds to make the decision to get out, before the flashover happens, Galea says. But every disaster Prof Galea has studied has convinced him that people underestimate the speed with which fires can spread.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Chance favours the prepared mind'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call it friendly fire syndrome,\" he says. \"We are not exposed to fire on an everyday basis any more, as we used to be 100 years ago when we were experienced at starting fires for cooking. We have lost all of that connection to how rapidly fire can develop.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hagger says \"some people will stand and physically watch the fire, fixated by what they are seeing. They don't physically perceive the danger. Some will film it, some will even try to hide, rather than escaping.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a famous study from 1968, psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley recruited male Columbia University students and asked them to fill in a form while smoke was pumped into the room. The researchers measured how many students stepped out to raise the alarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they were in the room alone, 75% reacted to the smoke by raising the alarm. But when two other people were with them - who were in on the experiment and had been told not to react - just 10% of the subjects reported the possible fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authors concluded that sometimes an \"individual seeing the inaction of others, will judge the situation as less serious than he would be if he were alone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In The Station fire, crucial seconds passed before both Gina and Phil decided to get out, almost like they were waiting for something to happen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My initial reaction to the fire was, 'Oh, that's interesting',\" Phil says. \"It almost looked like it was just sitting on the surface. It was going to burn out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've been conditioned to believe that there are fire sprinklers or extinguishers nearby, right?

But when people realised, \"it just turned into chaos.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gina says it was the fire alarm triggering, which made people react - almost as if they had to be told to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Swiss fire, footage showed some young party-goers filming the early stages of the fire or trying to put out the flames by waving jackets. On social media, some questioned their actions and were criticised for being insensitive. Galea says the way they acted was nothing to do with their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People are saying, 'It's Gen Z, they don't know what they are doing', but it has been happening ever since I started doing research about this,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has a mantra, which, he says, should guide anyone's thinking when it comes to their safety in a fire: \"Chance favours the prepared mind. You improve your chances by being prepared. Always look for the means of escape.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Preventing another tragedy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to  Galea's decades of research, there have been 38 similar fires claiming about 1,200 lives since the year 2000. Fifteen involved some form of pyrotechnics and about 13 involved acoustic foam or decorative materials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given these precedents, some may wonder why we do not appear to be learning the lessons.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there are shared fire testing specifications, and an industry dedicated to improving safety, there is no internationally enforced \"fire code\". The risk is that a fire in one country does not lead to action to prevent a very similar fire happening in another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster in London, a public inquiry found the London Fire Brigade had been broadly aware of fires involving flammable cladding around the world, but had failed to properly prepare staff to deal with one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compare that with the international aviation industry, which has the advantage of being highly centralised. Air crashes are independently investigated, the findings shared globally, and international directives issued to fix problems, resulting in a good safety record.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gina visits the grave of her former fiance, Fred</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gina and Phil still live with the scars they received in The Station fire. Some 80 of the Swiss fire victims remain in hospitals in Switzerland and other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before that night in 2003, Phil was a competitive swimmer, but the smoke badly damaged his lungs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I had this fight to get my life back, he says. \"I was not going to let these injuries hold me back or define me. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I look at that moment and I say, 'This is what I almost lost',\" Phil says. \"I realised I need to go out and put the effort into the things which really matter.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gina still mourns Fred, whom she lost that night.

Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology &amp; Women's Health</a>, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US President Donald Trump talks into a microphone in the White House, with Robert F.

Does Trump really have the backing in the US, in Congress, even in his own administration to do this?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Is this, as some trade officials have to assume, the biggest TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) of all time?

How would the world react if China or Russia had sent a threat like this to some of their allies?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The basis of the threat is clearly deeply worrying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in capitals around the world will read Trump's social media announcement and question the functioning of American decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump arrives to meet leaders of the allied countries whose economies he has just threatened at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the world will hope that, by that time, this unparalleled threat will have somehow disappeared.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"are-you-in-greenland?-share-your-perspective.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Are you in Greenland?

Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A self-conscious sandwich generation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Popularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities.

He has also referred to Canada as \"the 51st state\" - a jab that has been met with a mix of anxiety and an uncharactaristically fierce display of patriotism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has had an effect not just on how Canadians shop and travel, but on the country's domestic politics and world view. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here are five ways Trump has had an impact on Canada. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A shift in how Canadians see the US</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the relationship between the two countries has had its ups and downs, many Canadians shop, travel and even work in the US, and have family ties to the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the past 12 months has seen a change in Canadians' overall attitudes towards the US, if not towards Americans themselves. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/24/canadians-opinions-of-the-us-and-its-president-are-at-or-near-historic-lows/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Polling conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> last spring indicated that 64% of Canadians held a negative view of the US in 2025 - the highest ever recorded in more than two decades of polling by Pew. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a reversal from how they felt before the second Trump administration, when the majority said they held a favourable view of their neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survey suggested an even larger percentage of Canadians, around 77%, lack confidence in Trump as a president. Nine in 10 respondents described him as \"arrogant\" and three-quarters said they believe he is \"dangerous\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://angusreid.org/carney-asia-trade-apec-asean-korea-malaysia-singapore/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">separate Angus Reid poll</a> from October suggested nearly half of Canadians (46%) want their government to approach the US as an \"enemy or potential threat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is higher than for India (24%) or China (34%). Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has sought to improve the relationship with both of those countries after years of tensions related, among other issues, to allegations of foreign interference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://leger360.com/in-the-news-us-intervention-in-venezuela-raises-alarm-in-canada/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">recent Leger poll</a> conducted earlier this month indicates that one in three Canadians believe the US could take \"direct action\" to control Canada in the future. The poll was in response to the US seizure this month of former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and Trump's renewed comments on annexing Greenland.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Fewer trips south</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long been the number one travel destination for Canadians -

Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair?

In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,\" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy59pvkqvl5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Carney told reporters on Friday</a> that \"the world has changed\" in recent years, and the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's relationship with China, he added, had become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later wrote, in a social media post, that Canada was \"recalibrating\" its relationship with China, \"strategically, pragmatically, and decisively\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as \"very good news\". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China \"would hurt our economy and lead to job losses\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was \"inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China,\" Astvansh added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal \"problematic\" and said Canada may come to regret it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as \"a good thing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" he told reporters outside the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it \"irrelevant\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,\" he said. \"And Canada needs to be prepared.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Aerial view showing hundreds of new energy vehicles waiting to be loaded onto a ro-ro ship for export at Taicang Port on January 15, 2025 in Taicang, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province of China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for over 70% of global production</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas \"until at least the end of the year\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said \"the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said it was the result of an \"unfortunate\" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US has really put Canada in a corner,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces \"some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world\". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that,\" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. \"Let China come in, let Japan come in.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a \"recalibration\" of Canada's trade relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">With additional reporting from Daniel Bush in Washington</b></i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It became a national scandal, Finland's biggest-ever crime, and the then Prime Minister Sanna Marin convened an emergency meeting of ministers to discuss a response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was already too late to stop the hacker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before sending the emails to Vastaamo's patients, the hacker had published the entire database of records stolen from the company on the dark web and an unknown number of people had read or downloaded a copy.

Barbie memorabilia fills her shelves and there's a pole-dancing pole in the centre of her living room. But don't be fooled by how things seem on the surface, Auer says. She has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm outgoing and very confident and I love being around people,\" Auer says, \"but I get that inkling that they all think I'm stupid and ugly, and that my life is a continuum of mistakes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer first sought help in 2015. She told her Vastaamo therapist about her mental health problems, her drinking and a relationship she'd had aged 18 with an older man she'd kept secret from her family. She says she trusted her therapist completely and with his help she made real progress. She had no idea what he had written in his notes of their conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time she received the ransom email, news had already broken about the Vastaamo hack. Three days earlier, the extortionist had begun to drip-feed therapy notes on the dark web in batches of 100 a day, in the hope of putting pressure on the company to pay the much larger ransom - the bitcoin equivalent of around £400,000 - that he had been demanding from them for weeks.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer says she felt compelled to look through them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I had never used the dark web before.

Someone has even built a search engine that allows users to find records on the dark web just by typing in a person's name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer agrees to share some of her leaked therapy records with me. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The patient is mostly angry, impulsive, bitter,\" she says, reading some of the first notes her therapist wrote about their sessions. \"The patient recounts their past in a rambling manner.

It made me feel sorry for the person I had been.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says the data breach has eroded patient trust. \"There are a lot of people who were Vastaamo clients who had gone to therapy for years but are now never going to book another therapy session.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawyer representing Vastaamo's victims in a civil case against the hacker has told me she knows of at least two cases where people have taken their own lives after learning their therapy notes had been stolen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer decided to confront her fears head on.

She spoke to her family about what was in her leaked records, including the secret relationship she had never told them about before. \"People were very supportive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Finally, she chose to take back control of her story by publishing a book about her experiences.
