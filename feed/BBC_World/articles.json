And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale.

I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Greenlander on Trump takeover threats: 'It makes me feel sick to my stomach'</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The scene on a snowy street in Nuuk, Greenland's capital city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was \"scared to death\" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pilu Chemnitz (left) says Greenlanders \"just want to be left alone\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: \"I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they also appreciate the subsidies coming from there that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen hopes Marco Rubio's talks next week with Danish officials \"will end with understanding and compromise\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people,\" she told me. \"We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise,\" she answered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to \"take\" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to \"take\" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">perceived national security concerns</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">a hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"> and his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas.</li></ul></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Snow-covered houses in Nuuk at nighttime</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Geographically Greenland is part of North America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's closer to New York City by about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) than to Copenhagen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This should give Greenlanders pause for thought, opposition MP Pele Broberg of the Naleraq Party told me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said people were scared of what Trump would do to Greenland because they were misinformed, largely because of media hysteria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true, we are not for sale - but we are open for business. Or we should be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Right now we are a colony. We are made to import our goods from Denmark: 4,000km away, rather than from the US which is much closer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Broberg described his organisation as the island's true independence party, pushing he says for freedom, so Greenlanders can trade, on their terms, with any party or country they choose: the US, Denmark or others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But right now, the US is making demands, rather than business deals between equals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what exactly are the national security priorities Trump sees in Greenland?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Briefly put: the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach continental US is Greenland and the North Pole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington DC already has an early warning air base on the island - but Greenland could serve as a base for missile interceptors as part of the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" system: a plan to shield the US from all missile attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also reportedly discussed placing radars in waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK Gap. That's a gateway for Chinese and Russian vessels that Washington wants to track.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no evidence to the naked eye when you are in Greenland to back Trump's recent assertions that there are lots of Chinese and Russian ships currently around the island. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And last week Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticised Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains\" in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia and China have been expanding their military capabilities, and have beefed up their co-operation elsewhere in the region - with joint naval patrols and co-developing new shipping routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under pressure from western sanctions over Ukraine, Moscow is keen to ship more to Asia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing is looking for shorter, more lucrative maritime routes to Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The northern sea route is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice, and Greenland opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023 in pursuit of deeper ties with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it comes to Arctic security, Nato allies hope to persuade Washington that they are serious. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly spoke more than once to the US president last week, telling him that Europe will step up its presence even further in the region. He's also been urging European leaders to increase their cooperation with the US there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland, Denmark and their Nato allies believe there is room for negotiation with Rubio next week and that, at the very least, Trump swooping in to Greenland militarily is unlikely - though not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arctic powers geographically are Denmark, the US, Canada, Russia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. An Arctic Council, representing them all, has long tried to maintain the mantra: high north, low tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But military chest-beating and unilateralism from Washington over Greenland, plus a wider scramble for advantage between global superpowers, adds to a real sense of jeopardy in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decades-long delicate balance in the Arctic, in place since the end of the Cold War, and evenly managed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, could be dangerously upset.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

That means less information is emerging from Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran.

He thanked US President Donald Trump for holding the \"regime to account\", and called on European leaders to do the same.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi has also called for protests to continue from 20:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have also been separate calls for protests by Kurdish opposition groups and some university student groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seventeen Iran-based rights activists, including imprisoned Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, have meanwhile issued a joint statement saying that a peaceful transition from the Islamic Republic is an undeniable necessity for Iran's future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian state media downplayed the scale of Thursday's unrest. In some cases, they denied protests had taken place altogether, posting videos of empty streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, internet watchdog NetBlocks said its metrics showed that Iran was \"in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The incident follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment,\" it warned, referring to previous losses of connectivity in several cities.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQaP2liWDP/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">footage from Lomar, a small town in the western province of Ilam, showed a crowd chanting \"Cannons, tanks, fireworks, mullahs must go\"</a> - a reference to the clerical establishment.

This is a tense moment.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier called on security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" when handling peaceful protests. \"Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,\" a statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khamenei - who has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans critical of the clerical establishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In messages sent to the BBC, via a UK-based activist, a woman in Tehran said despair was driving the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're living in limbo,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm hanging in the air with neither wings to migrate nor hope to pursue my goals here. Life here has become unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the news of the fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And finally, this week - fury when Crans-Montana's Mayor, Nicolas Feraud, revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crans-Montana is in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Mayor Feraud and his colleagues, and they are supposed to happen every 12 months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire.  And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was echoed by Romy Biner, the mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: How well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And, was there any possibility of corruption?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Absolutely not,\" was his indignant answer to the last question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. \"We urgently need complete, transparent answers,\" she wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elected officials in towns like Crans-Montana have many responsibilities as well as fire safety - running schools and social services, even collecting taxes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of these officials work part-time and, once elected, continue with their day jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nowadays some communes may be over-challenged trying to supply and oversee all the services a 21st-Century population expects, but Swiss voters expect better than what they heard from Mayor Feraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The headlines after his press conference were savage. Many demanded Mayor Feraud and his colleagues resign. Feraud ruled this out, saying, \"we were elected by the people. You don't abandon ship in the middle of a storm\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A failure right across the board\", wrote the broadsheet Tagesanzeiger. \"Now Switzerland's reputation is on the line.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An utter disaster\", wrote the tabloid Blick, \"a total failure of fire safety checks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reputational damage is something the Swiss both hate and fear. Switzerland is a rich country, in part because of its reputation for safety, stability, reliability, and, among its own citizens, accountability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If those in charge damage that reputation, and put the country's success at risk, the Swiss are unforgiving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Heads rolled two decades ago when Swissair, the much-loved national airline, went bankrupt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once nicknamed affectionately \"the flying bank\", Swissair's management had made a series of risky financial investments that left the airline dangerously over-extended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2008, banking giant UBS, in which many Swiss, especially pensioners, had shares, had to be bailed out by Swiss taxpayers to prevent not just its own downfall, but disastrous consequences for the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the bank's reckless over-exposure to subprime mortgages was revealed, there was outrage. At the bank's annual general meeting that year, normally sedate elderly shareholders hissed and booed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One even jumped on to the stage, demanding the management give up their generous bonuses, ironically waving a string of Swiss bratwursts under their noses \"in case you go hungry\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crans-Montana, too, has aroused that same angry feeling of trust betrayed. But this is much worse than Swissair or UBS. Forty people, many of them teenagers, are dead. Dozens more have suffered life-changing injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Swiss authorities know there must be answers, quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7jxm7jkg1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Friday's memorial service</a>, the president of Valais, Matthias Reynard, was close to tears as he promised a \"strict and independent\" investigation, warning that \"relevant political authorities\" would be held accountable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Switzerland's president Guy Parmelin said he expected justice \"without delay and without leniency\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner of the bar is now in custody, subject to a criminal investigation, but the role of the local government is sure to be examined, too. There are already calls for fire-safety inspection in Valais canton to be taken away from local town councils and given to the cantonal authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romain Jourdan, a lawyer acting for some of the families, has announced plans to file a case against Crans-Montana's town council. The families, he said, \"are demanding that all local officials be questioned, so that such a tragedy never happens again\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a deeper, nationwide soul-searching going on as well. The Swiss want to know why their beloved devolved system, which many, perhaps complacently, believed to be near perfect, went so catastrophically wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the first hours after the fire, many people, along with their shock and grief, felt a certain quiet pride that their emergency services had responded so quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firefighters, ambulances crews, and even helicopters were at the scene within minutes. The emergency services were present at the memorial service. Many openly wept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shock and grief still sits deep, but the pride has evaporated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What good are top-of-the-range, highly professional emergency services, the Swiss are asking themselves, if basic fire safety checks are neglected?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Switzerland's government says finding answers is a moral responsibility - to the families above all, but also to its own voters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot.

No major financial commitments were immediately forthcoming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said he will unleash the South American nation's oil after US forces seized its leader Nicolas Maduro in a 3 January raid on its capital.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said in Friday's meeting at the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the oil bosses present expressed caution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods said: \"We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Today it's uninvestable.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron is the last remaining major American oil firm still operating in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A handful of companies from other countries, including Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni, both of which were represented at the White House meeting, are also active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're dealing with us directly.

American officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are open for business,\" Trump said. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mixed reactions among some Trump supporters to Venezuela operation</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's oil production has been hit in recent decades by disinvestment and mismanagement - as well as US sanctions. At roughly one million barrels per day, the country accounts for less than 1% of global supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's output, said it expected to bolster its production, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to go to Venezuela,\" said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. \"In real estate terms, it is prime real estate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars,\" said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US state department special envoy for international energy affairs.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exxon and Shell are \"not going to invest single-digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars\", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not really welcome from an industry point of view,\" he said. \"The conditions are just not right.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year, he said those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the \"fantastical\" $100bn figure that Trump has floated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact on production - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability. Americans should not expect the situation in Venezuela to lower oil prices anytime soon, he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-danielle-kaye\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Danielle Kaye</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the questions here are not just for the owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74wexkd598o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They offered no explanation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six Italians were killed as a result.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That includes for those with life-changing injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he's proud of how his team coped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Add to that the anguish of surviving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a delicate moment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment.

It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized  President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as \"safe\" and \"effective\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019.

Petro said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached the White House for comment. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98py70npj9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future</a>. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the US says were being used for drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water \"we are going to start now hitting land\", adding that \"the cartels are running Mexico\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration says it<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ljjd5rwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025</a>. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials said the woman,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Renee Nicole Good</a>, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlz7r0zrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">after a CIA source in Venezuelan government</a> helped the US track his location.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gustavo Petro said Colombia preferred dialogue with the US, but added the country's history showed \"how it has responded to large armies\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" adding: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro denied the claims, saying it has \"always been proven that I'm not involved in that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a \"total peace\" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described \"two simultaneous approaches.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, \"where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred\" and \"where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most.\" Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to \"de-escalate violence\", adding: \"we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Increasingly that includes decisions about relationships and parenthood – and these choices are, in turn, shaping the future of a country in which both marriage and birth rates are falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Millions of Ukrainian women who left at the start of the 2022 full-scale invasion have now built lives and relationships abroad. Hundreds of thousands of men are absent too, either deployed in the army or living outside the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For those women who stayed, the prospect of meeting somebody to start a family feels increasingly remote.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khrystyna, 28, says it's noticeable that there are fewer men around. She lives in the western city of Lviv and has been trying to meet a partner through dating apps without much luck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many, I would say most [men] are afraid to go out now, in this situation,\" she says, raising her eyebrows. She is referring to the men of fighting age who spend most of their time indoors to avoid the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz994d6vqe5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">conscription squads roaming the streets of Ukraine's cities</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for soldiers, \"many are traumatised now because most of them – if they have returned – were in places where they experienced a lot\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Daria feels much the same. \"I only see three options here,\" she says, listing the types of men she believes are available to women like her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First are those trying to avoid conscription. Someone who can't leave the house is probably \"not a person you want to build a relationship with\", Daria says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there are soldiers, forced into long-distance relationships with sporadic visits from the front line. With them, Daria warns, \"you build a connection, then he leaves\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remaining option, she adds, are men under the conscription age of 25. But those aged 22 and under can still leave the country freely, and Daria says they could take off at any moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of these appeal to her.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Supplied A man, in military uniform, drives a car\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Supplied</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Drone operator Denys says the war makes it difficult to promise long-term plans to a partner</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Closer to the front line, many men on active duty are also shelving the idea of starting a a relationship. Uncertainty, they say, makes long-term commitments feel irresponsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ruslan, a soldier serving in the Kharkiv region, knows the promises he can make are limited. Beyond visits once or twice a year, flower deliveries and the odd phone call, he asks, \"what can I actually offer a girl right now?\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Promising a wife or a fiancée any long-term plans is difficult,\" says Denys, a 31-year-old drone operator, in a voice message sent from his position in the east of the country. \"Every day there is a risk of being killed or injured, and then all plans will, so to speak, go nowhere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The consequences of this disruption threaten to ripple far into Ukraine's future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, they already have. Since the start of the invasion, the number of marriages has decreased sharply from 223,000 in 2022 to 150,000 in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has also seen deaths increase, enormous emigration – more than six million people have left the country since 2022, according to an UN estimate – and a stark decline in birth rates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These all lead to a dramatic drop in population, which in turn shrinks the workforce and slows economic growth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oleksandr Hladun, a demographer at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, describes these trends as the \"social catastrophe of war\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this follows Ukraine's population declining between 1992 and 2022, from 52 million to 41 million, due to a high mortality rate, migration and a decline in birth rates.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Birth rates have dropped even lower during the conflict. In 2022, numbers were partly sustained by pregnancies from 2021, Hladun told Ukrainian media earlier this year. In 2023, some couples had children in the hope the war would end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 2024, when it became clear peace was not imminent, the birth rate fell sharply. It now stands at 0.9 children per woman, a record low, and far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the population (for comparison, the total fertility rate in the EU is 1.38).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While a decline in births is to be expected during war, Hladun says, it is generally followed by a peacetime compensatory increase thanks to those who postponed having children. But this effect is limited, usually lasting up to five years – too short a time to have a significant effect on Ukraine's bleak long-term prospects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The longer a war lasts, the smaller this compensatory effect becomes,\" Hladun adds, because couples who put off having children during the conflict no longer get the chance to do so. \"And for us it has already been four years, which is quite a long period.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the National Academy of Sciences, the effects of the war will last well beyond the end of hostilities – which, in any case, is not in sight. The result, it says, could be a population of 25.2 million people by 2051, less than half what it was in 1992.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even committed couples suffer from the uncertainty of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olena, 33, has come to a fertility clinic on the outskirts of Lviv for a check-up. She is a policewoman and military instructor who is currently freezing her eggs, as health issues have made it difficult for her and her husband to conceive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At some point, Olena says, they will try IVF – though only while \"taking into account my work and the situation in the country\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Liubov Mykhailyshyn, right, is worried that the war is affecting the fertility of young Ukrainian couples</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olena remembers life before the war as beautiful and \"full of hope\". But her dreams of starting a family were put on hold by the start of the invasion in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During the first year of the war, it felt as if everything had stopped,\" she says. \"Everything we were striving for – building a home, planning children – nothing mattered anymore.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those fears haven't disappeared, even in Lviv, which like other parts of western Ukraine has, comparatively, been spared the worst of Russia's attacks. But for Olena, the question of having children now carries a sense of duty. \"I am doing this both for myself, and for my family, and for Ukraine,\" she says. Soldiers on the front line, she believes, also die for the sake of unborn Ukrainian children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other side of the desk, Olena's gynaecologist and clinic director Dr Liubov Mykhailyshyn listens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is proud to help \"strong, nice women\" like Olena, she says. But her big concern is the way the war is affecting the fertility of young Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She worries about years of chronic stress and sleepless nights  – as well as the additional physical and psychological trauma for those on the front line. All of these, she says, can cause fertility problems, which could have an impact on birth rates in the years to come.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are waiting for it,\" Mykhailyshyn says of the demographic crisis ahead. Olena nods.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently, the Ukrainian government developed strategies aimed at tackling the problem, including affordable childcare and housing. These policies, however, rely on local authorities rather than centralised funding – meaning projects often don't take off, according to Hladun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as long as would-be mothers and children remain exposed to the dangers of war, state-level efforts might not find much success, he concedes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine now has 17 million fewer people than when it gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union. Only a return of a substantial proportion of the 6.5 million Ukrainians who live abroad could boost figures quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even when the fighting stops, it is unclear how many will come back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People will be more willing to return if Ukraine is able to regain most of the territory seized by Russia since 2014, Hladun suggests. But anything short of that could leave Ukrainians feeling vulnerable as it would be considered a temporary ceasefire rather than a complete end of hostilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite insistence from Moscow that it does not wish to take over the whole of Ukraine, many Ukrainians are convinced that Russia poses an existential risk to their country – and one that will outlast Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Ukraine's population decline should be seen as a security threat, says Hladun. \"Russia is simply demographically much larger,\" he argues. \"And in this sense, it has more resources for war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The longer the war continues, the more the uncertainty will dent the country's prospects for long-term recovery. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Planning a future feels fragile, almost naive,\" Daria says. \"This uncertainty is painful, but it becomes a part of everyday life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've come to accept that I might stay alone not because I want to, but because war reshapes what feels possible,\" she adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Learning to live with that is, in itself, a form of survival.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-liubov-sholudko.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It hasn't really changed anything,\" Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his mum Mau has noticed a change.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Supplied A young boy, with his arms crossed, floating on a inflatable orange ring in a pool with greenery and a waterfall in the background \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Supplied</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aahil, 13, spends more than two hours a day on social media, mainly playing games.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's moodier,\" she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us,\" Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the \"teenage years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban's short-term effects on emotion regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many teenagers, social media isn't just entertainment - it's a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Snapchat's out, WhatsApp's in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old,\" says 15-year-old Lulu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new law has influenced her in other ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am reading a bit more because I don't want to be on social media as much.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she's not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook's Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn't contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it's social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The enjoyment doesn't come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention,\" she says, \"knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When that \"emotional lift\" fades, the platform begins to feel \"oddly unsocial\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kids flock to apps as FOMO sets in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what's known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don't simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall in downloads suggested \"a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere,\" Blacker says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she has never used it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don't feel any need to download or use alternative platforms.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account,\" he says, so \"they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Gaming 'much harder to get into'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months before the ban, debate swirled around the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w90kqgv9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">exclusion of gaming platforms</a>, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there's no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it's a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that's also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Johnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is \"making a real difference\" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays,\" the spokesperson says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Time will tell</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Supplied A partial hand, holding a pen, poised over an open page of an empty diary.

The first was called \"Mosi\", which means \"smoke\" in South Africa's Tswana language, and took place in 2019 with little fanfare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time Mosi II took place in 2023, Russia had launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65787544\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">and the timing of the exercise was heavily criticised</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It fell straight over the first-year anniversary of the Russian invasion,\" says Wingrin. \"So it raised eyebrows because of the timing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current exercise was initially scheduled to take place in November last year and was going to be called Mosi III. But it was postponed because of the G20 leaders' summit that South Africa hosted for the first time - and has been subject to a name change and the invitation broadened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around the middle of last year, we started hearing that it was no longer called Mosi III, but that it was now going to be a Brics+ maritime exercise called 'Will for Peace',\" Wingrin says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the current political climate this expansion could further alienate South Africa from the US, one of its main trading partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"South Africa has been under pressure since the Trump administration came back into power. And even before that, when the Democrats were in power, they also perceived South Africa as anti-American,\" William Gumede, a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the fallout with the Trump administration has been spectacular. He accused the South African authorities of failing to protect its white minority population and offered Afrikaners (who are mainly descended from Dutch settlers), refugee status in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then imposed higher tariffs and removed aid to South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His anger was also partly fuelled by Pretoria's role <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67922346\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in bringing a case against Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a>. The US ally has strongly rejected the allegation of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza as \"baseless\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But overtures by Pretoria and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa's visit in May to the White House, with a delegation that included famous white South African golf players, failed to mend fences. Instead Ramaphosa was ambushed in the Oval Office <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">with a series of contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of South Africa's political parties have said that there is a white genocide in the country. That includes parties that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Trump repeated such claims when he decided to boycott November's G20 summit, which was held in Johannesburg, saying it was a \"total disgrace\" that Africa's largest economy was hosting it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he posted on his social media platform Truth Social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gumede points out that the South African economy, which has been struggling for years, needs access to the US market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We cannot afford to alienate the US. If we add the contribution of the US state, the American private sector as well as US civil society to the South African economy, it is much higher than China's,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"US companies in South Africa alone produce more than 500,000 jobs. If you look at all the Chinese companies in South Africa, saying they create 10,000 jobs, or even 20,000 jobs, would be a generous estimate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This differs from government figures released in 2024, which said China had created around 400,000 jobs in South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the US is much more strategic to us in real terms than China,\" Gumede says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year the central bank warned that the US's new 30% tariffs on South African exports could lead to around 100,000 job losses, with the agriculture and automotive sectors hardest-hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gumede explained that the African National Congress (ANC), the party that brought liberation to South Africa in 1994, sees China as an ideological partner. Russia too is respected for its role in supporting the ANC's struggle against the apartheid regime and white-minority rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the ANC has failed to update its foreign policy to encompass its new coalition partners after losing its parliamentary majority in 2024, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was forced to enter a governing coalition including parties such as the pro-business, Western-aligned Democratic Alliance (DA).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it was a majority party, China was a strategic partner for the ANC government. But now we are in a government of national unity, so what we should have done, as a country and as a government, is to come up with a new foreign policy which is inclusive of the ANC's partners, because the ANC is not a majority partner any more.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"SA National Defence Force South African army and naval officers pictured in Simon's Town harbour with ships behind them\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">SA National Defence Force</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">One South African official said the war games were a good training opportunity for its defence forces and would boost morale </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DA, the second largest party in the country, has heavily criticised the Will for Peace naval exercise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, its defence spokesperson Chris Hattingh said it undermined South Africa's non-aligned foreign policy stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This exercise is being led by China and includes participation by Russia and Iran, both heavily sanctioned and both involved in active conflicts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hosting and training with such forces cannot be described as neutral or non-aligned. It is a political choice, whether the government admits it or not.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Wingrin says there may also have been practical considerations behind the South African military's decision to go ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"South Africa is in a difficult position because years of defunding the defence force and of cutting its budget has left our defence capabilities decimated,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have as many ships capable of going to sea to go to other countries to exercise. So we have to take every opportunity we can to exercise with any country that's willing to come to South Africa.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa has also shrugged off the criticism, saying it is an honour for the country's defence forces \"to practise with well-equipped countries in military terms\" and it will boost the morale of troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Wingrin warns it could spell trouble: \"I don't believe this exercise will result in any military action from any other country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But it may certainly make South African trade negotiations more difficult with certain countries. It's not the exercise per se, it's all about the optics.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A view echoed by other commentators, like Gumede: \"This definitely will be seen as a provocation by the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not a good look for South Africa given the current geopolitics.

The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a \"pathway\" for the special forces to enter unseen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed.

One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,\" says Fitzgerald. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CBS Charred, burnt out cars in what looks to have been a car park\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CBS</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, was hit by US strikes as part of the operation</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The plan</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power.

And it'll be extremely expensive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz (L) speaks with US President Donald Trump \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Friedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'A popular revolt against the establishment'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"European nations are going to have to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yq5zdv907o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">spend much more on their own defence.</a> This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money.

In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

National Resistance Movement (NRM)</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni first took power by force 40 years ago as the leader of a guerrilla army that pledged to restore democracy after years of civil war and the dictatorship of Idi Amin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once feted as being part of a fresh generation of African leaders set to usher in a new democratic era, growing accusations of human rights abuses and harassment of opposition figures have soured that perception.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics say he has ruled with an iron hand since he seized control and having gone back on pledges to step down, he is the only president most Ugandans have known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently the third longest-serving leader in Africa, Museveni has benefitted from two constitutional amendments - removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues that he remains the country's sole guarantor of stability and progress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><b id=\"bobi-wine---national-unity-platform-(nup)\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Bobi Wine - National Unity Platform (NUP)</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one-time hit maker Bobi Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, is widely thought to be the strongest of the seven opposition candidates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dubbed at one point the \"ghetto president\", he is seen as embodying youthful aspirations for change and he enjoys strong support among young, urban, working-class voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine established himself as a serious contender five years ago, coming second and helping to restrict Museveni to the lowest share of the vote in any election he has contested. Bobi Wine's NUP party became the largest opposition force in parliament.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since that vote, Bobi Wine has continued to face harassment from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other candidates are <b id=\"frank-bulira\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Frank Bulira</b>, <b id=\"robert-kasibante\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Robert Kasibante</b>, <b id=\"joseph-mabirizi\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Joseph Mabirizi</b>, <b id=\"nandala-mafabi\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Nandala Mafabi</b>, <b id=\"mugisha-muntu\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Mugisha Muntu</b> and <b id=\"mubarak-munyagwa.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Mubarak Munyagwa.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prominent opposition figure <b id=\"kizza-besigye\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Kizza Besigye</b>, who has run against Museveni four times, is not able to take part and remains in jail on treason charges after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8x3vr6zj2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">being arrested in neighbouring Kenya in 2024</a>.

This time round officials say the vote will be free and fair but UN experts have warned that may not be the case, citing what they describe as a \"pervasive climate of fear\" in Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, rights groups say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amnesty International described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings, and other violent acts as \"a brutal campaign of repression\" ahead of the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says the measures are necessary to ensure a peaceful election and prevent anyone from inciting riots on polling day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it comes to the election itself, Bobi Wine has urged voters to stay at polling stations and safeguard their ballots to help prevent vote rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But election officials have said people should cast their ballots peacefully and then leave, assuring that the vote counting will be transparent and observed by party agents, the media and election monitors. Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the electoral commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite government denials, there are also fears, based on previous experience, of an internet shutdown during the election aimed at preventing people from verifying results. The NUP says it has a vote-monitoring app that can overcome this issue by using Bluetooth technology.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">When will we know the results?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters A view from below of a warehouse worker arranging black metal ballot boxes.
