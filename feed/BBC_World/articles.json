With his support, the legislation overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress earlier this week.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, recently calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work. That position was itself a change from the stance he took ahead of the 2024</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Epstein files subject to release under the legislation are documents from criminal investigations into the financier, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files are different from the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that directly mention Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family of Virginia Giuffre, who <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql67qk0dd3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">died by suicide earlier this year</a>, said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3ef2/live/5c250f30-c555-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A close up image of Trump in the Oval Office.

Elections are due early next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Or, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6xqyzzdxgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">statements </a>or <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lq1e1d79lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">interviews</a>, something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A student-led uprising forced toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A student-led uprising toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.isas.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ISAS-Insights-761.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">paper</a> published by the National University of Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/650b87725caa\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">survey</a> by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region. India shares a 4,096km (2,545 mile) largely porous and partly riverine border with Bangladesh, where domestic turbulence could trigger displacement or mobilisation of extremists, experts say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India should not be in a hurry,\" says Avinash Paliwal, who teaches politics and international studies at SOAS University of London. The path forward, he argues, requires \"quiet, patient engagement with key political stakeholders in Dhaka -including the armed forces\". Diplomacy can buy time.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8b60/live/c998e700-c4ae-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Leon Neal/Getty Images  Chief Advisor to the Government of Bangladesh Professor Muhammed Yunus speaks during an live interview at Chatham House on June 11, 2025 in London, United Kingdom.

Perhaps the deeper question that requires mulling is why India faces the dilemma in the first place,\" says Dr Paliwal. In other words, did Delhi put too many eggs in one basket by backing Hasina so consistently?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You deal with whoever is in power, is friendly, and helps you get your job done. Why should you change that?\" says Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh. \"Foreign policy isn't driven by public perception or morality - relations between states rarely are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Internally, we can't control Bangladesh's politics - it's fractious, deeply divisive, and built on fragile institutions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether India can repair the deeper political rupture remains uncertain. At the same time, much depends on Bangladesh's next government. \"The key is how much Bangladesh's next government lets the Hasina factor impact bilateral relations. If it essentially holds the relationship hostage, then it will be tough to move forward,\" says Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimately, the next elected government will need to balance Bangladesh's core interests - border security, trade and connectivity - against domestic politics and public anti-India sentiment, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't anticipate a serious crisis in ties, but I suspect they'll remain fragile at best.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&amp;P 500.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as for the big question - is it a bubble?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry…</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sundar Pichai: \"We have this phrase at Google, which is 'uncomfortably exciting'.\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Restricted': inside the silicon chip lab</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Google's TPU cluster is developing the chip that could soon power all its AI searches</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">There are several versions of TPUs: the Ironwood is the latest. The TPUs are part of Sundar Pichai's overall strategy of owning the entire scientific supply chain - from the silicon to the data, plus the AI models and everything in between</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">(Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The chips race - and the OpenAI storm</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca6e/live/b9dc59b0-c3b8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images OpenAI CEO Sam Altman \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sam Altman: 'What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure'</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: \"If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer.

So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I put it to him that truth matters.

Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's possible.

Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

They also say that Amhara people in other parts of Ethiopia have been deliberately targeted by the security forces and other armed groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before she was attacked, Enat had never had sex and planned to one day marry at her local church in a ceremony conducted in accordance with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church's rites, just as other women in her family had done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such marriages are among the most revered traditions of the Amhara people, who are predominantly Orthodox Christian, but it requires couples to remain \"pure\" and not have any sexual contact until marriage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Before that day, I had never known a man,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would have been better if they had killed me.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'My family found me unconscious'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tigist, 18, from West Gojjam, also in the Amhara region, worked in her family's small, traditional teahouse before she was attacked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She describes how, in January 2024, a soldier who was a regular customer groped her. She says she rejected him - an act she believes led to the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later that evening, as she was returning home from work, she says three soldiers, including the man who groped her, ambushed her in the street and gang-raped her on the pavement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My family found me unconscious on the roadside,\" she recalls. \"They carried me to the clinic, where I spent five days.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the attack, Tigist says she's been unable to leave her house, paralysed by fear of men and the outside world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My fear keeps me from going to work... Whenever I see soldiers or any men I panic and hide myself away.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She ended up retreating from her life and breaking off her engagement.

Children under 18 accounted for 45% of cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just over half of the victims tested positive for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), while many were also left pregnant and with severe psychological trauma.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, many victims of sexual violence never report the crime or seek treatment, fearful of stigma or of learning they may have contracted an STI or become pregnant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For this reason, a senior health expert, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity due to security concerns, says the victims who come to facilities in the Amhara region are only \"the tip of the iceberg\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lemlem is among those who have never reported their rape or sought medical treatment, terrified of learning that she might have a sexually transmitted infection, such as HIV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 23-year-old from South Gondar says government soldiers entered her house on 6 January to ask for information, a routine army practice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says when she didn't give them what they wanted, one of the soldiers raped her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He threatened me, saying: 'If you scream, one bullet is enough for you,'\" Lemlem says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wept non-stop for a whole month. I couldn't eat. All I did was cry. I couldn't stand to walk.

Instead, most who do seek medical assistance come out of fear of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others seek treatment long after they have been attacked, by which point certain medications for the STIs they have contracted, such as HIV, are no longer effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">HIV can often be prevented with a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis, but only if it is administered soon after sex with someone who was infected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another medic notes that many victims say they are unable to access treatment promptly due to transport disruption and road blockages caused by the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior medic warns they fear a public health and social crisis could be looming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Based on information health centres have gathered, they say that they \"have identified signs that HIV infections may rise and that mental health and psychological problems could reach catastrophic levels\", noting that some victims have attempted suicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Figures from Ethiopia's health ministry in 2022 showed that the HIV rate in the region was around 1.1 per 100 people - higher than the national average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While assaults have been carried out by both sides in the conflict, medical staff report seeing more cases involving Ethiopian army soldiers than Fano militia. A government employee with access to relevant information, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, also said this was the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most incidents of rape were reported in urban areas where the army maintains bases and exerts control, however experts point out that people living in cities have better access to treatment so are more likely to get help and report attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC was unable to interview any victims of assaults by Fano fighters due to limited access to places where the militia are based.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In June 2024, the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that the Ethiopian National Defence Force, which includes the army, had perpetrated sexual violence, including against minors, in the Amhara region during the conflict with Fano militia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked Ethiopia's ministry of defence to respond to allegations, but despite months of waiting, we have not received a reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repeated BBC requests for detailed information from regional authorities were also unsuccessful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Fano leader, Asres Mare Damtie, told the BBC the group was unaware of any involvement by its fighters, saying no accusations had been made against them and it enforces severe punishment, including death, for offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has learned that a government-commissioned investigation led by Ethiopia's Bahir Dar University into conflict-related sexual violence against women in Amhara has begun, with findings expected to be released publicly in the coming months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021, when the army and its allies - which then included Fano - faced similar allegations over their conduct in the Tigray conflict, the government condemned the use of rape but dismissed the claims as \"biased and flawed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To date, no official action has been publicly disclosed against perpetrators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amnesty International has raised concerns over what it believes is a persistent pattern of impunity in Ethiopia's army. \"There is no meaningful effort to bring perpetrators into justice,\" says the organisation's regional researcher, Haimanot Ashenafi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're still fighting, they are still out there with no consequences for what they've done… survivors who have gone through this life-changing experience deserve justice.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Enat, the consequences of her attack have been far-reaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A month after the assault, she fled her village to escape the trauma of the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was then she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I started vomiting,\" she recalls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She thought of having an abortion, which is legally permitted in Ethiopia up to 12 weeks into pregnancy if a woman is raped, but she was scared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feared God, and I felt for my mother.

If there is an accident, like a billion-dollar oil spill, \"good luck with trying to find somebody responsible to pick up any cost\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Driven by record sanctions and tighter enforcement, the number of falsely flagged ships globally has more than doubled this year to over 450, most of them tankers, according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has been tracking one ship that appears to have sailed without a valid flag.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says that vessels travel back and forth, past Estonia, to major Russian oil terminals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of Estonia's navy, Commodore Ivo Värk, says they have seen dozens of such passing vessels this year whereas they used to see just one or two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rise is alarming, he tells me, as we talk in his office overlooking the Gulf of Finland, a narrow gateway to the major Russian oil terminals of Ust-Luga and Primorsk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's more, he suggests, it's brazen: \"There's no secret made about it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We spot the tanker Unity on the MarineTraffic app, the day we board an Estonian (British-built) Minehunter that is also used in Nato's Baltic Sentry patrols to protect critical infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Journeying east, Unity is over 100 miles away but sailing in our direction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has investigated its history and it offers an illuminating insight into the enigmatic life of a shadow ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tracking data shows that Unity has passed through the English Channel four times in the last twelve months, including journeys between Russian ports and India; a key oil customer that has not signed up to the price cap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Originally known as Ocean Explorer, the tanker was built in 2009 and flew the flag of Singapore for more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in 2019, it was named in a UN report for alleged involvement in a ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel that had been sanctioned for its role in transporting fuel to North Korea - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/S/2019/171\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">which is among other countries also charged with utilising elusive shadow ships.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By late 2021, the vessel – which that year operated under the name Ocean Vela – took the flag of the Marshall Islands but was struck from that list in 2024, a registry spokesperson told us, because the ship's then-operator and beneficial owning company had been sanctioned by the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tanker appears to have had three further names since 2021 (Beks Swan, March and Unity) and three further flags (Panama, Russia and Gambia) but always retains a unique IMO number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, ship broadcasting data shows Unity claimed the flag of Lesotho which was designated as \"false\". Lesotho is a small, landlocked African enclave kingdom that, according to the IMO, does not have an official registry.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Over the past year, Unity has made several voyages to and from Russian oil ports</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has tried to contact Unity's listed owner, a Dubai-registered company called <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fmtcship.ae\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">FMTC Ship Charter LLC</a>, but our emails and our calls went unanswered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The beneficial owners of 60% of shadow fleet vessels remain essentially unknown, according to maritime intelligence company Windward AI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opaque ownership structures – and frequent name or flag changes – have become a signature trait of the shadow fleet as a means of avoiding detection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Purged from reputable registries and having circled the drain of poor-quality alternatives, some ships are now at a point \"where they just don't even bother at all\", says Michelle Wiese Bockmann.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unity's most recent journey saw it sail through the North Sea in late October before entering the Baltic and passing countries including Sweden and Estonia - the point at which we spotted it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 6 November, it was anchored outside the Russian port of Ust-Luga where it remains at the time of publication.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tanker was added to the UK and EU's ever-growing list of sanctioned vessels earlier this year but, like so many others, continues to do business despite other difficulties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in January, it reportedly sheltered in the English Channel after suffering a mechanical failure during a storm.

But the devil lies in the detail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 99% of these convictions are for consumption, rather than production, selling, or transport of illicit liquor. Moreover, alcohol remains widely available in the black market in Bihar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the six weeks leading to the recently held election, illicit alcohol worth more than 522 million rupees ($6.26 million, £4.96 million) was seized from across the state. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4df4/live/1defaec0-c445-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Seraj Ali Two armed officers, standing amid drums and jars on a sugarcane farm, destroy an illegal country-made liquor set up in Bihar. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Seraj Ali</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A makeshift setup of metal drums fermenting jaggery into country liquor</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So why has Bihar been unable to enforce its ban more effectively?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local police, who did not want to come on record, say it is a combination of several factors - including staff shortages, increasingly sophisticated smuggling methods and possible collusion between liquor makers and authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are laws that prescribe life imprisonment or even the death penalty for murder. But does that stop people from committing murder? No, it doesn't,\" said Ratnesh Sada, an outgoing minister whose department handled prohibition issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Sada, however, insisted that action has been taken against at least a hundred individuals engaged in illegal alcohol trade, with their properties seized.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We destroy these setups, but within days they are up and running again,\" said Sunil Kumar, an excise official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bihar's geography makes enforcement even harder. The landlocked state borders Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal -  all of which allow alcohol and serve as major sources of smuggled liquor. It also shares a 726km (449 mile), largely porous border with Nepal, which officials say has become a key conduit for alcohol smuggling, further complicating enforcement.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1093/live/2583a4d0-c444-11f0-9b8c-e5538a6f65f6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Seraj Ali Low-quality alcohol flowing from a drum found during a police raid in Bihar state. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Seraj Ali</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Bihar has a thriving black market in locally-brewed alcohol</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the challenges, many women in Bihar -  who still carry deep scars from their husbands' alcohol abuse -  want the ban to continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Chhapra district, Lalmunni Devi, who lost her husband after he consumed toxic liquor in 2022, said her life had been upended by alcohol abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just hope no one else has to suffer the same fate,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neetu Devi, another widow, broke down as she recalled her husband's death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the government were to shut down all such factories entirely, it [liquor] would no longer be available. It continues to be produced, and that's why people keep consuming it,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rajeev Kamal Kumar, an anthropologist at Patna's AN Sinha Institute of Social Sciences, who worked on a government study of prohibition, says both sides of the story are true.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many women and elders say prohibition has improved household finances, children's education, and nutrition. But it is undeniable that illegal trade continues,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bihar is neither the first nor the only Indian state to impose prohibition; several others have tried it over the years. But such measures often trigger unintended consequences - from thriving black markets and deaths from illicit brews, to enforcement challenges that drain state resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The financial cost has also been considerable, as alcohol taxes remain a key source of revenue for many state governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gujarat and Nagaland have had bans since 1960 and 1989, yet both still grapple with bootlegging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mizoram imposed prohibition in 1997, lifted it in 2015, reinstated it in 2019, and then relaxed it again in 2022 to allow the manufacture, sale and export of wine made from local grapes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some other states have rolled back prohibition after encountering economic and administrative challenges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, with the outgoing government slated to return to power, prohibition will remain in Bihar. But the policy remains a paradox - hailed as a social reform by some, criticised as ineffective by others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether it has succeeded or merely shifted the problem underground is a question that continues to haunt the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's very fast-paced, rhythmical and it's addictive,\" he said, adding that the tune has a \"chanting\" effect, which makes it easy for children to remember.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was not an instant hit and only gained traction when its dance routine was featured at children's events in South East Asia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos of children and adults dancing to the song started to spread online and the clip went viral.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was a \"festival-like feeling\" in the Pinkfong office, as the team watched its viewing numbers soar, Mr Kim said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November 2020, the Baby Shark clip claimed the title of YouTube's most viewed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It generated around half of the firm's revenue in the years immediately after the video's release and became a springboard for new content and merchandise, he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Baby Shark: It's got a catchy tune and plans for world domination - but the toddler hit is older than you think</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pinkfong faced a legal challenge in 2019 when it was accused of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwyvxrdd7yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plagiarising the work of an American composer</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's Supreme Court rejected the case, after the company argued that its version was derived from a folk song in the public domain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The victory, Mr Kim said, gave the firm a lift as its shares went public. He added that the stock market application had been filed before the verdict was announced.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">One-hit wonder?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pinkfong's other franchises like Bebefinn and Sealook are growing fast but the firm must prove its success is not just reliant on Baby Shark, said Korea University business lecturer Min Jung Kim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company's target audience is a major plus as toddlers tend to watch the same material repeatedly, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"> Kim Min-seok insists his business can grow beyond Baby Shark, which currently accounts for about a quarter of Pinkfong's revenue. Meanwhile, Bebefinn has leapt ahead, generating roughly 40% of the firm's earnings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One parent told the BBC that his family has mixed feelings about Pinkfong's videos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Father of two Saleem Nashef said he appreciates the educational qualities of the firm's content but his wife thinks Baby Shark is \"too over-stimulating for kids\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the viral video is apparently inescapable, as his daughter, who is about to turn three, will have a Baby Shark-themed birthday party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether Pinkfong can create other characters to match Baby Shark's commercial appeal remains unclear, said Prof Kim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raised almost $52m in its stock market debut and plans to use the money to expand its line-up of films and characters, said Mr Kim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company also aims to become a \"tech-driven\" content creator, using viewing patterns and other data to shape its new projects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pinkfong has already achieved \"what many creators have always dreamed of,\" Mr Kim said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But now it must show investors that it is not just a one-hit wonder.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
