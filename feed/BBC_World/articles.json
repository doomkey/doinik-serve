Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

that also saw strikes on military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, \"was not simply a narcotics operation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an act of war,\" Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, \"You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and in dollars,\" Schumer said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Schumer and Jeffries

On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago.  Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance?  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sounded as if he believes something like that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military operation is only the first stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neither country was in America's backyard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China condemned the US action. It said \"hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US should \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even so, China might see a precedent set by the US action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is not how the world of power works. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi is expected to hold a welcoming ceremony for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, state-run CCTV reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.    </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country \"respects the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38285354\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">One China policy</a>\" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Lee said on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to  the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee will also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

and many other nations - did not recognise Nicolás Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president, having denounced the 2024 election as rigged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was declared president by Venezuela's electoral council (CNE), a body dominated by government loyalists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the CNE never produced the detailed voting tallies to back up their claim and copies of voting tallies collected by the opposition and reviewed by the Carter Center suggested that the opposition candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fa5/live/ecca51d0-e990-11f0-8c13-1355ac9f9bd1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"JUAN BARRETO/AFP via Getty Images Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado hold hands up with opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia in Caracas on July 29, 2024, a day after the Venezuelan presidential election.

She described the approach as unprecedented in modern times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his news conference, President Trump said that the US was \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so\", which appears to explain why he thinks that Delcy Rodríguez has no choice but to do the US's bidding. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fa4/live/6e079b00-e990-11f0-abce-2b22587e05c3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gaby Oraa/Bloomberg via Getty Images Nicolas Maduro, right, speaks to members of the media, next to Cilia Flores, center, and Delcy Rodriguez, after casting a ballot during a referendum vote in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sunday, Dec. 3, 2023.

I don't,\" he added, seemingly implying that he was not as certain of Rodríguez's willingness to work with the US as Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What he was adamant about was the US's willingness to pressure Rodríguez's interim government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with ABC, Rubio also appeared to suggest that fresh elections should be held in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Government will come about through a period of transition and real elections, which they have not had,\" he told This Week. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also appealed for \"realism\", suggesting that fresh elections would take time: \"Everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">John Bolton, who worked on plans to remove Venezuela's president when he was national security adviser in Trump's first term, welcomed the US military operation and Maduro's capture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the prominent Trump critic told the BBC it was unlikely Rodriguez would bend the knee to the US, particularly as the regime still had backing from China, Russia and Cuba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The rational thing to do here is bring down what's left of the Maduro regime and put the opposition in power pending free and fair elections. They have people capable of running an interim administration while elections are set up.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Talk of fresh elections<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>will no doubt disappoint not only María Corina Machado and Edmundo González but also many of the Venezuelans who voted for them and who have been adamant that they want to see those votes honoured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition has long insisted that free and fair elections are not possible while the key institutions involved in organising them are stacked with Maduro loyalists.  A reform of those bodies will take time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the short term, therefore, Venezuela looks likely to be governed by Delcy Rodríguez and Maduro's inner circle - as long as they meet the Trump administration's expectations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How long that may last will depend on whether Rodríguez can find a golden middle between accommodating Trump's requests and the Maduro base interests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She may soon find herself between a rock and a hard place. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prof Xavier Crettiez says that fighting financial crime is a now key job for spies</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organized crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years.

And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specializes in money laundering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cybersecurity and spying threats as well as sabotage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the younger students, Alexandre Hubert, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another class member, Valentine Guillot, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Students Alexandre Hubert and Valentine Guillot were happy to be photographed</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly half of the students in the class are in fact women.

It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when US President Donald Trump gave approval, but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Good luck and godspeed'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EST on Friday (03:46 GMT on Saturday). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: go,\" Trump himself told Fox &amp; Friends on Saturday, hours after the overnight raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said to us, and we appreciate it... good luck and godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-hour-and-twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence... it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\"

decades as Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the first signs of Operation Absolute Resolve were in the skies. More than 150 aircraft - including bombers, fighter jets and reconnaissance planes - were ultimately deployed through the course of the night, according to US officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was very complex, extremely complex, the whole manoeuvre, the landings, the number of aircraft,\" Trump told Fox News. \"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Loud explosions were heard in Caracas at about 02:00 local time (06:00 GMT), and plumes of smoke were seen rising over the city. \"I heard a huge sound, a loud bang,\" reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero told the BBC. \"It moved all the windows. Immediately after I saw a huge cloud of smoke that almost blocked the entire view.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added: \"Planes and helicopters were flying all over the city.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Smoke, bangs and helicopters in Caracas</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, videos showing numerous aircraft in the skies - and others showing the apparent aftermath of explosions - began to circulate widely on social media. One showed a convoy of helicopters flying at low altitude over Caracas as smoke rose from apparent detonations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We woke up at around 01:55 to the roar of explosions and the hum of planes flying over Caracas,\" one witness, Daniela, told the BBC. \"Everything was plunged into absolute darkness, illuminated only by the flashes of nearby detonations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added: \"Neighbours were messaging in the condominium group chat, all confused and unaware of what was happening [and] frightened by the blasts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has examined a number of videos showing explosions, fire and smoke in locations around Caracas to identify exactly which sites were targeted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, it has confirmed five locations including Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base, an airfield known as La Carlota and Port La Guaira, Caracas' main conduit to the Caribbean Sea.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the US strikes targeted air defence systems and other military targets, officials said. Trump also suggested the US cut the power in Caracas before the mission began, though he did not specify how. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have,\" he said. \"It was dark and it was deadly.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'They knew we were coming'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As strikes rang out around Caracas, US forces made their way into the city. They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US news partner CBS.

Trump described the safe house as a military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas, saying: \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the US helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump remarked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in the US Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator.

Instead of recreating the crime, the movie tells the story of what comes after: the everyday life of high-schooler Joo-in, from  school to romance to family and friendships, and all the moments of conflict and joy that go along with it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has earned the praise of critics and audiences, and more than $1.1m in box office revenue since its debut in October. Viewers have given it a 9 out of 10 on South Korea's largest search portal, Naver.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Simply a masterpiece,\" is how Bong Jun-ho, director of the globally acclaimed film Parasite and the first Korean to win an Oscar, described it. He called himself the \"head of the Seoul branch of Yoon Ga-eun's fan club\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The film has resonated in a deeply patriarchal country, where women say they fight hard just to be heard. And its surprising success is a sign of the growing willingness to engage in conversations about sexual violence and how survivors are treated.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'That's not all I am'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World of Love may not seem like an obvious choice for movie-goers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Korean title, \"Joo-in of the World\", says little about the plot. While it stars Parasite actor Jang Hye-jin and K-drama star Go Min-si, the lead is played by Seo Su-bin, a new face on the big screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At its heart, this is a story about the the life of 17-year-old Joo-in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything is going well for her.

It's one part of her identity and it shakes her, but she insists, 'That's not all I am'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When she decided to make a film about sexual violence, Ms Yoon was clear about one thing.

She spoke with survivors and consulted activists. Those conversations shattered the \"prejudice\" she carried, an ignorance that \"reduces a person entirely to their wound\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We spent so much time talking about completely ordinary concerns,\" she said. \"Worries about work, family, friendships and romances, about needing to lose weight or gain weight or exercise more.
