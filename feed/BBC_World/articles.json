Israel denied what it called \"the false claim of deliberate starvation\" in Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian officials are yet to comment on the plan for humanitarian corridors, or on the reported airdrop into Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry said six more people had died from malnutrition, bringing the number since the start of the conflict to 133, with the majority dying in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IDF said it would open humanitarian corridors for aid convoys in Gaza to allow the UN and other organisations to deliver food and medicine to Palestinians across the strip. The routes would be in place from 06:00 to 23:00 local time (04:00 BST to 21:00 BST).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pause in military activity would take place in three areas - Al Mawasi, Deir al-Balah and Gaza City - from 10:00 to 20:00 local time (08:00 BST to 18:00 BST) each day until further notice, the IDF added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN and other aid organisations, alongside some of Israel's allies, have blamed the country for a growing food crisis in Gaza, and have called for the unrestricted entry and delivery of aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tom Fletcher, the UN's humanitarian chief, said the humanitarian pause for aid was a welcome announcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added: \"In contact with our teams on the ground who will do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least nine Palestinians were killed and 54 others wounded in an Israeli shooting as civilians gathered at an aid convoy route in central Gaza, according to medical officials on Sunday. The IDF has been approached for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The spokesman of al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat said the victims were brought to its site. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Photographs on Sunday showed lorries carrying aid queuing at Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt, awaiting access into the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The World Health Organization (WHO) chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, described the food crisis in Gaza as \"man-made mass starvation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IDF said that responsibility for food distribution to the population in Gaza \"lies with the UN and international aid organisations\" and added they must \"ensure that the aid does not reach Hamas\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier on Sunday, the IDF said an aid airdrop \"was carried out in co-ordination with international organisations and led by Cogat\", referring to the Israeli military body which oversees the entry of aid into Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The military also posted a video purportedly showing a plane dropping the aid. The footage has not been independently verified. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Late on Saturday, the Israeli military also stated that it had resumed supplying power to a desalination plant in Gaza, which it said would \"serve about 900,000 residents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel cut off all supplies to Gaza from the start of March, and resumed with new restrictions in May. <b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Along with the US, it backed the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20rz63g1zko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Gaza Humanitarian Foundation</a> (GHF) and allowed it to operate in Gaza. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There have been almost daily reports of Palestinians being <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg4rwrkdlzxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">killed while seeking aid</a> since the GHF began operations in late May. Witnesses have told the BBC most have been shot by Israeli forces. Israel has said that its troops fire warning shots and has disputed reported death tolls. It accuses Hamas of instigating chaos near the aid points.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's apparent concessions followed its acceptance of a Jordanian and UAE plan, backed by the UK, to air drop aid into Gaza. Aid agencies however said such moves would do little to mitigate the hunger of Gazans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, said air drops were \"expensive, inefficient, and can even kill starving civilians\" if they did not go according to plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lazzarini said his organisation had \"the equivalent of 6,000 trucks\" in Jordan and Egypt waiting to enter Gaza, and urged Israel \"lift the siege, open the gates and guarantee safe movements and dignified access to people in need\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC spoke to several Gazans on Saturday who worried air drops could cause \"serious harm\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One man living in the north of the strip told BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily that the process was \"unsafe\" and \"caused numerous tragedies\" when similar relief efforts were attempted last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When aid is dropped from the air, it risks landing directly on tents, potentially causing serious harm, including injury or even death,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Palestinians are battling dehydration along with starvation. One mother told the BBC she was \"living with no food or drink, no food, no bread, not even water.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel launched a war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 59,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

When the plane hit, her father was at prayer - he ran barefoot from the mosque as soon as he heard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her uncle, Syed Billal Hossain, told me that the family spent the entire night searching more than half a dozen hospitals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We walked across Uttara, helpless. Someone said six bodies were at one hospital.  At one in the morning on Tuesday, her father identified her - by her teeth and a problem in her eye. But we still haven't been given the body.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pain of losing a child was only compounded by the bureaucratic maze. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite identifying their daughter by a dental feature and a lens in her eye, the family was told the body wouldn't be released without DNA tests -  because there were multiple claimants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">First, a police report had to be filed. Then the father gave blood at the military hospital. Now they were waiting for the mother's sample to be drawn. \"We know it's her,\" said Mr Hossain. \"But they still won't hand over the body.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wakia, the youngest of three siblings, lived next door to her uncle in an old ancestral home in Diabari. \"She grew up in front of our eyes - playing on rooftops, sitting under the coconut tree next to our house, always cradling her baby niece. She was just a child, and she loved children,\" said Mr Hossain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I saw her just the day before,\" he said. \"If not for that after-school coaching, she'd be alive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the chaos and heartbreak that followed the crash, moments of narrow escape and immense courage stood out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One mother told BBC Bengali how she'd given her child money for tiffin instead of packing lunch that morning.

A small number of votes are still being counted.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday, citizens in 24 districts – all held by the Kuomintang - voted on a simple yes or no question: whether they agreed to boot out their legislator.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Taiwan held recall votes in the past, it had never seen so many within such a short period of time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Early results show that a majority of voters in every district voted no, which means none of the lawmakers have to vacate their seats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The opposition maintains its slim majority - for now. Another round of recall voting will be held in August for seven other seats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Analysts have said that if the Great Recall fails, it would intensify political polarisation in Taiwan, and embolden politicians to do what they want despite opposition from a significant segment of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Great Recall has deeply divided Taiwanese society, which has seen large rallies and fierce debate. Both pro-recall and anti-recall activists claimed to be fighting for Taiwan's democracy.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What's behind the Great Recall ?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It began with elections in January 2024, when voters chose the DPP's William Lai as their president but gave the opposition the dominant presence in the parliamentary Legislative Yuan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the following months, the main opposition party Kuomintang worked together with the smaller Taiwan People's Party and independents to block DPP bills and pass controversial pieces of legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These moves angered some Taiwanese, who saw these as attempts to stymie the DPP government while strengthening the opposition's parliamentary power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2024, thousands began holding protests in what became known as the Bluebird movement, partially named after the Taipei street where many had gathered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many in the movement believe the opposition, led by the Kuomintang which is known for its relatively friendlier position on China, is being influenced by Beijing and secretly pushing China's agenda in Taiwan's legislature.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The party has denied this, but suspicion grew when a group of Kuomintang lawmakers visited China last year and were welcomed by top-ranking Chinese Communist Party official Wang Huning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Civic groups in the Bluebird movement launched petitions to oust various Kuomintang lawmakers, while Kuomintang supporters retaliated by doing the same to some DPP lawmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the end, petitions for 31 lawmakers' seats received enough preliminary support to proceed with a final recall vote.

It is known for its crystalline bell-like tone and has been Kashmir's musical signature for centuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ghulam Mohammed belongs to a lineage of craftsmen who have been building string instruments in Kashmir for over seven generations. The Zaz family name has long been synonymous as the makers of the santoor, rabab, sarangi and sehtar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in recent years, the demand for handcrafted instruments has dwindled, replaced by machine-made versions that are cheaper and quicker to produce. At the same time, music tastes have changed, adding to the decline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"With hip hop, rap, and electronic music now dominating Kashmir's soundscape, younger generations no longer connect with the depth or discipline of traditional music,\" says Shabir Ahmad Mir, a music teacher.

Growing up, he was surrounded by the sounds and tools of his family's trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Health issues forced him to leave formal education at an early age and that is when he began learning the art of santoor-making from his father and grandfather - both master craftsmen themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They taught me not just how to make an instrument but how to listen - to the wood, the air and the hands that would play it,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My ancestors used to be summoned by the courts of local kings and were often asked to build instruments that could soothe hearts,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his workshop, a wooden bench lined with chisels and strings lies beside the skeletal frame of an unfinished santoor. The air smells faintly of aged walnut wood, but there is no machinery in sight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ghulam Mohammed believes machine-made instruments lack the warmth and depth of those crafted by hand and the audio quality comes nowhere close. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Making a santoor is a slow, deliberate process, the craftsman says. It starts with selecting the right wood, aged and seasoned for at least five years.

He appreciates the attention but says it hasn't led to real efforts to preserve the craft or its legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These are good people,\" he says, \"but what will become of this place when I am gone?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With his three daughters pursuing other careers, there's no one in the family to carry on his work.

What he truly wants is someone to carry the art forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now in his eighties, he often spends hours beside an unfinished santoor, listening to the silence of what's yet to be completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is not just woodwork,\" he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is poetry.

This step is crucial for developing the tea's signature \"umami\" flavour - a savoury taste that complements its natural sweetness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The leaves are harvested, dried<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>and ground into powder using stone mills, which can produce just 40g (1.4oz) of matcha an hour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in recent months growers have struggled, as record-breaking heatwaves have hit crops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the Kyoto region, where about a quarter of Japan's tencha comes from, hot weather has led to poor harvests even as demand soars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The country also faces a shortage of farmers as its population ages and not enough younger people go into the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shops in Uji, a city in Kyoto famous for matcha, often see their <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250606-matcha-how-tourism-drained-a-japanese-town\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">shelves emptied</a> by tourists as soon as their doors open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As a result, many retailers have set limits on how much customers can buy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kyoto-based Camellia Tea Ceremony allows customers to purchase only one tin of matcha each as visitor numbers doubled over the last year, says director Atsuko Mori.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tea master Rie Takeda says she also<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>has to closely monitor her stocks of matcha, as orders that would previously arrive in just days can now take more than a week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She works for Chazen, a tea ceremony chain based in Tokyo, which hosts traditional rituals serving matcha to guests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shortages mean tea prices at Chazen's outlets have risen by around 30% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[The demand] is good,\" Ms Takeda said through a translator. \"It's a gateway for more people to know about Japanese culture.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has also attracted more growers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Matcha production nearly tripled between 2010 and 2023, according to Japan's agricultural ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also says green tea exports, including matcha, also rose 25% last year to 36.4bn yen (£180m; $250m).</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Savour, not hoard</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The matcha craze has sparked a movement to promote more mindful consumption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Advocates call out people they see as hoarding matcha or profiteering from its popularity.

Trump Golf currently owns 11 courses in the US and three in the UK, manages several others and has plans for new resorts in Oman, Indonesia, Vietnam and Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Golf clubs are a prized possession for Trump – and not always a profit-making one. According to filings with the British government, Trump's Balmedie course lost $1.83m (£1.35m) in 2023 – its 11th-straight year running a deficit. Turnberry, on the other hand, reported about $5m in profit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has at times clashed with local authorities over land use and sought to restrict construction of wind turbines off the coast of his Balmedie property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While his US courses have hosted major professional tournaments, he has long wanted Turnberry, which he will visit this weekend, to be the site of a future British Open Championship.

The two would later play five rounds together – forging a friendship that lasted until Abe was assassinated in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's regular golf partners have included close political allies, like South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, and Republicans with whom he sought to forge new connections, such as 2016 presidential rival Rand Paul of Kentucky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He's a little better golfer than I am, admittedly, but we had a good time,\" Paul said after a 2017 round with the president, adding that the two mostly focused on golf – but also discussed Trump's tax policies.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec8a/live/d15a9600-68a6-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Donald Trump and Shinzo Abe walk along a green, open fairway in the mid-distance with lots of trees behind them in the distance.

Stubb would later say that they talked about the war in Ukraine, Russia and global security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Finnish history, it's quite rare that the Finnish president has spent so much time with the president of the United States, either physically or on the phone or messaging,\" Stubb told Canadian broadcaster CBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's this kind of access, and influence, that has made a tee time with Trump a coveted prize for those seeking a presidential audience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Anybody who is sophisticated dealing with Donald quickly understands that everything about him is transactional,\" said Professor David Cay Johnston of Rochester Institute of Technology, who as a reporter covered Trump for decades and has written three books about the man.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you're the head of a company or the head of a nation, you either try and minimise any prospective damage he might do to you by buttering him up or to size him up on something if you're unsure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even back at the White House, foreign leaders have tried to parlay a golf connection into a friendly reception. When South African President Cyril Ramaphosa visited the Oval Office in May, he gave the president an illustrated South African golf book and included golf professionals Ernie Els and Retief Goosen in his national delegation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That didn't help much, however, as the meeting devolved into <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">an extended confrontation over South African land confiscation policies</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d26e/live/ea1ab3f0-6964-11f0-9519-e3a8ae3ab590.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump Donald Trump poses for a photo with Alexander Stubb\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Truth Social/@realDonaldTrump</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Trump partnered with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in a tournament earlier this year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While that drama played out in front of the gathered press and live television cameras, Trump may see benefit from his more cloistered golf outings, as it gives him an opportunity for meetings well removed from the prying eyes of journalists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reporters accompany Trump on all of his public movements, but when the president is on the golf course they are kept well away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has time out of the eye of anybody else to deal with people,\" Johnston said. \"And of course, those heads of corporations or states, similarly, are going to use the opportunity to be away from any spotlight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president's penchant for privacy on the links also means there are wildly conflicting accounts of how good a golfer Trump really is. He boasts of winning dozens of club championships - all on courses he owns - including five this year alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sports journalist Rick Reilly, in his 2019 book Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, writes that Trump's championship claims are so \"over-the-top\" that he loses all credibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He details what he says is Trump's penchant for cheating, including moving his ball to better spots on the course and taking multiple mulligans – a custom in which a player is allowed to replay a stroke with no penalty, after a mishit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He's a notorious cheat,\" Johnston said. \"I spoke to someone once who played a round of golf with him, who told me that he had taken six mulligans on a single hole.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Mulvaney, who says he never saw Trump cheat, the president may use golf as a way to connect, but 18 holes with the president isn't about business or government or politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is golf,\" he said. \"And while that sounds obtuse, golfers know what I mean.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What the French hope is that their announcement will in the meantime generate diplomatic momentum and encourage other nations to join them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The French president likes to make bold, dramatic plays on the international stage. But it is a gamble.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In particular, he is relying on the UK to follow his lead. When Macron visited Parliament a few weeks ago, he told MPs and peers that \"working together to recognise the state of Palestine and to initiate this political moment is the only path to peace\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One senior French diplomat told me a few days ago that if the UK acted together with France it would convince other countries to join \"because two parent members of the UN Security Council (UNSC) shows we mean business\". The US, China and Russia are the other permanent members on the UNSC, with ten other countries elected for two-year terms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They added: \"The best contribution that France and the UK can bring is to restart the process by bringing all stakeholders around the table, making commitments to the state of Palestine and the security of Israel. We have this power, this opportunity together to restart this process.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is that the British prime minister has thus far been reluctant to take this step in recognising a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That, in part, reflects traditional British policy. The UK has long argued that the act of recognising a Palestinian state should not be wasted on what some see as gesture politics. One senior source questioned what impact the French decision would have apart from making Macron feel better. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, officials argue this diplomatic card should be used productively to drive momentum in a long-term political settlement; a lever with which to get a deal over the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other words, recognition was part of the end game. Such is the sensitivity about this issue that David Cameron, as foreign secretary, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-68137220\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">ruffled feathers last year</a> when he even suggested recognition could be brought forward as part of a process and not the final move. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the French decision suggests they now believe recognition should not be even a stage in a diplomatic sequence but a trigger to open it all up, a shock to the status quo demanded by continued Israeli intransigence and the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK has also been cautious traditionally about recognising a Palestinian state for fear of upsetting its allies, the US and Israel, which are firmly opposed to such an idea, believing it to be, in their view, a reward for terrorism. The UK has also been reluctant to invest too much support in an unreformed Palestinian Authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So for now the UK has been stalling for time. On Thursday night, the prime minister issued a statement saying: \"We are clear that statehood is the inalienable right of the Palestinian people. A ceasefire will put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state and a two-state solution which guarantees peace and security for Palestinians and Israelis.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other words, there has to be at the very least a ceasefire before recognition becomes possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Foreign Secretary David Lammy told MPs on the International Development committee last week that recognition had to be part of a process towards secure a two-state solution - a political settlement based on two separate states that protect the rights of Palestinians and the security of Israelis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"No country has a veto on our decisions,\" he said. \"When and how to recognise is our decision. I am simply making the point that the act of recognition does not get you two states; it is a symbolic act.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is that, according to UK officials, this decision has moved from the diplomatic sphere to the political. In other words, the government is now under huge pressure from its MPs to act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whenever ministers defend the status quo in the House of Commons, they are assailed on all sides by MPs calling for recognition. Joint letters to Downing Street are being written by retired diplomats and coalitions of MPs. The Foreign Affairs Committee has also issued a report backing recognition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even Cabinet ministers are joining in. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told MPs he hoped that the international community would \"recognise the state of Palestine while there is a state of Palestine left to recognise\". That raised eyebrows in Whitehall because the formulation strayed firmly outside the official Cabinet position that recognition should come only \"at the point of maximum impact\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So all eyes are now on what the British government decides. If it fails to follow the French lead, it may well risk votes and rebellions in Parliament. One official suggested to me this could well follow welfare reform as the next big issue to trigger a Labour backbench revolt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The risk is that, alternately, Britain follows France begrudgingly and is dragged into recognition without any significant diplomatic gain. It will have played a one-time card to little avail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 140 countries around the world have already recognised Palestine as a state. Last year, Ireland, Spain, Norway and Slovenia joined them, with minimal impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Future political declarations about Palestinian statehood may well be significant. But how much they change the reality in the short term for people on the ground in Gaza is an open question.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The White House has recently suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the contents of any unreleased documents remain unknown, the existing materials in the public domain mention a number of high-profile figures who were connected to Epstein - though that does not imply any illegal activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president previously said he would be open to making public more information on Epstein. But he changed his position earlier this month, saying the case was closed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The frustration over what many Americans see as a simple request is now being given voice by some prominent allies of the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Look, I'm where I've been every time y'all ask me this question,\" said Thom Tillis, a US senator in Trump's Republican Party who has sometimes tangled with Trump. \"Release the damn files.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: Trump calls out \"stupid Republicans\" in Jeffrey Epstein files saga</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A US justice department official spoke to Maxwell in prison on Thursday, although few details emerged about what she was questioned about and how she responded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although Trump's biggest supporters are sticking by the president, many are trying to square their backing for his Make America Great Again (Maga) movement with what they apparently see as his stonewalling of further information drops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Maga influencers have found themselves on the defensive as they try to stand by their man after years of demanding Epstein transparency – a call that was endorsed by Trump during last year's presidential campaign, and vociferously pushed for years by several top administration officials including FBI director Kash Patel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Laura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist with a huge social media following, who is an informal yet influential White House adviser, posted a link to a news article in which she said \"Trump is not implicated\" in the Epstein files.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Along with messages of support, blowback on X came fast:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"How would you know.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He literally partied with Epstein.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dozens of other users responded with memes and historical pictures of Trump and Epstein together, before they fell out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And messages like \"We want to see the Epstein files!\" – which one follower posted at conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk – seem about as common online at the moment as the most popular slogan used by case obsessives: \"Epstein didn't kill himself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The phrase is a reference to one of the most common conspiracy theories, that Epstein was killed by an unknown assailant and did not take his own life, as the official narrative states, when he died in prison in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The justice department and FBI rejected that theory in a memo earlier this month. They also said they had no rumoured Epstein \"client list\" that could implicate high-profile associates besides Maxwell in Epstein's criminal operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was that memo that kicked off the renewed focus on Epstein that has recently dominated the US news cycle.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9a72/live/e4e66850-692f-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters Laura Loomer exiting a plane, looking down and holding a phone in her hand\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Like many Maga influencers, Laura Loomer has been caught between loyalty to Trump and demands for more information about Epstein's crimes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After initially questioning government officials, and demanding more document releases, many popular Maga influencers – including Loomer, Jack Posobiec, and pro-Trump Substack blogs and sites like ZeroHedge – appear in recent days to be backing off the topic and trying to turn the attention of their audiences elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But others - including former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and podcaster Benny Johnson - have continued to cover the saga in detail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The episode has driven even some of Trump's most steadfast supporters to turn on the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week Jacob Chansley - the so-called QAnon Shaman who was sentenced for rioting at the US Capitol in January 2021 wearing horns, fur and face paint - posted a string of expletive-laden messages directed at Trump on X.

But this week news organisations – including the BBC – warned that the lack of food means those freelancers are increasingly unable to feed themselves and their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli government, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, says starvation is not its fault and blames Hamas for stealing food. Most international aid organisations say it is Israel that is failing the population. As the occupying power under international law Israel has a legal responsibility to protect the population from hunger and starvation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We've collated the stories of some of those who have spoken to us and images from the week – this report contains images of malnourished children.</p></div></div></body></html>"
