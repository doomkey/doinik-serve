Since the internet was shut down, it has become one of the last, if not the last, remaining channels for Iranians to communicate with the outside world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached SpaceX to confirm it has waived the fee, but they are yet to respond.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Using the service in Iran carries a punishment of up to two years in prison and authorities have reportedly been searching for Starlink dishes to stop people from connecting to the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're going onto rooftops and checking the surrounding buildings,\" says Parsa -

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria.

But it turned out that the cake's producer, Balocco, had given a one-off €50,000 (£43,300) donation to the hospital before the cake's launch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ferragni has 28 million followers on Instagram and, after her companies made €1m from the promotion, she pledged to donate the same sum to the hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The outcry led authorities to initiate a formal investigation and the influencer was handed a €1m fine in 2023 by Italy's competition authority over the pandoro cakes, branded with her name and mentioning the children's hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ferragni-branded Easter eggs also became part of the scandal, leading the influencer to agree to pay €1.2m to a children's charity to settle complaints that the eggs' sales allegedly misled consumers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was later indicted on the aggravated fraud charges, along with business associate Fabio Damato. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of one year and eight months in prison for Ferragni but the judge rejected their accusation that the fraud should be seen as aggravated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Milan court found that no aggravation had been involved as a consumer group had withdrawn its original complaint. Ferragni had agreed with consumer organisation Codacons that she would compensate consumers and donate money to a charity for women who had suffered gender violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all moved,\" Ferragni told reporters at the end of the trial. \"The last two years have been very hard. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite her acquittal the scandal has proved damaging to Ferragni's brand and affected her personal life. Her marriage to Italian rapper Fedez fell apart last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also led to tighter rules for Italian influencers to show greater transparency in their fund-raising initiatives.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Within 24 hours of the incident, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from more than 27,000 donors. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Ford spokesperson told CBS: \"One of our core values is respect and we don't condone anyone saying anything inappropriate like that within our facilities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When that happens, we have a process to deal with it but we don't get into specific personnel matters.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the subtitles provided by TMZ, the heckler called Trump a \"paedophile protector\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the clip, which shows Trump from a distance, the president can be seen speaking back at the heckler, allegedly mouthing an expletive as well as using a middle-finger gesture.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A man who spoke to The Washington Post, named TJ Sabula, identified himself as the man who shouted. He said he had \"no regrets\" about what he did. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sabula reportedly said he his remarks referred to Trump's handling of the Epstein files. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has faced pressure for more transparency on what was uncovered by federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein, the late convicted sex offender.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump signed a law that compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release all the files that it held on Epstein by 19 December, although only a fraction of the files have so far been made public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was once friends with Epstein before they fell out, which Trump says was years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">United Automotive Workers (UAW), the union that represents Sabula, defended his actions, saying: \"He believes in freedom of speech, a principle we wholeheartedly embrace, and we stand with our membership in protecting their voice on the job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was in Detroit on Tuesday to give a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's public use of expletives have attracted headlines in the past - for example, when discussing the relationship between Iran and Israel last June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His predecessor Joe Biden also caused controversy for uttering an expletive during a conversation with a worker during his own visit to a factory in Detroit while on the campaign trail in 2020, before he was elected president. </p></div></div></body></html>"

They took her phone, a work and personal computer and a Garmin watch, the outlet said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Natanson was told she was not the focus of the probe, according to the Washington Post, which reported that officials were investigating Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a system administrator in Maryland with top-secret security clearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an FBI affidavit, Perez-Lugones -  a systems engineer and information technology specialist on contract for the government since 2002 - accessed and printed classified intelligence reports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said they found classified information in a lunch box while searching Perez-Lugones' car, according to court filings. The filing does not mention Perez-Lugones disseminating the information. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court filings say Perez-Lugones has been charged with unlawful retention of national defence information. He is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi said the Trump administration would \"not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation's national security and the brave men and women who are serving our country\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The search of Natanson's home sparked concerns from press freedom and free speech advocates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any search targeting a journalist warrants intense scrutiny because these kinds of searches can deter and impede reporting that is vital to our democracy,\" Jameel Jaffer, the executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Natanson previously wrote about her experience gathering more than 1,000 sources who currently and formerly worked for the federal government, as she reported on the layoffs, buyouts and firings that Trump has used since returning to office to shrink the federal workforce and change the focus of many agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Natanson wrote about sources inside government agencies sharing information they \"weren't supposed to tell me\" and the intensity of receiving sensitive information from so many people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In April, Bondi ended Biden-era policies that had protected journalists from having their phone records seized or being forced to testify in leak probes. </p></div></div></body></html>"

I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes,\" said Byabakama. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Yoweri Museveni, 81, who has ruled the country for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is Museveni's main challenger, seeking to unseat him for the second time after finishing runner-up in 2021 polls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six other candidates are also in the race, in which about 21.6 million voters are registered to vote.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Campaigning has been marked by the disruption of opposition activities, including the detention of activists and the breaking-up of rallies by police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Electoral Commission headquarters in the capital, Kampala, Byabakama said he was not worried about threats from what he called \"idle people\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can see from my demeanour that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary,\" said  the poll chief, adding that only the will of voters and the law would guide the process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the video shared by the Daily Monitor newspaper on social media last week, Yiga Kisakyamukama, the special presidential assistant for service delivery and monitoring, was captured saying Museveni would never leave power through the ballot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Don't expect, don't even think, that Simon Byabakama would announce Bobi Wine. President Museveni, who is on the chair, will remain on the chair. Never think that Museveni would leave power through voting. No, no, no - don't waste our time,\" Kisakyamukama was heard saying. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Byabakama said Uganda's law, not individual opinions or threats, would determine the outcome of the presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda. It is the voters who determine how many votes a candidate gets. What the voters have said is what I will declare to the nation,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The poll chief said he would declare the results within 48 hours of the close of polling, in accordance with the country's laws. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to concerns about the heavy military presence in the streets, Byabakama said security forces were deployed to maintain peace and stability during the electoral process and should not intimidate voters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also acknowledged opposition concerns about some polling stations being located within military premises, saying the commission was investigating the reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we find that it is true, we shall take the necessary measures to address it,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the authorities <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cevn0ejynj7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country</a> in order to curb \"misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The network outage has heightened concerns about repression in the run-up to the  vote, and has been described by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

The window will remain open until mid-March. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If chosen, fans will be notified via email and will be given a time slot to purchase tickets in April. One million of those tickets will sell for $28, and about one-third are set to cost less than $100 (£74.41).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These Games belong to everyone,\" Casey Wasserman, the chairman of LA 2028 said on Tuesday. \"These Games have to be affordable and inclusive.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement of affordable ticket prices come after the price of tickets for the 2026 men's football World Cup - which will also be hosted in the US, as well as Canada and Mexico - received some public criticism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, LA officials said affordability and accessibility were central to their ticketing plan - and their hope that sport fans around the globe would be able to attend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tickets for the 2024 Olympics in Paris started at $27.95 (£21).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A special early purchase window will also be open for residents in the Los Angeles area and Oklahoma City, where some Olympic Games are also being held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">2028 will be the first time the Olympics will be held in the US since the 1996 Games in Atlanta. Los Angeles has twice hosted the Olympics - in 1932 and 1984 - and plans to use its already established infrastructure to host the Games. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Event organisers, along with hundreds of Olympians and Paralympians, gathered at the LA Memorial Coliseum on Tuesday for a ceremonial lighting of the Olympic venue's cauldron ahead of the opening of ticket registration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Coliseum hosted events on both the previous occasions that the Olympics were held in LA, and it is set to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/articles/cvg5deg250yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">co-host the opening ceremony</a> along with track and field events in 2028. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Organisers at the event on Tuesday explained how the ticketing would work. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once registered - using their name, email and zip code - fans will be entered into the random draw for time slots to buy tickets in April. The earlier slot a fan is given, the better their chances at securing tickets - as being given a time slot does not guarantee that there will be tickets available once a time slot is open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first set of tickets will be up for purchase from 9-19 April. Admission for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Games will be among the tickets on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the Games will be held across Los Angeles and southern California, but both canoeing and softball will be held in Oklahoma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">LA28 chief Allison Katz-Mayfield called the random ticket-drawing process \"the fairest way to ensure that the broadest number of people can get access to tickets and that no one is advantaged or disadvantaged\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter when you go in, whether you're the first person in or the last person in, you have the same opportunity,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://next.tickets.la28.org/?c=web&amp;e=la28q00260110&amp;ver=javascript-4.4.3&amp;cver=1768287843&amp;man=WEB%20%2F%20LA28-Q0&amp;enqueuetoken=eyJ0eXAiOiJRVDEiLCJlbmMiOiJBRVMyNTYiLCJpc3MiOjE3NjgzNjExODQ3NDMsInRpIjoiNjY5MzVlNmEtMGMxYi00YTI3LTgyZjItN2JmZWNhNzgxMzI3IiwiYyI6IndlYiIsImUiOiJsYTI4cTAwMjYwMTEwIiwiaXAiOiIxMDQuNTQuMzMuNzcifQ.K3aMsWa6tHSlTKLSduLAxQ.y-3s_XYXQ2nAOtSaQUm0TUuGV5x5fyBANy5nmx4Uc4Q&amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Ftickets.la28.org%2F&amp;kupver=akamai-4.4.3\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Registration for tickets</a> will be open until 18 March, and there is no advantage to registering early.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation.

Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

An Iranian official previously told Reuters 2,000 people have been killed but claimed \"terrorists\" were to blame.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A black body bag shows the date of birth of a 16-year-old victim</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/videos/c2e134xz2rjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BBC Verify and BBC Persian have previously reported</a> on images emerging from this mortuary but we are not showing these new videos because the images are too graphic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The footage was posted on Tuesday by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist, who said they were filmed on 10 January inside the Kahrizak Forensic Medical Centre in south Tehran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vahid said the videos were filmed by a man who had travelled nearly 1,000km to find internet access. The man told BBC Persian he used mobile networks from neighbouring countries to upload the footage. Vahid has been posting dozens of videos documenting events inside the country for the outside world to see. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two of the videos show rows of body bags on the floor as the man walks up and down a road that runs through the northern section of the vast mortuary complex. He later moves through a courtyard and inside a large warehouse, and walks in and out of adjacent rooms filled with more body bags. At one point he is heard describing the scene as \"the apocalypse\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The man filming is heard saying, \"Today is Saturday, a day after the call\". He is referring to the call made by Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah, for nationwide protests that took place last Thursday and Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two more clips contain a collection of photos taken from the mortuary showing several bodies wrapped in the zip-up bags, including one which appears burnt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in the five-minute video and at least 178 bodies in the 16-minute clip. The two videos likely show some of the same bodies so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The videos contain at least nine separate clips edited together. The positions of shadows in the footage indicate these sections were likely filmed at different times throughout the day. We have matched identifiable features from the complex, including separate buildings, the red roof of a warehouse and fences with satellite images on Google.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The man films as he moves around inside the centre, where more bodies are kept on stretchers as well as the floor. The footage shows some body bags fully zipped up while others are either half or entirely unzipped, revealing victims' faces and injuries. Some are completely uncovered. We can see blood-soaked towels and sheets scattered around the complex with streaks of blood on the floor.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Body bags laid outside in the courtyard of the mortuary complex</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of the bodies have visible wounds. Two bodies appear to be soaked in blood, and another is seen with a deep stomach wound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some body bags have papers attached to them or details written on the body bags in a white marker such as a name, national ID number, date of birth and death, and in some cases their father's name. At least two men are described as unidentified on a sheet of paper attached to their bag, and at least one woman and one teenager are among the victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The date of death on three of the male victims' body bags states 9 January. Another body bag shows a date of birth using the Iranian calendar. It says 1/1/1388, which corresponds to 21/3/2009, indicating that it belongs to a 16-year-old.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During one moment in the 16-minute clip the man points his phone at a building to his right and a voice can be heard saying: \"There are many [bodies] inside. It's not possible to go inside… this is the women's area\". Iranian mortuaries separate the bodies of men and women for religious reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a different point we can see a body bag at the back of a hearse and a man nearby is heard telling a female official that it is his sister.  </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Verifying Iran protest footage as internet blackout passes 100 hours</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several ambulances, hearses and vans are filmed around the grounds. Officials are seen inspecting the rows of bodies, taking swabs from the victims, and talking to potential loved ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear why the bodies of those killed in anti-government protests may have been transferred to the centre, but eyewitness accounts provided to BBC Persian suggest hospitals have been overwhelmed with the number of casualties in the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">HRANA, which has been tracking the death toll since the unrest began, has reported that 2,403 protesters, 147 people affiliated with the government, nine civilians and 12 children have been killed so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crowds of people, many who appear to be family members and friends, are seen walking in and out of the complex as they try to identify the bodies. Cries and wails are repeatedly heard throughout the videos as people mourn the loss of their loves ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our best people have been killed,\" the man filming is heard saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian state TV has since reported that a \"substantial\" number of bodies had been taken to the mortuary. It claimed the majority of the victims were members of Iran's security forces or passers-by who had nothing to do with the demonstrations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most international news organisation, including the BBC, are restricted from operating inside the country so we have to rely on verifying footage on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-roja-assadi-and-richard-irvine-brown\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Roja Assadi and Richard Irvine-Brown</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This has alarmed neighbouring Manitoba, where a Crown Royal distillery is a key employer in the small town of Gimli.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a symbolic visit to the Gimli distillery on Tuesday, Manitoba Premier Wab Kinew urged Ford to \"do a 180\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ford has not signalled he will reverse course, but in an interview with the BBC on Wednesday, Kinew said he remains \"optimistic\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I know he's definitely talked himself into a position, but at the same time, it's not too late to do the right thing,\" Kinew said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The row over Crown Royal – a Canadian whisky brand that was introduced during the 1939 royal tour of Canada by King George VI – dates back to August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's when Diageo first announced it would close its Amherstburg, Ontario, bottling facility after five decades of operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK-based company said last summer it planned to close the plant in February as part of a broader restructuring to improve its North American supply chain, and – to Ford's dismay – move bottling operations closer to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Here's what I think about Crown Royal,\" he said shortly after Diageo's announcement, before pouring an entire bottle of the whisky on the ground during a news conference and calling Diageo owners \"dumb as a bag of hammers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then vowed to \"hurt\" the firm and urged Canadians to boycott the product.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company has said bottling operations for Canada and non-US markets are set to move to a Quebec facility southwest of Montreal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it has not said it will shift any operations to the US, Ford has speculated that they will. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's all going to Alabama,\" he said earlier this month. \"Mark my words.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ford also vowed to remove the whisky from the shelves in Ontario, where liquor stores are operated by the province. The Liquor Board of Ontario is the largest wholesale purchaser of alcohol in North America. Crown Royal is its top selling whisky, according to Diageo. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Manitoba is now pleading with Ford to change his mind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Crown Royal distillery plant is a major driver for business in the town of Gimli, home to about 2,300 people, Premier Kinew said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He warned Ford that he could inadvertently hurt Canadians with the boycott. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diageo employs more than 500 people across Canada, the company told the BBC, including 100 in Ontario separate from those working at the Amherstburg site.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let's not take action that would harm other Canadian workers, and let's focus on being united,\" Kinew said, noting that Canada \"has no shortage of economic challenges\" with the tariffs it is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27pe8ekpdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">facing from the US and China.</a> </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch from 2025: Ontario Premier Doug Ford dumps whisky in protest</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicknamed \"Captain Canada\" by some, Ford has built a reputation for being combative against US tariffs and the job losses they have been linked to in Ontario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ford notably led a charge to remove US liquor from Canadian stores in retaliation for the levies - a move that has since become a trade irritant for the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has often appeared on major US networks to make the case for free trade between the two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, an anti-tariff advertisement commissioned by the province that ran on American TV caused Trump to abruptly halt trade talks with Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Ford's reaction to Diageo has been applauded by the local union, which says it represents more than 200 workers at the Amherstburg plant whose future is now uncertain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is how you fight a trade war,\" Unifor National President Lana Payne said in September, after Ford first called for a boycott.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the United Food &amp; Commercial Workers, the union representing Diageo workers outside Ontario, criticised Ford for \"stunts\" that it says \"are directly attacking the livelihoods of hundreds of Canadian workers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kinew, who enjoys the highest approval rating of any premier in Canada, said he recognised Ford was standing up for Ontarians but noted they \"are Canadians, just like the people here in Gimli\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He invited Ford to visit Manitoba to discuss the issue over a weekend ice hockey game between Toronto and Winnipeg. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can settle this thing and just put this episode behind us,\" Kinew said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ford has \"politely declined\" the invite, Kinew told the BBC, but he noted that the two remain on good terms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We'll still find a way to talk to each other, even if we're on different sides of this issue,\" he said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had electricity today for something like four minutes,\" Ihor tells me. \"All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine,\" says Yulia somewhat ironically. \"With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ihor and Yulia say they will leave Kyiv temporarily because of the energy crisis</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The energy crisis is not the only reason to move. Just across the courtyard from their new, temporary home, a recent Russian drone strike hit an apartment block, badly damaging several homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's problems are exacerbated by the fact it has borne so many Russian airstrikes against homes and critical infrastructure installations and, as home to more than three million people, the power shortages impact many people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent Russian attacks against energy installations in the capital and other big cities have had a cumulative effect that is much worse than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Klitschko said strikes on Monday night had caused the worst electrical outage the city had yet seen, and on Tuesday more than 500 residential buildings were still without power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Compared to all previous winters, the situation now is the worst,\" Olena Pavlenko, president of the Kyiv-based think tank DiXi Group, told the Kyiv Independent website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every time it's harder to recover. Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Engineers are working to locate and repair damaged cables</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take years and years.

The eleven-year-old says his home is very cold and there'd recently been no power in the family's apartment for 36 hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recalls with clarity the opening day of the war almost four years ago when he could see bright flashes in the sky - a \"bright orb\" - as Russia launched its attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These days it is the threat of Russian drones that keeps him awake at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I hear something flying it's really scary, because you don't know if it will explode now, or if it will fly on and you survive.\"  As we perch on the top bunk of the carriage where he is sitting with another friend, Stas is frank about the impact of the war on his generation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I forget the times when there was no war, I don't remember those moments – life is difficult,\" says Stas, his smile wide and demeanour remarkably bubbly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are all kinds of people seeking warmth, comfort or company on the train. But my next conversation with an elderly lady, who says her discomfort is nothing compared with what soldiers on the front are enduring, is abruptly cut short as the familiar high-pitched sound of an air raid alert rings out on our phones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conductor orders everyone off the train and directs them to a shelter, about a kilometre away. Most head home instead, to the cold and their interrupted power supplies but all - including Stas and Alina - say they'll be back tomorrow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everyone in Kyiv is putting a brave face on things. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This extraordinarily cold winter, even by Ukrainian standards, will not last for much more than a couple of months and the energy crisis will ease. What most people fear is that, despite some optimism at the end of last year, there is no end in sight to the war itself and the inevitable loss of life.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-firle-davies-and-mariana-matviechuk.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Firle Davies and Mariana Matviechuk.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

As Ernest Hemingway famously said about going broke – gradually then suddenly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protesters in Iran and their supporters abroad were hoping that the Islamic regime in Tehran was at the suddenly stage. The signs are, if it is dying, it is still at gradual.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last two weeks of unrest add up to a big crisis for the regime. Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"West Asia News Agency via Reuters A street scene at night showing protesters gathering around parked cars.

It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Beijing's foreign ministry said the two countries have \"shared interests\" and should work to \"increase people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Carney meets the Premier of China, Li Qiang, as well as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, the prime minister is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping one-on-one, after the pair met last year on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This official visit is a significant step in the rapprochement after Canada-China relations hit a low in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US warrant on fraud charges related to Iran sanctions violations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The detention in Canada of the executive of a Chinese telecom giant angered Beijing, and China subsequently arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All three were released in 2021 after Meng cut a deal with US prosecutors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has been accused of meddling in Canada's politics, though a public inquiry on foreign interference found its impact in recent federal elections to be minimal. China has repeatedly denied allegations of foreign meddling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have struggled to forge meaningful ties in the past. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng#a2_1_1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Ottawa views China as \"an increasingly disruptive global power\" </a> that \"increasingly disregards\" international rules and norms, though it recognises China's size and influence make some cooperation necessary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Carney government does not see this upcoming visit as a deviation from that view, senior Canadian government officials told reporters this week. But they added that Canada cannot achieve its objective of reducing economic reliance on the US without increasing trade with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney is said to be approaching talks with an eye on increasing collaboration in areas of mutual interest like energy and climate, and putting guardrails on areas where the two countries clash, like defence and critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we are approaching the relationship now with the realism that we haven't seen for decades,\" Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson added that it could result in a \"healthier relationship if both sides understand where they're coming from and what the red lines are\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has already proven to be a careful line to walk. Ahead of Carney's visit, two Liberal MPs cut a sponsored trip to Taiwan short, telling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberal-mps-trip-taiwan-carney-china/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the Globe and Mail newspaper </a>that while Canada's position on Taiwan \"has not changed\", the trip ended early to \"avoid confusion with its foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of Canada's main objectives during this trip is to ease Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola that have hurt farmers in the country's prairie provinces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China last year imposed the agriculture tariffs in a move widely seen as retaliation for Canadian levies on Chinese electric vehicles announced in 2024, mirroring similar levies by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an editorial this week, state-run newspaper Global Times pointed to frustration expressed by Canadian farmers, suggesting \"perhaps this was the heavy price (Canada) paid for blindly following the US\". China has made it clear it wants the tariffs on EVs lifted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For China, Canada is seen as an important trading partner, with trade between the two countries valued at around $118bn in 2024. But crucially for Beijing, if President Xi manages to make a deal with Carney, it would give China more influence in a country that is on America's doorstep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Global Times op-ed called on Ottawa to set a foreign policy path separate from that of the US and to exercise \"strategic autonomy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One big unknown about this visit is how the US would react to any deals struck between Canada and China. Canada's economy has been hit by US tariffs, especially those on its steel, aluminium and automotive sectors. Talks to ease those levies remain on pause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada will soon, however, be engaged in consequential talks on renewing a long-standing North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico that has shielded it from the bulk of Trump's sweeping tariffs. That review is set to be completed later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson, the former diplomat, said it is likely that the Americans are watching the Canada-China relationship \"very closely\", and that Canada is keeping the US \"well informed\" of its intentions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"At the end of the day, there's Canadian interests that we're pursuing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-jessica-murphy-in-toronto.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With additional reporting from Jessica Murphy in Toronto. </i></p></div></div></body></html>"
