And we're working very hard to get it done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An unnamed senior US official told CBS News that the plan \"was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky's administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on X, Zelensky wrote: \"The American side presented points of a plan to end the war—their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it's all genuine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: \"Not that I know of.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" she added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Peskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine and we must never lose sight of that principle underpinning the just and lasting peace that we all want to see.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Hours later, Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 33 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!! LOCK THEM UP???,\" Trump wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The six lawmakers, all of whom have served in the military or intelligence community, called Trump's remarks dangerous and said they amounted to threats against elected officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No threat, intimidation, or call for violence will deter us from that sacred obligation,\" they said in a joint statement.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The video by Democrats, which was shared by Michigan Senator Elissa Slotkin, features Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Representatives Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Jason Crow of Colorado.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sen Kelly, who served in the Navy and is a former astronaut, says: \"Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our constitution,\" the lawmakers say in the video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This administration is pitting our uniformed military and intelligence community professionals against American citizens,\" it says. \"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this Constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The response from Trump on Thursday morning came in a series of posts on Truth Social. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's called SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL. Their words cannot be allowed to stand — We won't have a Country anymore!!! An example MUST BE SET,\" he wrote in one post on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went on to say: \"This is really bad, and Dangerous to our Country. Their words cannot be allowed to stand. SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR FROM TRAITORS!!!

Trump and several others in attendance were injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just this year there have been a number of high-profile incidents, including the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, an arson attack on Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's home, and the killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of Kirk's murder, many conservatives including Trump spoke out against Democrats and said they were responsible for the growing political violence in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene recently spoke out about the increased number of threats she's received since breaking with Trump on some policies. Their feud boiled over last week when Trump posted several times about her, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\". Her son also received a death threat, according to local police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More public officials are reporting swatting - making prank calls to emergency services to deploy a Special Weapons and Tactics team (Swat) - attempts in recent months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That includes an Indiana Republican who was the focus of a separate Truth Social attack from the president, over his stance on redistricting in the state. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment.

On TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities.

women's rights groups are calling for nationwide protests to demand that gender-based violence (GBV) be declared a national disaster in a country where attacks on women have become commonplace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The campaign began with a viral social media movement and will culminate in a nationwide \"shutdown\" on Friday, ahead of the G20 Summit in Johannesburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Celebrities, citizens and nations have shown their solidarity by changing their social media profile pictures to purple – a colour often linked to GBV awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa experiences some of the world's highest levels of GBV, with the rate at which women are killed five times higher than the global average, according to UN Women.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Between January and March this year, 137 women were murdered and more than 1,000 raped, according to South African crime statistics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><b id=\"warning:-this-report-contains-descriptions-of-sexual-assault\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Warning: This report contains descriptions of sexual assault</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, women are being urged to refrain from going to work or school, \"withdraw from the economy for one day\", and lie down for 15 minutes at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) in honour of the women murdered in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are also being urged to wear black as a sign of \"mourning and resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protest, dubbed the G20 Women's Shutdown, has been organised by Women for Change, which has also been spearheading the online campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has also been an online petition, signed by over one million people, calling for the government to take an even tougher stance against the scourge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) has rejected the calls to declare GBV a national disaster, saying it doesn't fall within the legal requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa told the G20 Social Summit that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-49739977\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">South Africa had \"declared gender-based violence and femicide a national crisis\" in 2019</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, activists say that little has changed and they want the government to take more action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women for Change spokesperson Cameron Kasambala lamented the enactment of \"so many beautiful acts and legislations\" over the years to try and tackle the issue, which are followed by \"lack of implementation and transparency\" on the government's part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've integrated violence… into our culture [and] into our social norms,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once the government truly reacts to this issue, I feel like we'll already be able to see a reaction on the ground. Because they set the precedent and the tone for how the country responds,\" she said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grammy-award winning singer Tyla is among the thousands of celebrities and citizens who have rallied behind the call and changed their social media profiles. Some have gone further, posting pictures of purple hearts, nail polish and even clothing in what has since been dubbed the \"purple movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South African professor who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC she had taken leave so she could travel to Johannesburg from Free State province to take part in the silent protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's important for her because she said she had second thoughts about simple things like jogging and hopes that the protest will \"slow the scourge\" of GBV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, some women have faced a backlash from employers for wanting to participate in the protest. One product designer who works for a major cooperation said they were strongly advised against taking part. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some women who feel the government is not doing enough have taken matters into their own hands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lynette Oxeley founded Girls on Fire to help women protect themselves through gun ownership.  It is legal to own a firearm in South Africa for self-defence if a person has a valid licence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the women in her group have been raped, attacked, robbed, or experienced some level of violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prudence joined the group after she was raped in 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I said: 'No'. I screamed, I cried but he didn't take no for an answer,\" she told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trying to find justice was an \"uphill battle\" as her case was withdrawn because her rape kit - the DNA they take after the crime - was lost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It isn't a \"police problem, it is a nation problem,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the women are trained to shoot firearms, Ms Oxeley said using a gun was a \"last resort\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about actually defending yourself with a firearm. I want ladies to change what they think about themselves. Stop being silent,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if you do not win the fight, at least you are fighting back.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A growing number of women in South Africa are learning to use guns to protect themselves</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More about South Africa from the BBC:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

owned by Amazon -has been included as its main purpose was \"online social interaction\" where users were encouraged to chat to each other about posted content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Twitch spokesperson said Australians under 16 will not be able to open a Twitch account from 10 December, and from 9 January, existing under-16s accounts will be deactivated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On her reasons why Twitch had been included, eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"a platform most commonly used for livestreaming or posting content that enables users, including Australian children, to interact with others in relation to the content posted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No more platforms are expected to be added to the ban before the start date next month, Ms Inman Grant said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has previously said the ban is aimed at <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reducing the \"pressures and risks\" children can be exposed to on social media, including harmful content</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Founded in 2007, Twitch is a popular livestreaming platform, where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, it launched <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-68069397\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plans to share more of its revenue with creators</a> as part of a shake-up, allowing streamers to make money through fans subscribing to their channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The revenue is split equally between Twitch and the creator, after fees are paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twitch's policy forbids anyone under 13 to use its platform and users aged between 13 and the legal age of adulthood in their country can join if they have permission from their parent or guardian.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Inman Grant also said on Friday that Pinterest, where users compile online notice boards of images, would not be included in the ban because its core purpose was not about online social interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the platform was \"more commonly used by individuals collating images for inspiration and idea curation,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia's world-first under-16s social media ban also includes YouTube, Reddit, Kick, Threads and X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban means tech companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to stop under-16s from using their platforms or risk being fined up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Meta - which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz919xyx7weo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announced it would start closing accounts of teenagers under 16</a> from 4 December, a week before the official ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not clear how companies will enforce the ban but some possibilities included the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference. The latter of these uses online information other than a date of birth - such as online behaviour or interactions - to estimate a person's age.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, it can withhold files that relate to active criminal investigations or are deemed to invade personal privacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a major reversal, Trump dropped his opposition to the measure last weekend,  after pushback from Epstein's victims and members of his own Republican Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With his support, the resolution overwhelmingly cleared both chambers of Congress.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, Trump had dismissed the need to release the documents, calling it a Democrat-led \"hoax\" to \"deflect\" attention away from his party's work. That position was itself a change from the stance he took ahead of the 2024 election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Perhaps the truth about these Democrats, and their associations with Jeffrey Epstein, will soon be revealed, because I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although a congressional vote was not required to release the files - Trump could have ordered the release on his own - lawmakers in the House passed the legislation with a 427-1 vote. The Senate gave unanimous consent to pass it upon its arrival, sending the bill to Trump for his signature. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lone vote against the resolution in the House, the lower chamber, was cast by Louisiana Republican Clay Higgins, who objected to the scope of information that could be released. He said it could reveal and threaten \"thousands of innocent people\" who may have talked to investigators about allegations against Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the law now signed by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi must release the documents within 30 days.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files subject to release are from criminal investigations into Epstein, including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items seized in raids of his properties. Those materials include internal justice department communications, flight logs, and people and entities connected to the late financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are exceptions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The resolution allows the justice department to withhold any documents related to criminal investigations. After the estate documents were released last week, Trump said he would ask Bondi to investigate Epstein's ties to people who had apparently communicated with him. Bondi promptly said the justice department \"will pursue this with urgency and integrity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the bill's architects, Republican Congressman Thomas Massie, said he had worries that the move would lead to some federal files being withheld.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm concerned that [Trump is] opening a flurry of investigations, and I believe they may be trying to use those investigations as a predicate for not releasing the files. That's my concern,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi can also withhold information that may identify victims or reveal their medical files, leading many to speculate that parts of the files will be redacted - although it remains unclear how heavy the redacting could be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm glad in the act itself they put specific language reinforcing the privacy rights of the victims here,\" said Christine Dunn, an attorney with Sanford Heisler Sharp McKnight who specialises in sexual violence and victims' rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's important to make sure that their privacy is protected and to avoid retraumatizing these victims,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">White House: Epstein story 'a manufactured hoax'</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had promised during his 2024 presidential campaign to make the files public, and early in the year his administration released thousands of pages of documents from the Epstein investigation, mostly flight logs. While Trump said more documents were coming, Bondi later announced in July there would be no further releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That prompted lawmakers from both parties to introduce the resolution compelling the files' release. One of the resolution's key proponents was Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump's fiercest political allies. She has publicly fought with Trump in recent weeks, as the US president maintained his opposition to the resolution up to a few days before the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the resolution passed, Greene posted to say that she would read the name of any powerful person implicated in any released files aloud on the House floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The anticipated files are different to the more than 20,000 pages of documents from Epstein's estate released by Congress last week, including some that mention Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those include 2018 messages from Epstein in which he said of Trump: \"I am the one able to take him down\" and \"I know how dirty donald is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters on Monday night, Trump said Republicans had \"nothing to do with Epstein\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's really a Democrat problem,\" he said. \"The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family of Virginia Giuffre, who <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cql67qk0dd3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">died by suicide earlier this year</a>, said in a statement Trump signing the bill was \"nothing short of monumental\", for Giuffre and other survivors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As we look towards the next chapter, we remain vigilant. This work is not finished. Every name must be revealed, regardless of power, wealth, or party affiliation,\" her brother and sister-in-law, Sky and Amanda Roberts, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Epstein was found dead in 2019 in his New York prison cell in what a coroner ruled was a suicide. He was being held on charges of sex trafficking. He had been convicted previously of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The once high-flying financier had ties with a number of high-profile figures, including Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the brother of King Charles and former prince; Trump; Trump's former advisor Steve Bannon; and a cast of other characters from the world of media, politics and entertainment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, former Harvard president <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce868dmz2mdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Larry Summers took a leave</a> from teaching at the university while the school investigated his links to Epstein, revealed in a series of chummy email exchanges.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"kayla-epstein-contributed-to-this-report.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Kayla Epstein contributed to this report.</i></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Moment House passes bill to release Epstein files</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that those arrested are criminals and gang members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But local lawmakers and residents have railed against the detainments, which the federal government has dubbed \"Operation Charlotte's Web\". The state's Democratic governor has alleged people are being targeted because of their race. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement released on Wednesday, a DHS spokesperson said the operation has led to the arrest of \"some of the most dangerous criminal illegal aliens\", including gang members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others arrested had been convicted of a range of crimes, including assault on law enforcement, driving while intoxicated, theft and tampering with government documents, the department said earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Carolina's Democratic Governor Josh Stein, who has denounced Trump's operations, accused agents of racially profiling residents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've seen masked, heavily armed agents in paramilitary garb driving unmarked cars, targeting American citizens based on their skin colour, racially profiling and picking up random people in parking lots,\" Stein said on Sunday. \"This is not making us safer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's mayor, also a Democrat, urged federal agents to operate with \"respect\" for the city's values. She also commended those who came out in droves on Saturday to protest the Trump administration's actions in the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am deeply concerned with many of the videos I've seen,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said. \"To everyone in Charlotte who is feeling anxious or fearful: you are not alone. Your city stands with you.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS has not said how long the raids will last. Chicago's crackdown started in September and is still ongoing. Like other cities subject to immigration crackdowns, some migrants in Charlotte are staying home for fear of federal agents in the city, according to local media reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stein says he's monitoring reports that the operation will come to Raleigh, another North Carolina city, next. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once again, I call on federal agents to target violent criminals, not neighbors walking down the street, going to church, or putting up Christmas decorations,\" he wrote.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He must also pay €10,000 to Mr González Amador as compensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trial of García Ortiz fuelled already acrimonious relations between the left-wing government of Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and right-wing opposition.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their contrasting positions were underlined by reactions to the conviction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sánchez must apologise to Spaniards, resign and call elections, in that order,\" said Ester Muñoz, spokeswoman for the conservative People's Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government said it did not agree with the ruling but respected it and would proceed with the appointment of a new attorney general.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a number of politicians on the left expressed outrage at what they saw as a politically motivated ruling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health Minister Mónica García, of the Sumar party, said the conviction dealt a \"lethal blow to [the concept of] presumption of innocence\" and threw ordinary Spaniards \"under the bus\" when it came to the rule of law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The complex case dates back to March 2024, when the attorney general's office issued a press release stating that Mr González Amador had requested a plea bargain after being found to have evaded tax payments worth €350,951. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The document corrected mistaken press reports stating that the attorney general's office had proposed the bargain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The source of the incorrect reports was the head of communications of the conservative regional president of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso. Ms Díaz Ayuso is the partner of Mr González Amador.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr González Amador filed a complaint against the attorney general, claiming his privacy had been breached. The case against García Ortiz also saw him accused of leaking information about the affair to the media. Prosecutors pointed to the attorney general's decision to change his phone as incriminating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there was no direct evidence linking García Ortiz to the leak and several journalists testified during the trial that he had not been the source of their information. Regarding the press statement, the attorney general said he was simply correcting the erroneous reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">García Ortiz can appeal against the ruling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes as a severe blow for the prime minister, who has been under judicial pressure on various fronts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His brother is due to go on trial for influence peddling, his wife is under investigation for her business activities and two former senior figures in the Socialist Party, José Luis Ábalos and Santos Cerdán, are accused of overseeing a massive kickback scheme.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks marked a sharp escalation after several days of relative calm, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Civil Defence reported that the strike in Zeitoun caused severe damage to the religious endowments ministry's building and surrounding structures, and posted a video showing its rescue workers appearing to find two people buried

No IDF injuries were reported,\" it added. \"In response, the IDF began striking Hamas terrorist targets across the Gaza Strip.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli public broadcaster Kan cited a security source as saying the targets of the strikes were the commander of the Zeitoun Battalion of Hamas's military wing, the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and the commander of its naval force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas denounced the Israeli strikes, saying in a statement that it considered them a \"dangerous escalation through which the war criminal [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu seeks to resume the genocide against our people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also urged the US to \"honour its stated commitments and exert immediate pressure on Israel to enforce the ceasefire and halt its attacks\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a US official told Reuters news agency that Hamas was aiming to break the ceasefire and not fulfil its commitment to disarm.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the UN Security Council passed a resolution that sought to shore up the fragile ceasefire, which took effect on 10 October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Member states authorised the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace, which will be chaired by President Trump, and a temporary International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with ensuring \"the process of demilitarizing the Gaza Strip\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump hailed the resolution as \"a moment of true historic proportion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas reiterated that it would not give up its weapons without a Palestinian state, arguing its fight against Israel was legitimate \"resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's ambassador to the UN stressed the importance of disarmament, saying that his country would \"not stop or let up\" until Hamas no longer presented \"a threat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military has said three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks in Gaza since the ceasefire began and that its has targeted scores of fighters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday afternoon, Israel's military also carried out several strikes in southern Lebanon saying it targeted weapons storage facilities belonging to Hezbollah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel accuses the Iran-backed armed group of trying to rebuild its capabilities following a war that ended last November.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The prosecution had called for the death penalty but Judge James Omotosho said that executions were now \"frowned upon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his ruling he said he was satisfied that Kanu had made a series of broadcasts to incite violence and killings, as part of his campaign for a separate state in south-east Nigeria, known as Biafra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kanu was convicted on all seven charges he faced.

This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What platforms are affected?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">have recently introduced age checks</a> on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria.

These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How have social media companies responded?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6567/live/8b3ba220-c5e1-11f0-bca0-d197f0674a9d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images The YouTube brand on the side of a building, with a sign in the shape of the YouTube logo jutting out from the same building\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Though included in the ban, YouTube has denied being a social media company</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even as it announced that it would implement it early, Meta argued the ban would leave teens with \"inconsistent protections across the many apps they use\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At parliamentary hearings in October, TikTok and Snap said they still opposed the ban but would implement it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kick - the only Australian company included in the ban - has said it will introduce a \"range of measures\" and continue to engage \"constructively\" with authorities.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Do other countries have similar bans?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban on under-16s using social media is a world first, and other countries will be watching closely. Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epennv98lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new safety rules</a> introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjep23403o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">French parliamentary enquiry</a> recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will children try to get around the ban?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents.

He escaped a heavy jail sentence as a result of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eleven years later, he was charged with running a network of underage girls for sex. He died in prison while awaiting trial and his death was ruled a suicide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These two criminal investigations amassed a vast trove of documents including transcripts of interviews with victims and witnesses, and items confiscated from raids on his various properties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found over 300 gigabytes of data and physical evidence in its databases, hard drives and other storage, according to a 2025 memo from the justice department. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While some of the files likely include materials gathered by prosecutors working at federal level and Florida state level to investigate Epstein, the justice department says there is a \"large volume\" of images and videos of victims and other illegal child abuse material. These files would not be released to the public, as the latest legislation passed by Congress allows the justice department to withhold information that identifies victims. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also a separate investigation into his British co-conspirator and ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to traffic girls for sex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Epstein and Maxwell were also the subject of civil cases.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"It's exhausting\" - Epstein accuser talks to the BBC about files saga</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What has already been released on Epstein?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At various stages over the years, some materials have been put into the public domain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, thousands of documents belonging to the Epstein estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was not the first tranche released by the House Oversight Committee since it subpoenaed Epstein's estate earlier in the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier release, in September, included a birthday book containing a note to Epstein bearing Trump's name, which he has denied writing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In February, weeks after Trump took office, the Department of Justice and the FBI released what they described at the time as the \"first phase of the declassified Epstein files\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group of right-wing influencers were invited to the White House, but they were left disappointed when they realised that the 341 pages handed to them were mostly material already out there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It included flight logs from Epstein's plane and a redacted version of his contacts book containing the names of famous people he knew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, the Department of Justice and FBI said in a memo that no more material would be released. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is now poised to change.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happens now that Trump has approved release?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vote in the House of Representatives was forced by a discharge petition getting its critical 218th signature to trigger action on the floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four Republicans and all 214 Democrats in the House signed the petition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c20r07dg6kro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The vote</a> to release the files took place on 18 November and the bill passed 427-to-1 in the House.

Mr Musk has been quoted as saying that Epstein invited him to the island but he declined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest batch of emails belonging to the Epstein estate and released on 12 November also featured Clinton's former Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, and Trump's former aide Steve Bannon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Summers later said he would be stepping back from public commitments, writing in a statement: \"I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's name was also mentioned several times in that latest release.

Flight logs also showed Trump flying on Epstein's plane on several occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were pictured together at elite events in the 1990s, and photos published by CNN purport to show Epstein in attendance at Trump's wedding to then-wife Marla Maples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2002, Trump described Epstein as a \"terrific guy\". Epstein would later remark: \"I was Donald's closest friend for 10 years.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Trump, they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. By 2008, Trump was saying that he had not been \"a fan of his\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that \"the president kicked him out of his club for being a creep\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Washington Post, meanwhile, has suggested that the breakdown in their relationship was due to their rivalry over some real estate in Florida.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why are people so interested in Epstein?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Die-hard members of Trump's MAGA movement have long believed officials are hiding key truths about Epstein's life and death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of them have theorised that a child-molesting cabal has been operating at the highest levels of US society, protected by the state. The theory spread through cryptic messages posted by a pseudonymous character called Q.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one of the conspiracy theories pushed by some MAGA influencers, Epstein was an agent of the Israeli government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Trump allies have tried to quell the backlash. Last month, the Republican-controlled House announced an early recess for the chamber, stalling efforts to force the release of Epstein-related documents within 30 days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are several unanswered questions about Epstein shared by the wider population too - particularly why he was given such a lenient sentence in Florida, whether he and Maxwell were really acting alone, and how he was allowed to take his own life in prison.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Elections are due early next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fallout from all this has created a diplomatic bind: Dhaka wants Hasina extradited, but Delhi has shown no inclination to comply - making her death sentence effectively unenforceable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What Delhi intended as humanitarian asylum is turning into a long and uncomfortable test of how far it is willing to go for an old ally, and how much diplomatic capital it is prepared to burn in the process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael Kugelman, a South Asia expert, says India faces four unappealing options. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It could hand Hasina over - \"which it really doesn't want to do\". It could maintain the status quo, though that will become \"increasingly risky for Delhi once a newly elected government takes office next year\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Or, it could press Hasina to stay silent and avoid <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz6xqyzzdxgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">statements </a>or <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lq1e1d79lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">interviews</a>, something she is \"unlikely to accept\" as she continues to lead her Awami League party - and something Delhi is unlikely to enforce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remaining option is to find a third country to take her in, but that too is fraught: few governments are likely to accept a \"high-maintenance guest with serious legal problems and security needs\", Mr Kugelman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extraditing Hasina is unthinkable - India's ruling party and opposition alike view her as a close friend. \"India prides itself on not turning on its friends,\" according to Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What makes this moment especially awkward for Delhi is the sheer depth - and asymmetry - of the India–Bangladesh relationship, rooted in India's pivotal role in Bangladesh's birth.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bdc2/live/2f18c790-c53f-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A student-led uprising forced toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A student-led uprising toppled Hasina, forcing her to flee Bangladesh last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, and India has become Bangladesh's largest export market in Asia. Total trade reached nearly $13bn (£10bn) last year, with Bangladesh running a sizeable deficit, heavily dependent on Indian raw materials, energy and transit routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has offered $8bn-$10bn in concessional credit over the past decade, provides duty-free access to some goods, built cross-border rail links, and supplies electricity - plus oil and LNG - from Indian grids and ports. This is not a relationship either side can easily walk away from.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India and Bangladesh share a complex interdependence - relying on each other for water, electricity and more. It would be difficult for Bangladesh to function without India's co-operation,\" says Sanjay Bhardwaj, a professor of South Asian studies at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, many believe, Bangladesh's interim government, under Yunus, appears to now be moving quickly to rebalance its external ties. His first months in office have been a burst of diplomatic outreach aimed at \"de-Indianising\" Bangladesh's foreign policy, according to political scientist Bian Sai in a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.isas.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ISAS-Insights-761.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">paper</a> published by the National University of Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A government that once aligned itself with India at every regional forum is now cancelling judicial exchanges, renegotiating Indian energy deals, slowing India-led connectivity projects, and leaning publicly on Beijing, Islamabad and even Ankara for strategic partnership. Many believe the message could not be clearer: Bangladesh, once India's most dependable neighbour, is hedging hard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deterioration is already visible in public sentiment. A recent <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/650b87725caa\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">survey</a> by the Dhaka-based Centre for Alternatives found more than 75% of Bangladeshis viewed ties with Beijing positively, compared with just 11% for Delhi - reflecting sentiments after last year's uprising. Many blame Delhi for supporting an increasingly authoritarian Hasina in her final years, and see India as an overbearing neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bharadwaj says that long-standing economic and cultural ties often endure beyond political shifts: data show that trade between India and Bangladesh grew between 2001 and 2006, when the \"less friendlier\" Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in coalition with Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), was in power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While diplomatic and political relations often fluctuate with changes in government, economic, cultural and sports ties tend to remain largely stable. Even if a new administration is less friendly toward India, it does not automatically disrupt trade or broader bilateral relations,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Delhi, the challenge is not just managing a fallen ally in exile, but preserving a neighbour central to its security - from counterterrorism and border management to access to its restive north-eastern region.

OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that \"there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Google would be immune</a> from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: \"I think no company is going to be immune, including us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The big AI surge - and the big risk</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Google's parent firm Alphabet, headquartered in Mountain View, is worth about $3.3 trillion, and has almost doubled in value since April, (which every Googler on campus will no doubt be feeling through the value of their stock options)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&amp;P 500.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these \"inflection points\": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. \"Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as for the big question - is it a bubble?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is \"palpably exciting\" progress of services that people and companies are using. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he concedes: \"It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry…</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sundar Pichai: \"We have this phrase at Google, which is 'uncomfortably exciting'.\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and  complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Restricted': inside the silicon chip lab</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: \"restricted\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Google's TPU cluster is developing the chip that could soon power all its AI searches</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">There are several versions of TPUs: the Ironwood is the latest. The TPUs are part of Sundar Pichai's overall strategy of owning the entire scientific supply chain - from the silicon to the data, plus the AI models and everything in between</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term \"AI factories\" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">(Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Mr Ellison put it: \"I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The chips race - and the OpenAI storm</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done.

Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true,\" he told me. \"Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I put it to him that truth matters.

That is: how on Earth to power it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's possible.

It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about \"irrational exuberance\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4484/live/2750d3e0-c3b9-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage A photo of Larry Page from 2006, co-founder of Google\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Google's co-founder Larry Page helped steer it through the dotcom crash</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.
