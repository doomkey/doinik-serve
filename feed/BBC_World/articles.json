But a senior Russian official said the plan was \"radically different\" to the one Russia was negotiating with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin has not commented on Zelensky's offer to withdraw troops from Ukraine's eastern Donbas region, if Russia pulls back too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday night, at least one person was injured in the Kyiv region in new Russian air strikes, local officials said.

Their most recent meeting at the White House in October was far more amicable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Confirmation of planned top-level talks came after the Ukrainian leader said he had spoken to Trump's chief negotiators, special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, for an hour over the phone on Christmas Day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the latest round of negotiations had <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g413yz9g5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">generated \"new ideas\" on how to end the war</a>, and described it as a \"really good conversation\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has proposed establishing what would in effect be a demilitarised zone in eastern Ukraine where both sides agree not to deploy troops - a compromise that would avoid settling the intractable question of legal ownership over the contested territory. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky signalled on Wednesday that if Ukraine were to pull back by up to 40km (25 miles) from the front line in the east to create an economic zone, then Russia would have to do the same from Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine's industrial heartland in the Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has secured a number of changes to an earlier 28-point draft plan, which was formulated by Witkoff but widely seen as being favourable to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky told reporters on Friday that the weekend talks in Florida would focus on several documents, including US security guarantees and a separate economic agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Zelensky has repeatedly said the question of territory has proved to be the most difficult issue to resolve, along with the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has proposed Ukraine and Russia split the energy generated by the plant, the largest in Europe.

Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused \"groups of states, primarily Western European\" of seeking to derail the diplomatic progress that had been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has repeatedly warned that Ukrainian troops must withdraw from all of Donbas or Russia will seize it, rejecting any compromise over how to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky outlined the latest version of the plan this week, the first time since the original 28-point draft was leaked in November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Latest proposals commit the US and Europe to providing security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5, committing allies to providing military support in the event Russia launches a renewed invasion. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal would also see Ukraine's military maintained at 800,000 personnel, a level the Kremlin has demanded be cut.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Najib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>has maintained his innocence but remains at large.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53563065\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">guilty of embezzlement in 2020.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68137595\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">halved last year</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013.

The Indonesian government then set up a dedicated agency to manage funds and aid projects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone took action and the community recovered quickly after the tsunami. What we're suffering now is worse,\" said Rindu Majalina, who was a high-school student when the tsunami struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mother of three has been struggling to feed her children since the recent floods swallowed their home. Residents \"fight like zombies\" for every bit of supply delivered to her village \"because we are starving\", she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several countries have offered aid. The UAE, for instance, sent 30 tonnes of rice and 300 relief packages to Medan, another city hit by the floods - but it was all sent back by authorities following what they described as \"guidance\" from the central government.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a1fc/live/84208bc0-e0a0-11f0-b2e7-af56b53f54e0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Indonesia President Prabowo Subianto (centre, wearing cream shirt) is surrounded by a crowd of residents during his visit to Aceh Tamiang following the deadly floods\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prabowo Subianto (centre) and his administration have increasingly been criticised as out of touch</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's refusal to accept international aid is his way of asserting authority, said Vidhyandika Djati Perkasa, a senior politics researcher at Indonesia's Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Opening the door to foreign assistance means inviting foreign scrutiny, which they do not want...

norms \"regardless of geopolitical circumstances.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,\" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case.</p><p

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the archaeologist and the Hermitage insist all their finds remain in Crimea as they are transferred to the Eastern Crimean Museum in Kerch. They argue that objects can only be relocated to Russia temporarily for restoration or as exhibition loans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, this violates Ukrainian law too, as all discoveries must go into Ukraine's museum fund. Under the terms of Russia's illegal annexation, the Eastern Crimean Museum collection has instead been made part of Russia's museum fund.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the start of the war, several European courts have refused Ukraine's requests to extradite Russians, citing potential risks under the European Convention, which prohibits politically motivated persecution, violations of the right to a fair trial, and torture and inhuman treatment of detainees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if the Polish court deciding Butyagin's case does find sufficient grounds to extradite him, it might not go ahead, says Gleb Bogush, a researcher at the Institute for International Peace and Security Law at the University of Cologne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last June, Denmark's Supreme Court ruled against extraditing to Ukraine a Russian national suspected of espionage for Moscow.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gleb Bogush says it is primarily the Russian state and its officials that are responsible for Crimean excavations, rather than Butyagin, because it was not up to archaeologists to decide whether the Hermitage expedition should continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior Hermitage employee told the BBC that \"a field archaeologist cannot be a citizen of the world; he deals with officials, obtaining permits and has to look for funding and volunteers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Butyagin has attracted support not just from the Kremlin but from Russians who oppose Putin and the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The claims being made against him are absurd,\" said Arseny Vesnin, an exiled journalist and historian. He said Butyagin had ensured conservation and preservation of the site he was excavating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others maintain that artefacts would have been looted by criminals and sold on the black market if Russian archaeologists had refused to work in Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That does not justify their actions, says Samuel Andrew Hardy, a leading British criminologist specialising in the protection of cultural property in conflict zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official excavations do not always stop criminal digs from taking place, he argues. Some looters target sites that have already been excavated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A cooling tower and chimneys at the NLC Tamil Nadu Power Ltd.

For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/ceew-how-big-is-the-solar-module-recycling-industry-in-india.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">11 million tonnes of solar waste</a> by 2047. Managing this would require almost 300 dedicated recycling facilities and an investment of $478 (£362m) over the next two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most of India's large solar parks were built in the mid-2010s, so the real wave of waste is coming in 10 to 15 years,\" says Rohit Pahwa of energy company Targray.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's solar-waste projections mirror global patterns: the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/end-life-management-solar-photovoltaics\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US</a> may generate 170,000–1 million tonnes and China nearly one million tonnes by 2030, following rapid solar expansion in the 2010s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy landscape, however, differs significantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US, solar-panel recycling is mostly market-driven under a patchwork of state rules. China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials. The BBC has contacted India's renewable energy ministry for comment.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eca7/live/20ed00e0-d5b7-11f0-88d3-f3714d37a458.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images OIDA, INDIA - SEPTEMBER 4: Flood-affected residents on Noida's Pushta Road installed solar panels in their homes to cope with the darkness, on September 4, 2025 in Noida, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Damaged and ageing rooftop panels are rarely recycled</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Solar power gives an illusion of clean energy for two decades, but without a serious plan for recycling panels it risks leaving behind a graveyard of modules and not much of a legacy,\" says environment expert Sai Bhaskar Reddy Nakka.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the challenges, experts say the problem is not without opportunities.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As waste rises, so will the demand for companies that know how to process it,\" Mr Pahwa says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Efficient recycling could reclaim 38% of materials for new panels by 2047 and prevent 37 million tonnes of carbon emissions from mining, says CEEW.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India already has markets for glass and aluminium, and metals found in solar cells - silicon, silver, and copper - can be recovered for new panels or other industries, says Akansha Tyagi, co-author of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently, most solar waste is processed with basic methods that recover only low-value materials like glass and aluminium, while precious metals are lost, damaged or extracted in tiny amounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say the next decade will be decisive for India's solar goals. The country must act fast - building a regulated, self-sustaining recycling system, raising household awareness, and integrating waste collection into solar business models.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies that profit from solar power should also be responsible for what happens to panels once they stop working, says Mr Nakka. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Without proper recycling, clean energy today could mean more waste tomorrow,\" he warned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. The BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm28g5exx09o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">person identified as \"A\"</a> stands out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar, email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted his team for a response.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">FBI email suggests 10 possible 'co-conspirators'</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Justice An undated photo released by the US justice department shows Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell seated close together outside a wooden home, appearing to be a cabin of some kind in a wooded area\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Justice</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The name of Ghislaine Maxwell (R) is one of two names not redacted on an FBI list</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">DoJ says alleged Epstein letter to Nassar is fake</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Larry Nassar from the shoulders up, wearing square framed glasses with wire rims and orange jumpsuit, looks off to his left\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Larry Nassar</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter included in the released batch of documents has gained plenty of attention online. But, according to the DoJ, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the text reads. \"We shared one thing…our love &amp; caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The writer signs the letter off: \"Life is unfair, Yours, J Epstein.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent - apparently as a return - to the Manhattan jail in which Epstein was detained before his death in 2019. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The released documents show that the FBI was alerted to the letter and requested an analysis of it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the letter's release on Tuesday, the DoJ called the document a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" the DoJ added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York.

With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more often in recent years it was Rupert - for many decades the most influential media titan in the world - and his daughter Elisabeth who would make time for each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would certainly have room this year to host her father at the luxurious home she has renovated on the edge of the Cotswolds. But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage Rupert Murdoch (R) and daughter Elisabeth Murdoch attend the Cheltenham Festival \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'James and Rupert will never patch up differences'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable.

They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years.

They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
