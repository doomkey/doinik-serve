They have argued that the security of the Arctic region should be a joint Nato responsibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have dispatched a small number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announcing the new tariffs in a post on his Truth Social platform on Saturday, Trump said those countries were playing \"a very dangerous game\". At stake, he said, was the \"Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the proposed 10% levy to be introduced next month on goods exported to the US would rise to 25% in June and remain \"payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his response, Starmer said: \"Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of Nato allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the US administration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France's Emmanuel Macron said: \"Tariff threats are unacceptable in this context...  We will not be swayed by any intimidation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swedish PM Ulf Kristersson said: We won't let ourselves be blackmailed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sweden is currently having intensive discussions with other EU countries, Norway and the United Kingdom to find a joint response,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European Council President Antonio Costa stated: \"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law...  which of course begins within the territory of the member states of the European Union.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark's foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said the threat had \"come as a surprise\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, German MEP Manfred Weber, head of the conservative EPP group in the European Parliament, said Trump's move raised questions about the still-to-be-ratified EU-US trade deal negotiated last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brussels and Washington clinched a deal that agreed a US tariff on all EU goods of 15% and that the 27-member bloc would open its markets to US exporters with 0% tariffs on certain products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-US trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" Weber posted on X. \"The 0% tariffs on US products must be put on hold,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\"

escalated his drive to acquire Greenland</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US ambassador to the UN, Mike Waltz, however, said Denmark \"just doesn't have the resources or the capacity to do what needs to be done in the northern region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told Fox News the life of Greenlanders would be \"safer, stronger and more prosperous under the umbrella of the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has often mused that \"tariff\" is his favourite word, and he has made clear that he views it as something of a blunt instrument with which to convince – or coerce – countries around the world to align their policies with the desired outcomes of the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his announcement represents a significant escalation in his recently rekindled drive to acquire Greenland, despite their opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unclear what immediately prompted the tariffs announcement, which Trump first hinted at while speaking to reporters at the White House on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While in recent weeks he has repeatedly said that a variety of options – including the potential use of military force – remained on the table, the announcement comes just days after US and Danish officials agreed to set up a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Washington's diplomatic and political circles, that announcement was seen by many as a \"best-case\" scenario for Denmark and its European allies – one that would, at the very least, delay any decision or further escalation from the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the latest tariffs have injected a newfound sense of urgency into the issue and strained relations with important Nato allies and trading partners.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ajay Banga, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct7x6q\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">president of the World Bank</a>, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody,\" the president said last October.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79rqd947vzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer</a>, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images In an aerial view, people walk amid the destruction in Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip.

It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology &amp; Women's Health</a>, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US President Donald Trump talks into a microphone in the White House, with Robert F.

When they hit buildings and homes in the city of Odesa down below \"we see all the fires too\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her daughter Eva, who is nine, has learned the shapes and sounds of the objects that zoom through the sky on a daily basis.

Through strikes on port and energy infrastructure, Russia is trying to cripple the region's economy and dent the population's morale.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"We can see and hear when the drones come,\" says Odesa resident Mariia</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow, however, does not just hit facilities. Its drones, most of them as big as a motorcycle, regularly crash into high-rise buildings like Masha's, exploding on impact and blowing glass and debris inward. The consequences are often deadly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A few months ago Eva said she was afraid the drone would come too fast and we wouldn't have time to hide,\" Mariia says. \"But I explained that if it came towards us, it would get louder and louder and then we'd know we have to run.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariia, Serhii and Eva are originally from Kherson, a region 200km (125m) to the east of Odesa which is now in large part occupied by Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They left as soon as the invasion started in 2022 and mother and daughter briefly moved to Germany as refugees. But Serhii and Mariia could not bear the distance, so the family reunited in Ukraine and moved to Odesa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, as attacks on the region intensify, Serhii wonders whether the family should prepare to leave again. \"War is only about economics, and Odesa for the Russians is about infrastructure, so they will do their best to conquer it,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Serhii, Mariia and Eva's Odesa apartment suffers from frequent power cuts</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tucked in south-western Ukraine, Odesa was an economic powerhouse before the war. But now that Russia occupies the majority of Ukraine's coastline, the region has become even more vital. Its three ports are Ukraine's largest and include the country's only deep-water port. With land crossings disrupted, 90% of Ukraine exports last year were shipped by sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in wartime the region's importance is also its weakness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea in retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on the \"shadow fleet\" tankers Russia uses to circumvent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That threat has translated into concrete impact. For two years, Russia's attempts to thwart Odesa's economy have been near-relentless - but the last few weeks have been particularly difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aerial attacks on the ports have destroyed cargo and containers and damaged infrastructure; crew members on foreign merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Odesa have been injured or killed by drones; and 800 air-raid alerts in a year repeatedly halted port operations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A view of Odesa during a blackout\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Power outages have plunged much of Odesa into darkness since December</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The result last year was a 45% decrease in exports of agricultural products, vital to Odesa's economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day after a drone strike this week set a Panamanian-flagged ship alight and severely injured one of its crew members, regional government head Oleh Kiper said that shipowners entering Odesa ports \"clearly understand that they are entering a war zone\" and that the ships were insured. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if such attacks continue, in the long run foreign companies may be put off trading with the port.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"After a strike like last night's, the people who live here will go to shelters for some time, then they will relax again,\" says Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the strikes surge, air sirens go off frequently, but not everyone heeds them. Standing in front of a destroyed gym the morning after an overnight drone strike that injured seven people, Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service concedes people have become \"very careless about their own safety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent air raid alert lasted for most of the day. \"Sitting in a shelter for 16 hours is simply unrealistic,\" Averina says, as gym staff emerge from the destroyed building with whatever objects they have managed to salvage from the rubble and mangled metal inside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many Ukrainians are now sadly accustomed to the drone and missile strikes, they are increasingly frayed by the relentless attacks that cut off electricity and heating in the middle of a particularly biting winter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, almost a million people in Odesa were left with no power. \"We were among the first regions to experience what it means to go through the winter period without electricity and without heating,\" says Oleh Kiper.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"I live in hope that all this will end soon,\" says Yana. \"We've all been living like this for four years now, but unfortunately, for now it's how it is.\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A month later, as temperatures hover around -1C, the supply remains severely disrupted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ada, 36, is strolling on the beach, unfazed by the wail of air alert sirens mingling with the squawking of seagulls. The drone attacks have ramped up but, she says, \"the shelling isn't as scary as this cold is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearby, a young mum named Yana agrees. Recently, she says, the situation across the board \"has been really, really difficult\". At one point, a drone crashed into her flat, and another one hit the block soon afterwards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came the power cuts. She and her family bought an expensive generator, but running it for seven hours costs around $10 - a significant expense in a country where the average monthly salary is around $500 (£375).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've all been living like this for four years now, unfortunately.

The shades though are still at times in evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures show him at the opening of schools, or transport and mining infrastructure or cycling through the streets of the capital, Conakry.

They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e0jnww2e9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're more worried about food.

Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney (2nd-R) speaks during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the Great Hall of the People on January 16, 2026 in Beijing, China\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Carney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  </figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A trade reset </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A frosty history </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population,\" Hlaing told the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that \"a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people\", so the outcome was of \"fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War.

the son of the president and his potential successor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Veteran figures from the party's old guard were pushed aside, replaced by newer faces, many without the credentials of having fought in the war that brought Museveni to power 40 years ago, but widely seen as loyal to his son. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to sources close to the presidency, authority at State House has become increasingly decentralised, with decisions once taken directly by Museveni now channelled through a tight inner circle of relatives and long-time associates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's day-to-day schedule is said to be overseen by his eldest daughter, Natasha Karugire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relations with foreign dignitaries and senior military figures are largely managed by his half-brother, Salim Saleh, while trade and economic policy are shaped by his son-in-law, Odrek Rwabwogo, married to Museveni's second daughter, Patience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And for the first time in the country's modern history, all security matters - both internal and external - are overseen by the chief of defence forces, the 51-year-old Gen Kainerugaba. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the dominant role that the military has long played in Ugandan politics and the fact that Museveni himself came to power through armed struggle, this concentration of authority in his hands has profound political implications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It suggests that Uganda's future is being shaped -

In fact, it's so outlandish that they may indeed be more baffled than angry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nobody in the world would assume that a threat like this - based on acquiring the land of your ally - would ever actually happen. Does Trump really have the backing in the US, in Congress, even in his own administration to do this?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Is this, as some trade officials have to assume, the biggest TACO (Trump will Chicken Out) of all time? These things can come and go and, economically, these countries have handled the damage so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Greenland: 'Diplomatic channels are the way to go', US speaker tells BBC</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Think of Canada.

How would the world react if China or Russia had sent a threat like this to some of their allies?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The basis of the threat is clearly deeply worrying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in capitals around the world will read Trump's social media announcement and question the functioning of American decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump arrives to meet leaders of the allied countries whose economies he has just threatened at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the world will hope that, by that time, this unparalleled threat will have somehow disappeared.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A self-conscious sandwich generation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Popularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities.

In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,\" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy59pvkqvl5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Carney told reporters on Friday</a> that \"the world has changed\" in recent years, and the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's relationship with China, he added, had become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later wrote, in a social media post, that Canada was \"recalibrating\" its relationship with China, \"strategically, pragmatically, and decisively\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as \"very good news\". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China \"would hurt our economy and lead to job losses\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was \"inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China,\" Astvansh added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal \"problematic\" and said Canada may come to regret it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as \"a good thing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" he told reporters outside the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it \"irrelevant\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,\" he said. \"And Canada needs to be prepared.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/20d8/live/7af6c940-f312-11f0-9c83-cf045898c668.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Aerial view showing hundreds of new energy vehicles waiting to be loaded onto a ro-ro ship for export at Taicang Port on January 15, 2025 in Taicang, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province of China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for over 70% of global production</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas \"until at least the end of the year\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said \"the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said it was the result of an \"unfortunate\" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US has really put Canada in a corner,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces \"some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world\". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that,\" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. \"Let China come in, let Japan come in.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a \"recalibration\" of Canada's trade relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-daniel-bush-in-washington\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">With additional reporting from Daniel Bush in Washington</b></i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It became a national scandal, Finland's biggest-ever crime, and the then Prime Minister Sanna Marin convened an emergency meeting of ministers to discuss a response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was already too late to stop the hacker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before sending the emails to Vastaamo's patients, the hacker had published the entire database of records stolen from the company on the dark web and an unknown number of people had read or downloaded a copy.

Barbie memorabilia fills her shelves and there's a pole-dancing pole in the centre of her living room. But don't be fooled by how things seem on the surface, Auer says. She has struggled with depression and anxiety for most of her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm outgoing and very confident and I love being around people,\" Auer says, \"but I get that inkling that they all think I'm stupid and ugly, and that my life is a continuum of mistakes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer first sought help in 2015. She told her Vastaamo therapist about her mental health problems, her drinking and a relationship she'd had aged 18 with an older man she'd kept secret from her family. She says she trusted her therapist completely and with his help she made real progress. She had no idea what he had written in his notes of their conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time she received the ransom email, news had already broken about the Vastaamo hack. Three days earlier, the extortionist had begun to drip-feed therapy notes on the dark web in batches of 100 a day, in the hope of putting pressure on the company to pay the much larger ransom - the bitcoin equivalent of around £400,000 - that he had been demanding from them for weeks.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Auer says she felt compelled to look through them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I had never used the dark web before.

A former paralegal at the Social Security Administration, she was left without a stable income when the US government shut down a few months ago. She lost her job permanently after Christmas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper first missed her credit card payments in October, when her paycheques ground to a halt.

They averaged about 22% as of November, up from 13% a decade ago, Federal Reserve data shows. 37% of adults carry a credit card balance, and overall credit card debt in the US totals more than $1tn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It does show that consumers are feeling pinched, they're going to continue to feel pinched,\" Susan Schmidt, portfolio manager at Exchange Capital Resources in Chicago, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the Trump administration is trying to find a way out of it.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's proposal, which was among his campaign promises, was met with a swift backlash from bank executives, who say a cap would erode consumers' access to credit. Banks could cut credit limits or close riskier accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interest charges are a source of revenue for banks and other big lenders, amounting to $160bn in 2024, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - an agency that Trump largely dismantled last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Banks are already pushing to protect that income, arguing that a rate cap would backfire to the detriment of consumers. JP Morgan hinted at the possibility of legal action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People will lose access to credit on a very, very extensive and broad basis, especially the people who need it the most,\" Jeremy Barnum, JP Morgan's chief financial officer, warned on the company's earnings call on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jane Fraser, Citigroup's chief executive, also pushed back against the proposal on Wednesday and warned of a \"severe impact on access to credit and on consumer spending across the country\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts and economists agree that a cap, on its own, might not benefit consumers as much as Trump and lawmakers across the political aisle claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A 10% cap may not be the right solution because the people that are already in trouble, that's not necessarily going to help them,\" said Schmidt of Exchange Capital Resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Benedict Guttman-Kenney, an assistant professor of finance at Rice University, said banks might respond by limiting how much they lend to people with lower credit scores, who are considered higher-risk borrowers. Those are the people most at risk of losing access to credit cards, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Banks, he added, might also try to recoup their revenue elsewhere, like by raising annual fees or late fees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not clear that people are going to be better off,\" Guttman-Kenney said. \"They're still paying similar amounts of money.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he noted that some bank expenses are \"bloated\", meaning they have room to cut costs to keep their margins intact. They could, for example, trim down how much they spend on marketing, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a recent Vanderbilt University study found that Americans would save roughly $100bn a year in interest costs if a 10% rate cap were to be implemented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is something people would see, they would notice, they would feel it,\" said Brian Shearer, a researcher at Vanderbilt's Policy Accelerator and the author of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This alone would impact their household budgets substantially.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shearer questioned a key argument put forward by bank executives and their lobbyists: that any reduction in rates will necessarily lead to a reduction in lending. He pointed to banks' robust margins in the credit card market. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interest payments, he added, do not account for the majority of the revenue that banks earn on credit cards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No policy is without some pros and cons,\" Shearer said. \"To continue lending, banks would have to reduce rewards to some extent, especially to people with lower FICO scores (credit scores).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"However, the savings from interest, even to those people who lose some rewards, would far exceed the lost rewards.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'I'm losing sleep'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Morgan, 31, who asked to use only her first name, is also among those struggling to pay down thousands of dollars. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since last May, she has been using her Discover card to pay for her two-year-old daughter's childcare, while unemployed. She said she decided to send her daughter to daycare because she needed the freedom, due to struggles with her mental and physical health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those payments have left her with $6,700 in credit card debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Morgan's husband works in the military and pays for the family's other expenses. Through a service member benefit programme, she secured an interest rate of roughly 3% on her credit card.

Her team swarms the vehicle immediately, their blue-gloved fists knocking all over the chassis to check for false compartments. Others question the driver, rifle through his belongings and scour his mobile phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are searching for vapes - which the Singapore government has spent months waging war against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vapes or e-cigarettes have been banned in the city-state since 2018. But in recent years drug-laced vapes, known by their street name K-pods, have become popular on the black market - unnerving a country known for its zero tolerance of drugs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz60z98nzx7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">launched a harsh crackdown</a>, putting in place tough punishments with more targeted laws on the way. Now, if you get caught with an e-cigarette in Singapore, you could be jailed, sent to state rehab, or even caned. A massive public health campaign has blanketed the island, warning Singaporeans of the dangers of vaping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It comes as many countries consider tighter regulation. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12477511/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A World Health Organization (WHO) bulletin</a> has called Singapore's campaign a \"turning point\" that will \"influence the next decade of global tobacco and drug policy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could others follow suit?</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Okay, you can go.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at Woodlands Checkpoint, Liaw and her team of customs officers wave off the driver they were searching - he was clean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most vapes come to Singapore from Malaysia.

Singaporean vapers have told the BBC that even after 2018 they could easily purchase vape supplies via forums and chat apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, in recent years, a new product emerged on the black market –  K-pods. These are vapes laced with etomidate, a type of anaesthetic which has the same mind-numbing effect as ketamine, hence the nickname.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, videos of young people passing out in public or acting erratically on public transport – all after puffing on K-pods - went viral. Last July, a random test of 100 seized vapes found about one third contained etomidate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news shocked Singapore. Many asked how this was possible in a country that prides itself for keeping out most drugs through severe punishments, even for marijuana use, and a mandatory death penalty for traffickers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities quickly swung into action. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong declared that vaping was now a drug issue and his government would crack down not only on K-pods but all vapes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The vapes themselves are just delivery devices. The real danger is what's inside,\" warned Mr Wong last August. \"Right now, it's etomidate. In future, it could be something worse, stronger, far more dangerous drugs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September the government rolled out new penalties for vapers including state-mandated rehabilitation and fines of up to 10,000 Singapore dollars (£5,765; $7,780). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The punishments are more severe for sellers, particularly those caught with drug-laced vapes. They could be jailed for up to 20 years and receive up to 15 strokes of the cane - a painful punishment where convicts are flogged on their buttocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreigners face the same punishments and can also be deported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Strict rules have been introduced in schools where students caught with vapes could face suspensions, expulsion, and also caning. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More penalties are expected in the next few months, as the government comes up with legislation targeting etomidate and other drugs that could be found in vapes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Vape bins\" have been placed across the island for users to dispose of their devices without penalty.

They point to a declining percentage of drug-laced vapes which now make up less than a tenth of seized e-cigarettes, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moh.gov.sg/newsroom/more-than-1-900-persons-caught-for-e-vaporiser-offences-in-first-nine-weeks-since-enhanced-penalties/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">according to police figures.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not many in Singapore appear to publicly oppose this crackdown – the majority of Singaporeans have long supported the government's tough drug policies. But online and in private, there are some who complain that the new restrictions go too far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One vaper, who asked to be identified with the pseudonym Michael, said it \"wasn't right\" that the government was \"strong-arming\" him into giving up vaping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Cigarettes are known to be bad for you, right? Yet they're legal. Vaping is a big question. So do you want something that you know is going to harm you, or will you take a chance?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's a personal choice, I think, and to just blanket-ban [vapes], I think it's sloppy, it's lazy… let the people choose for themselves,\" said Michael, who says he uses regular vapes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another vaper, who wanted to be known by the pseudonym Toby, said he could understand the need for a harsh crackdown, particularly to protect teens from gaining access to drugs via vapes. \"It's not the most popular move, but it certainly is the most efficient… it's cutting the head off a snake,\" he admitted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he pointed out that before the crackdown, most e-cigarette users in Singapore were, like him, using regular vapes and not K-pods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He felt the ban was not fair because \"one bad apple spoils the whole batch. I feel that for a lot of the adults who don't take drugs, they have to suffer [this ban]… and they would have to go back to smoking,\" said Toby, who plans to switch back to smoking cigarettes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Singaporeans have also questioned if the proliferation of drug-laced vapes was in part caused by the government's 2018 ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jom.media/singapore-this-week-220825/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">An editorial in independent magazine Jom</a> pointed out that the ban created \"incentives for black marketers to create the most high-value, addictive products\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, in turn, led to the rising popularity of K-pods and the need for a harsher crackdown, which the Jom editorial deemed \"the Great Panic of 2025\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, a Singapore health ministry spokesperson told the BBC that the government banned vaping before it becomes as \"entrenched\" as cigarette smoking, to \"pre-emptively stop new harmful and addictive products from entering the market and prevent a new set of associated health issues\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The fact that a black market can sell illicit substances to a small minority cannot possibly be the justification to make abuse of the substance a legitimate mainstream habit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dean of the Saw Swee Hock School Of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, Teo Yik Ying, has argued that Singapore did the right thing as \"an outright ban has contained the problem\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In contrast, countries that legalised vapes saw demand explode and youth uptake surge while illicit actors thrive anyway. In other words, regulation in lieu of a ban does not prevent illicit trade – it amplifies it by creating a vast consumer base to serve,\" he wrote in a commentary published last year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singapore's stance stands in contrast to some countries, like the UK, which see vaping as a less dangerous alternative to cigarettes and thus useful for helping people quit smoking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/quit-smoking/ready-to-quit-smoking/vaping-to-quit-smoking/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The National Health Service (NHS)</a> notes that while vaping is \"not completely harmless\" and that non-smokers and youths should not take it up, it is \"less harmful than smoking\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NHS also states that vaping is \"one of the most effective tools\" for smoking cessation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Peter Hajek, a clinical psychologist and director of the health and lifestyle research unit at the Queen Mary University of London, argues that banning vaping is \"detrimental to public health\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It stops smokers who find giving up nicotine difficult from using a method that would help them avoid smoking related cancers, heart disease and lung disease; and it protects the cigarette trade from its much less risky competitor,\" said Prof Hajek, who has received research funding from manufacturers of stop-smoking medications but has no links with any tobacco or e-cigarettes manufacturers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Banning all vapes because some e-cigarettes could contain drugs was akin to \"banning suitcases because some people can carry drugs in them,\" said Prof Hajek. \"Just ban drug vapes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is also growing concern about the health implications of e-cigarette use, as the number of vapers worldwide swells to an estimated 100 million.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, a rise of vaping among students <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pj2ez7evo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">has led schools to ask the government for help</a> in tackling what has been described as a \"public health emergency\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Research in recent years indicates that vaping could potentially harm users' health by impairing blood vessels and causing lung injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/tobacco-e-cigarettes\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The WHO's current advice</a> states that vaping has \"not been proven effective\" at the population level in helping smokers quit cigarettes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the WHO and US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) insist that e-cigarettes are not completely safe and more research needs to be done on vaping's long-term effects on health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singapore's government has made up its mind. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.sg/stopvaping-support-vapers/#feea3eb42c41db4d7fd9fa92bbdd5fd6\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">It argues that</a> vape pods could contain much higher doses of nicotine than cigarettes, making vaping \"more addictive\" and thus tougher to quit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singapore also argues that vapes are not safe because they contain \"cancer-causing\" chemicals, toxins and heavy metals. Some organisations like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/smoking-and-cancer/is-vaping-harmful\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Cancer Research UK</a> point out that the levels of these chemicals are low and that \"there is no good evidence that vaping causes cancer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the level of its crackdown is rarely seen elsewhere, Singapore is far from the only country that has restricted vaping. At least 46 countries now ban the sale of vapes, while another 82 have some form of regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK's Tobacco and Vapes Bill, which would ban the sale of vapes to under-18s and restrict vape advertising, is making its way through parliament. Australia has made e-cigarettes available only through doctors' prescriptions to quit smoking, while Belgium has banned disposable vapes with plans for further restrictions. Malaysia is targeting to ban all vapes this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of these efforts are aimed at limiting vape access for youths, a key target market for e-cigarette companies. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/06-10-2025-who-tobacco-trends-report-1-in-5-adults-still-addicted-to-tobacco\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">The WHO estimates</a> there are at least 15 million children – aged 13 to 15 years old – who use e-cigarettes, and that children are nine times more likely than adults to vape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we're not careful, we're going to get a [vaping] epidemic that starts with the younger generations that would just get worse over time,\" said Yvette van der Eijk, who researches tobacco policies with the National University of Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She pointed out that cigarette smoking was \"an example of how things can turn out if you don't nip these kind of issues in the bud\", and warned the world was at risk of \"repeating history\" if it does not curb vaping soon. A ban like Singapore's, she said, was \"more prudent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But few places in the world are like Singapore, whose tiny size and powerful government have enabled it to effectively enforce a strict ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the question of how long any country, let alone Singapore, could sustain a prolonged and exacting war against vapes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months following the crackdown, vapers in Singapore say it is still possible to get their supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And when it gets too difficult, they can simply cross the border into Indonesian and Malaysian towns, which have reportedly seen thriving demand for vapes from travelling Singaporeans. One Indonesian tourism official has touted the nearby island of Batam as an \"alternative [place] to enjoy vapes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toby, the vaper who is switching to cigarettes, pointed out that Singapore's crackdown treats vaping as a vice, and \"any vice is like a cockroach\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can try to kill it, try to enforce against it - but you can never fully get rid of it.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Within two days Spotify recommended Sienna Rose, who has a similar, but more generic sound.

And having listened to the music, is there just some of the soul in the soul missing?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be fair, many others have fallen for Rose's songs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among them is pop star Selena Gomez, who used the Rose track Where Your Warmth Begins as the background for an Instagram post about Sunday's Golden Globes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The song was later removed when questions about Rose's identity spread online, but Gomez's post took interest in Rose and her identity to a new level.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And many of the listeners who'd been playing Rose's music reacted with dismay when they learned she might not exist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Please tell me she's real,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.threads.com/search?q=%22sienna%20rose%22&amp;serp_type=default\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">pined one on Threads</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm disappointed cuz a couple of her songs came on and the music isn't BAD,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/getthefortune.bsky.social/post/3mcfzramvr22q\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">agreed another on Bluesky</a>. \"[But] somebody said once you know then it sounds soulless' and I agree.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">AI music ban</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of course, it's entirely possible that everyone has got it wrong, and Sienna Rose is a real singer who shuns the limelight. Maybe she's in witness protection. Perhaps she's a real singer, stuck in a contractual dispute with her label, and releasing music under a pseudonym.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If so, I'm sorry. It must be crushing to have your music labelled as soulless \"slop\". But that's indicative of the problem facing the entire music industry right now. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI software is becoming so sophisticated that clone artists are competing with genuine musicians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Sweden this week, a chart-topping song was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp829jey9z7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">banned from the charts</a> after journalists discovered the artist behind it, Jacub, didn't exist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are many people - both in tech companies and the business side of the music industry - who want to see AI succeed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The costs of launching an act like Sienna Rose are practically zero, but her music is making an estimated £2,000 in royalties per week. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compare that to the K-Pop industry, where labels invest an average of $1m (£750,000) per member of a girl or boy group per year, and you can see the attraction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interestingly, several of Rose's songs appear to be credited to US indie record label Broke - who have a track record in turning viral artists like bbno$ and Ndotz into chart stars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you visit their website, Rose isn't listed as one of their signings - but British dance act Haven are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If that name rings a bell, it's because they got into trouble late last year for creating a song using an AI clone of Jorja Smith's voice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their song, Run, was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyvjye18e9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">removed from streaming services</a> after record industry bodies issued takedown notices, alleging the track violated copyright - but was re-recorded with human vocals, and entered the UK Top 10 two weeks ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Broke to ask about their relationship with Sienna Rose, but has yet to receive a reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has also contacted another label, Nostalgic Records, which lists Rose on its website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nostalgic Records' biography claims she is \"London-based\" and says she is \"not just a performer, but a storyteller of the heart\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b062/live/37bc2eb0-f2d9-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Raye sings on stage wearing a red dress with a microphone in her hand, with the lead over her shoulder \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The pop star Raye says fans prefer genuine, heartfelt music over computer-generated emptiness</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Deezer says 34% of the songs uploaded to its streaming service  -
