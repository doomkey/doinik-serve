A lot of Ukrainians have died,\" the US president said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia has consistently insisted on Ukraine recognising Russian sovereignty over several Ukrainian regions, agreeing to demilitarisation and abandoning its Nato aspirations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's position has also consistently involved Ukraine sacrificing land for peace.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Zelensky has been careful not to criticise Trump, his post on social media makes clear that he will not accept it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a Telegram post on Saturday, he said \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier\", and reiterated that Ukraine must be involved in any solution for peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are ready, together with President Trump, together with all partners, to work for a real, and most importantly, lasting peace - a peace that will not collapse because of Moscow's wishes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This is what Ukraine, and many European allies, were always worried about - Trump and Putin trying to do a deal without Ukraine present.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a post on X on Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Ukraine's future could not \"be decided without the Ukrainians\" and warned that \"Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as their own security is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's words on Russia may have hardened in recent months, but for Ukraine they have yet to be followed by tangible actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Friday, a deadline set by the US president for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face more sanctions passed without any apparent consequences. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC's US partner CBS News, citing a senior White House official, reported that it remains possible Zelensky could end up being involved in the meeting between Putin and Trump in some way, as planning for the Friday meeting is still fluid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the ground there is a resignation that any initial peace talks may not include Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soldiers and civilians the BBC spoke to expressed a strong desire for peace. There is exhaustion from the constant fighting and Russian drone and missile attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is little evidence that Ukraine is willing to accept a peace at any price - much less one that will be forced on it without its voice being heard.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its pre-war population was estimated at around 600,000 people, but that number has grown significantly throughout the war as Israel's military campaign has pushed Palestinians into the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many living there now have already been displaced multiple times through the war and are living in tents or the ruins of buildings that have been partially destroyed by Israeli air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli media reports that the military would move the population towards al-Mawasi, a vast tent encampment in the south of Gaza, already home to thousands of Palestinians suffering from an absence of basic facilities and sanitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plan is being widely condemned by humanitarian agencies and indeed many of Israel's allies for its potential to add untold human suffering onto the shoulders of an already exhausted and beleaguered people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The move to take control of Gaza City will further complicate Palestinians' ability to meet their basic needs for survival, as UN-backed global food security experts say the \"worst-case scenario of famine\" is already playing out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian agency said on Friday that the amount of aid entering Gaza continues to be \"far below the minimum required to meet people's immense needs\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has denied there is starvation in Gaza and accused UN agencies of not picking up aid at the borders and delivering it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian agency said it continues to see impediments and delays as it tries to collect aid from Israeli-controlled border zones.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Challenges in distributing aid persist as deaths of people trying to get food continue to be reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gaza's health ministry said on Saturday that 21 people had been killed trying to get aid in the last 24 hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians have been killed seeking food since late May, when a new US and Israeli-backed organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) set up aid distribution sites. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN said most were killed by the Israeli military, with 859 killed near GHF sites and 514 along the routes of food convoys. The GHF denies the UN's figure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of instigating chaos near the aid centres and says its forces do not intentionally open fire on civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel does not allow the BBC and other news organisations to report independently from Gaza, making it difficult to verify.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its announcement of the plan to conquer Gaza City, Israel's prime minister's office said it will provide \"humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones\", but did not provide further information of what that might entail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Like previous forced displacements throughout the war, the expulsion of Palestinians will likely see chaotic and dangerous scenes of families travelling by foot, by cart or by overloaded vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has been reported that after the deadline of 7 October 2025, Israel's military will lay siege to Gaza City and escalate its attacks. Hamas has pledged to fiercely resist Israel's attempt to conquer the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We may also see similar scenes to what the military has done in Rafah, in Gaza's south, and in northern towns, which were forcibly evacuated before being almost totally levelled in a systematic method.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If there are Hamas fighters holding Israeli hostages in Gaza City, then this period would prove the most deadly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is understood that Hamas has given orders to captors to kill hostages should Israeli military troops approach close to hiding locations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An estimated 20 Israeli hostages remain alive in Gaza, some of whom are believed to be held around Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel began its military offensive in Gaza after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on October 7 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, more than 61,300 people have been killed in Gaza as a result of Israeli military operations.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In the past, Aliyev has demanded that Armenia give his country a railroad corridor to Nakhichevan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Armenia wanted to have control of the road and the Azerbaijani leader has in the past threatened to take the corridor by force. The issue has halted and stalled previous peace negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both leaders praised Trump and his team throughout the meeting: \"President Trump, in six months, did a miracle,\" Aliyev said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump said he had also signed a bilateral agreement with both countries to expand  energy and technology trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US president has sought to make peace deals between several warring countries during his second term.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The summit on Friday also signifies the US expanding its influence in the region at the expense of Russia. For more than a century, the Kremlin has played the role of power and peace broker there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has acted as the main mediator in the conflict. The last agreement signed by Aliyev and Pashinyan was crafted by Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump now bringing the two countries together, Putin is largely sidelined. Moscow has worked to insert its interests into peace talks, but both sides abandoned those proposals in favour of an American solution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The announcement on Friday came shortly before Trump announced that he would meet Putin for talks in Alaska next week.</p></div></div></body></html>"

But years of migration to cities have shrunk families and turned places like Seoul into sprawling metropolises. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unaffordable housing, rising costs and gruelling working hours have led more and more young people to reject marriage or parenthood, or both.

The choice of name - \"convenience stores\" - was a deliberate attempt to distance them from psychiatric clinics, important in a country where there is still a stigma against asking for help for mental health - especially among older residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, some of their reservations can still be seen when they walk through the door for the first time, compounded by their experience of isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Visitors are often uncomfortable speaking to another person or eating together initially, store manager Lee says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The typical loneliness, if that repeats for days, months, and half year, that is now more than a feeling,\" Lee explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Those folks start to avoid places with people. So many people ask us if they can take the ramen to go because they won't eat with others.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lee would tell them that they don't need to talk.

The only bowler to take 10 wickets in a match was Akash Deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Failures were scant, heroes were plenty, but the pillars of India's extraordinary show in the series were Gill and Siraj.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gill, in Bradmanesque form, made 754 runs, 430 of them coming in one Test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He failed by a mere 20 runs to break Sunil Gavaskar's record series aggregate, and was also second to Don Bradman (810) for highest runs made in a series by a captain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To be mentioned alongside Bradman and Gavaskar testifies to Gill's achievement and potential. His prolific scoring earned his team's full respect, and after a hesitant start, he quickly grew in confidence, showing fine temperament and smart tactics in tough situations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images India's Akash Deep (L) and India's Yashasvi Jaiswal 2L) celebrate winning the final Test cricket match between England and India at The Oval in London on August 4, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The future looks rosy for the young Indian team</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj, who since his 2021 debut had lived in the shadows of Bumrah and Shami, emerged so spectacularly that he instantly entered cricket folklore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feisty and indefatigable, he bowled with a lion's heart - steaming in at full tilt, sparing his body no mercy, embracing the spearhead's role in Bumrah's absence, and inspiring the other pacers to bowl out of their skins - earning universal awe and admiration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj's 23 wickets came at an average of 32.43, with an economy rate of 4.02 and a strike rate of 48.43 - hardly earth-shattering figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In India's two victories, he was the decisive force.

Trump previously had been more than willing to outline his views on Gaza's future - even when it caught Netanyahu and the Israelis by surprise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Americans also expressed their unhappiness with Israeli attacks on Syria last month - publicly disapproving, while offering even sharper criticism in private.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bibi acted like a madman,\" a White House official told the news website Axios. \"He bombs everything all the time.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As recently as a month ago, the White House was optimistic that a deal was within reach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire,\" Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a \"lasting peace in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But just over two weeks later, ceasefire talks had collapsed, and Witkoff was publicly accusing Hamas of being selfish and not acting in good faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hamas didn't really want to make a deal,\" Trump said on 25 July. \"I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, that will become apparent soon enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Trump administration has got a lot of leverage, \" said Prof Saikal of the Australian National University. \"I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on,\" Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. These moves were designed to bring additional pressure on Israel to wind down its military operations and reach a negotiated settlement with Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both represent a tacit acknowledgement that the current situation is untenable, and that a negotiated peace is further away than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, there is no telling how long this trend will last. But by the time Trump changes course again, Israel could be well down a path in Gaza that will be very difficult to reverse.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Paul Biya</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 92, Paul Biya is the world's oldest serving head of state. He has been in power for nearly 43 years since 1982. Biya leads the ruling CPDM party which dominates the political scene. He is widely considered the favourite, now that his main rival, Kamto, is out of the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The veteran politician has never lost an election since the return of multi-party politics in 1990. However, his victories have been marred by allegations of vote rigging – claims which his party and the government have continuously denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing his intention to run, Biya said his eighth mandate would focus on the wellbeing of women and young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"2.-bello-bouba-maigari\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">2. Bello Bouba Maigari</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bello Bouba Maigari, 78, is an experienced politician who hails from Cameroon's vote-rich northern region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the president of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) party founded in 1990. He served in the governments of both of Cameroon's presidents -Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In fact, he was Biya's first prime minister between 1982 and 1983. Since 1997, Maigari has forged an alliance with Biya's CPDM party that helped the latter clinch significant votes from the north. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, this political marriage ended in June following pressure from within his party to run independently. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While serving as Minister of State for Tourism and Leisure, Maigari announced his resignation and declared himself a candidate against Biya, who he also faced in the 1992 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"3.-issa-tchiroma-bakary\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">3. Issa Tchiroma Bakary</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another former Biya ally whose candidacy came as a surprise is 75-year-old Issa Tchiroma Bakary. Like Maigari, he is from the country's north and has been influential in helping Biya secure the region's votes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After a 20-year stint in different government roles, Tchiroma finally pulled the plug on his time with the 92-year-old leader, resigning from his role as Minister of Employment and Vocational Training to announce his candidacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tchiroma, who heads the Cameroon National Salvation Front (CNSF) party, criticised Biya's governance style and hinged his presidential bid on a promise to overhaul the system, which he described as \"suffocating\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A man painted in green and white colours \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Supporters of Joshua Osih came out in donned in party colours when he campaigned in the 2018 election, but he came fourth</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"4.-cabral-libii\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">4.

This time around, Muna, a staunch international anti-corruption lawyer, says he wants to challenge Biya himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 72-year-old is from a family of politicians - his late father Solomon Tandeng Muna served as Prime Minister of West Cameroon after independence, Vice-President of the then Federal Republic of Cameroon and Speaker of the National Assembly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Speaker, Solomon Muna swore in Biya when he took over as president after Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Muna is promising to rid the bilingual country of the corruption and bad governance that he says have soiled its image at the international scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"6.-joshua-osih\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">6.

Since becoming a member of parliament in the process, he has challenged the government on key policy issues, promising sweeping changes if he takes over the reins of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Dr Hugues says Libii's vision is opaque, citing Akere Muna as a more convincing candidate with a much clearer project for the nation of nearly 30 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Muna has a wealth of international experience and diplomatic character, and that is what the nation needs now,\" he said, while praising the renowned lawyer's five-year transition plan to \"put the nation back on track\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Could the opposition unite?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Historically, Cameroon's opposition has been fragmented especially during elections, with analysts saying this has disadvantaged them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of this year's presidential election, there has been much talk about the need for the opposition to unite and harmonise strategies to take on Biya. But with each candidate prioritising their own interests, it remains unclear if most – let alone all – of them would work together, despite the risk this could help the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It might be the end of their political careers, or their parties, if they don't come together,\" said civil society leader Felix Agbor Balla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Kamto and the others must look for someone in the opposition who can carry the baton – and they must put the nation first, rise above their personal ego to look for a consensual candidate that can give the CPDM a run on the 12th of October,\" he told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu via Getty Images Protesters gather at Place de la Republique in Paris on May 31, 2025, at the call of the Cameroonian diaspora.

Fru Ndi even claimed victory, but the authorities rejected allegations of vote rigging and confirmed Biya as the winner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many believe if the opposition doesn't band together as it did in 1992, Biya might have an easy ride to the presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He has the experience, the human resources and the system to his advantage,\" says Dr Hugues.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">More about Cameroon from the BBC:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

The treated water was by definition safe to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem was that under EU law, \"natural mineral water\" – which sells at a huge premium over tap water – is supposed to be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle. That is the whole point of it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If brands like Evian, Vichy and Perrier have been so successful in France and around the world, it is thanks to an appealing image of mountain-sides, rushing streams, purity and health-giving minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Admit filtering the water, and the industry risks breaking the market spell.  Consumers might begin to ask what they'd been paying for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Complicating matters for Perrier and its parent company Nestlé – as well as President Emmanuel Macron's government – is the charge that executives and ministers conspired to keep the affair quiet, covered up reports of contamination, and re-wrote the rules so that Perrier could continue using micro-filtration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their investigations, Le Monde and Radio France alleged that the government considered the mineral water industry so strategic that it agreed to suppress damaging information. A senate inquiry into the affair accused the government of a \"deliberate strategy\" of \"dissimulation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to the allegations, the government has asked the European Commission to rule on what level of micro-filtration is permissible for \"natural mineral water\". Aurelien Rousseau, who was head of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne's cabinet at the time, admitted there had been an \"error of appreciation\" but insisted there was never any risk to public health.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images French Senator Alexandre Ouizille (C), flanked by French Senators Laurent Burgoa (L) and Antoinette Guhl (R), presents the Senate commission of enquiry report about French industrial mineral waters during a press conference at the French Senate, Upper house of the French Parliament, in Paris on May 19, 2025\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A senate report concluded that France's government covered up the water scandal \"at the highest level\" </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, at the senate hearing into the industry, Nestlé's CEO Laurent Freixe admitted that Perrier had indeed used illicit methods to treat its water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also had another admission: that an official hydrologists' report into the company's historic site in the Gard department in southern France had recommended against renewing \"natural mineral water\" status for the company's output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It raises the possibility that for the first time in its 160-year history, Perrier water may soon not be labelled as what people assume it to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the hydrologist Emma Haziza, \"the link to climate change and global warming is absolutely established\". And if Perrier is feeling the impact ahead of other companies, it is probably because its geographical location sets it apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Far from the remote mountain landscape you might imagine, Perrier's water is pumped from deep aquifers in the coastal plain between Nîmes and Montpellier, a short drive from the Mediterranean. The area is populous, heavily-farmed, and very hot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There has been a big climatic shift since 2017,\" says Haziza. \"For five years there was a succession of droughts, which were particularly badly felt in the south.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Emma Haziza says climate change is causing a lot of problems in the south of France</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All the aquifers were affected. This means not just the upper water-table, which is where everyday tap water comes from. We can now see that the deeper aquifers – which the companies thought were protected – are also being hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The unforeseen is taking place. We are moving from a period in which companies could draw water from the deep aquifers and be sure they would be replenished, to a period in which it's obvious the whole system cannot go on.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The analysis made by Haziza and other hydrologists is that there is now a clear link between deeper and surface aquifers. Contaminants (farm chemicals or human waste) that drain off the land in the increasingly frequent flash floods, can now make their way into the lower aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, the effects of long-term drought and over-pumping mean these lower aquifers contain less volume, so any contamination will be more concentrated, the experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can foresee that what has happened first at Perrier's site will happen to other producers in the years to come. That's why we need to move away from our current model of consumption,\" says Haziza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong insists their water is \"100%\" pure</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year at the Perrier site, three million bottles had to be destroyed because of a contamination. But the company insists that any problems are swiftly detected; and it disputes the claim that contaminants are entering the deep aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are pumping water from 130 metres underground, beneath layers of limestone,\" says Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong. \"We are 100% convinced of the purity of the water. And its mineral make-up is constant.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says there is no EU ruling that specifically bans micro-filtration. The relevant text simply says that nothing must be done to disinfect or alter the mineral make-up of the water. The argument is over at what measure of micro-filtration alteration begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The original Perrier source was first tapped by a local doctor in the 1860s, but it was under British management that the brand took off 50 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">St John Harmsworth – brother of newspaper magnates Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere – made Perrier a byword for mineral water across the British empire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to company lore, Harmsworth took inspiration for the bottles' bulbous shape from the Indian clubs he used for exercise following a crippling car accident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today the bottling plant at Vergèze is still next to Harmsworth's residence and the original source. The plant has been heavily automated. A rail track connects with the SNCF network to bring hundreds of millions of cans and bottles every year to Marseille for export.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier's bottling plant is still next to the water's original source at Vergèze</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The focus for the last year has been on a new brand: Maison Perrier. These energy and flavoured drinks are proving highly successful in France and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The advantage for Perrier is that the new beverages do not claim to be \"natural mineral water\". They can be treated and filtered without difficulty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says the new brand is part of the mix, and that it has no intention of abandoning its original Source Perrier natural mineral water. It has stopped the ultra-fine (0.2 micron) microfiltration, and now uses a 0.45 micron system which has been agreed with government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has applied for \"natural mineral water\" status for just two out of the five drilling wells it was using for Perrier mineral water.
