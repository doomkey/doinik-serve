to make sure the US president has the words of Europe and of Ukraine ringing in his ears when he sits down with Putin on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1955950892470960274\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Following his departure, Zelensky posted</a> on social media thanking Sir Keir for his support in a \"good, productive meeting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We also discussed in considerable detail the security guarantees that can make peace truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky added the two discussed weapons partnerships, including investment in drone production, and the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgem31jekvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">One Hundred Year Partnership</a> Agreement with the UK, which he said is set to be ratified this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement Downing Street said the two men had \"looked ahead to tomorrow's talks between President Trump and President Putin in Alaska, which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Russia, Putin told officials he welcomes Donald Trump's \"energetic and sincere\" efforts to end the Ukraine war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that the US was seeking to \"stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all the sides involved in the conflict to create long-term conditions for peace between our countries, in Europe and in the world in general, if we at the subsequent stages arrive at agreements in the area of strategic offensive arms control\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Kremlin has announced that Putin and Trump will hold a joint press conference after their meeting on Friday evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Trump, speaking to Fox News on Thursday afternoon, said there would only be a joint press conference if the meeting was a success -- adding there's a \"25% chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting\", and suggesting sanctions on Russia could follow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump said a successful meeting would set up a second meeting, potentially with Zelensky, and repeated the idea there'll have to be a \"give and take\" of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1dxed639n7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">boundaries </a>between Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukraine has insisted that ceding territory would be unacceptable, while Russia wants to maintain control of land it has seized, including Crimea, and also wants assurances that Ukraine will not join the Nato military alliance.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Addressing a virtual meeting of the European leaders following the call with Trump, Sir Keir said a lasting ceasefire needed security guarantees, adding the coalition had \"credible\" military plans ready that could be used in the event of a ceasefire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the leaders of the group were also ready to increase economic pressure on Russia if necessary, for example through increasing sanctions, and credited Trump's efforts for progress on the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sir Alex Younger, the head of MI6 between 2014 and 2020, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's true that Donald Trump is the only one who can solve this,\" but he warned \"Putin is playing him\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're all talking about the wrong thing,\" he said, adding that the US strategy of resetting bilateral relations with Russia was \"a total fantasy\" that failed to recognise Putin's aim of the \"total subjugation\" of Ukraine.</p></div></div></body></html>"

International aid organisations have condemned the \"calculated use of starvation as a weapon of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The hunger crisis is compounded by a surge of cholera sweeping through the squalid camps of those displaced by the fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Thursday said Sudan is experiencing the worst cholera outbreak the country has seen in years, fuelled by the ongoing civil war.

The fighting escalated this week into <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c890dx9vk8do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">one of the most intense RSF attacks on the city yet.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the north and centre of the country where the army has wrestled back territory from the RSF, food and medical aid have begun to make a dent in civilian suffering. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the situation is desperate in the conflict zones of western and southern Sudan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the Matbakh-al-Khair communal kitchen in el-Fasher late last month, volunteers turned ambaz into a porridge. This is the residue of peanuts after the oil has been extracted, normally fed to animals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sometimes it is possible to find sorghum or millet but on the day of filming, the kitchen manager says: \"There is no flour or bread.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Now we've reached the point of eating ambaz. May God relieve us of this calamity, there's nothing left in the market to buy,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN has amplified its appeal for a humanitarian pause to allow food convoys into the city, with its Sudan envoy Sheldon Yett once more demanding this week that the warring sides observe their obligations under international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The army has given clearance for the trucks to proceed but the UN is still waiting for official word from the paramilitary group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">RSF advisers have said they believed the truce would be used to facilitate the delivery of food and ammunition to the army's \"besieged militias\" inside el-Fasher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They have also claimed the paramilitary group and its allies were setting up \"safe routes\" for civilians to leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF have issued a statement denying widespread allegations that it was targeting civilians in el-Fasher, claiming that local armed groups in the city were using civilians as human shields.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For residents of the city, the battle is to remain alive during bombardments and scrounge what food they can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local responders can receive some emergency cash via a digital banking system, but it does not go very far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The prices in the markets have exploded,\" says Mathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today, $5,000 [£3,680] covers one meal for 1,500 people in a single day.

She is seven months pregnant, gaunt and exhausted. Her story is a tale of trauma told by many.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She tells us she used to trade when she had a little money, before fleeing el-Fasher. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her husband was captured by armed men on the road to Tawila.

He defended them on Thursday and did not seem willing to back down in the face of the lawsuit threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Donald Trump was a friend of Epstein, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s because the financier poached employees from the spa in Trump's Florida golf club. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A letter from the first lady's lawyers and addressed to an attorney for Hunter Biden demands he retract the claim and apologise, or face legal action for \"over $1bn in damages\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says the first lady has suffered \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm\" because of the claim he repeated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also accuses the youngest Biden son of having a \"vast history of trading on the names of others\", and repeating the claim \"to draw attention to yourself\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During a wide-ranging interview with filmmaker Andrew Callaghan published earlier this month, Hunter Biden claimed unreleased documents relating to Epstein would \"implicate\" President Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said: \"Epstein introduced Melania to Trump - the connections are so wide and deep.\" The first lady's legal letter notes the claim was partially attributed to Michael Wolff, a journalist who authored a critical biography of the president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a recent interview with US outlet the Daily Beast, Wolff reportedly claimed that the first lady was known to an associate of Epstein and Trump when she met her now-husband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The outlet later retracted the story after receiving a letter from the first lady's attorney that challenged the contents and framing of the story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked during an interview on the YouTube show Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan if he would apologise, Biden said \"not going to happen\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Biden said in the interview posted on Thursday that he did not think \"these threats of a lawsuit add up to anything other than a designed distraction\". But he noted that if the lawsuit was filed, he would be able to collect testimony from both Trumps through depositions and he was \"more than happy to provide them the platform\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no evidence the Trumps were introduced to each other by Epstein, who took his own life in prison while awaiting trial in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the first lady's legal letter, Hunter Biden is accused of relying on a since-removed article as the basis of his claims, which it describes as \"false and defamatory\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A message on the archived version of the Daily Beast online story reads: \"After this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump's attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Asked about the legal threat, the first lady's lawyer, Alejandro Brito, referred BBC News to a statement issued by her aide, Nick Clemens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It read: \"First Lady Melania Trump's attorneys are actively ensuring immediate retractions and apologies by those who spread malicious, defamatory falsehoods.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A January 2016 profile by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a13529/melania-trump-interview-0216/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Harper's Bazaar</a> reported the first lady met her husband in November 1998, at a party hosted by the founder of a modelling agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Melania Trump, 55, told the publication she declined to give him her phone number because he was \"with a date\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The profile said Trump had recently separated from his second wife, Marla Maples, whom he divorced in 1999. He was previously married to Ivana Trump between 1977 and 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has contacted Hunter Biden's attorney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The legal letter comes after weeks of pressure on the White House to release the so-called Epstein files, previously undisclosed documents relating to the criminal investigation against the convicted paedophile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before being re-elected, Trump said he would release the records if he returned to office, but the FBI and justice department said in July that no \"incriminating\" client list of Epstein associates existed.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Europeans sought to find a quicker trade route with these areas by sailing west, but in doing so landed on the Americas instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cortés would go on to explore north-western Mexico and the Baja California peninsula.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The document's repatriation comes at a time of political tension between Mexico and the US over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and illegal migration across the US-Mexico border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the FBI says that, as one of the largest consumers of antiquities, the US had a responsibility to counter the trafficking of artefacts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Dittmer said: \"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The FBI said it was determined to locate and repatriate the other pages still missing from the collection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another document signed by Cortés was returned to Mexico by the FBI in 2023.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm a born rebel,\" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged. \"I have a very rebellious character.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab02/live/1c6fd9f0-7740-11f0-813c-29678c441e36.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Jimmy Lai, in a gray suit and black pants, poses for a photograph during an interview with AFP news agency in Hong Kong\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Lai is on trial for breaching national security and colluding with foreign forces</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the most prominent person charged under <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52765838\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the controversial national security law</a> which China introduced in 2020, in response to massive protests which erupted in Hong Kong the year before. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The legislation criminalises a wider range of dissenting acts which Beijing considers subversion and secession, among other things.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing says the national security law is necessary to maintain stability in Hong Kong but critics say it has effectively outlawed dissent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, Lai's son Sebastien has called for his release. In February, the younger Lai urged Starmer and US President Donald Trump to take urgent action, adding that his father's \"body is breaking down\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of Lai's trial on Thursday, Sebastien told the BBC that even if his father got just five years in prison, it was \"practically the same as a death penalty.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Given his age, given his health, yeah. He will die in prison,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sebastien added that Lai's case was \"crucial for China-UK relations\".

He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989, Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2288/live/0f196ef0-7741-11f0-9cb9-4b17a25d293a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Lai, dressed in a gray suit and beige pants, walks handcuffed and flanked by three police officers to a police van\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Lai is among the most prominent people charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Lai had been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on the mainland he is viewed as a \"traitor\" who threatens Chinese national security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent years, masked attackers firebombed Lai's house and company headquarters.

Second-guessing Trump's aims is harder, as he has recently made vacillating statements about his Russian counterpart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here's a fuller look at what the two leaders might want from the meeting.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Putin eyes international recognition... and more</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"by-russia-editor-steve-rosenberg\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"><b id=\"by-russia-editor-steve-rosenberg\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">By Russia editor Steve Rosenberg</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The first thing Putin wants from this summit is something he's already been given.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that's recognition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Recognition from the world's most powerful country, America, that Western efforts to isolate the Kremlin leader have failed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fact that this high-level meeting is happening is testament to that, as is the joint press conference that the Kremlin has announced. The Kremlin can argue that Russia is back at the top table of global politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So much for being isolated,\" crowed the tabloid Moskovsky Komsomolets earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only has Putin secured a US-Russia summit, but a prime location for it. Alaska has much to offer the Kremlin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">First, security. At its closest point, mainland Alaska is just 90km (55 miles) from Russia's Chukotka. Vladimir Putin can get there without flying over \"hostile\" nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Second, it's a long way - a very long way - from Ukraine and Europe. That sits well with the Kremlin's determination to sideline Kyiv and EU leaders, and deal directly with America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There's historical symbolism, too. The fact that Tsarist Russia sold Alaska to America in the 19th Century is being used by Moscow to justify its attempt to change borders by force in the 21st Century.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Alaska is a clear example that state borders can change, and that large territories can switch ownership,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Putin wants more than just international recognition and symbols.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He wants victory. He's been insisting that Russia keep all the land it has seized and occupied in four Ukrainian regions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson) and that Kyiv withdraw from the parts of those regions still under Ukrainian control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine this is unacceptable. \"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier,\" says the country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Kremlin knows that. But if it secures Trump's support for its territorial demands, the calculation may be that rejection by Ukraine would result in Trump cutting all support for Kyiv. Meanwhile, Russia and the US would get on with boosting relations and developing economic cooperation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is another scenario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's economy is under pressure. The budget deficit is rising, income from oil and gas exports falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If economic problems are pushing Putin to end the war, the Kremlin may compromise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For now, there's no sign of that - with Russian officials continuing to insist that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Trump seeks chance to claim progress toward peace</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"by-north-america-correspondent-anthony-zurcher\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"><b id=\"by-north-america-correspondent-anthony-zurcher\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">By North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump famously promised during his 2024 presidential campaign that ending the Ukraine war would be easy and that he could do it in a matter of days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That promise has hung over the American president's efforts to resolve the conflict, as he has alternated between frustration with the Ukrainians and the Russians since returning to the White House in January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He harangued Zelensky at a dramatic White House meeting in February, and later temporarily suspended military aid and intelligence sharing with the war-torn nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent months, he's been more critical of Putin's intransigence and willingness to attack civilian targets, setting a series of deadlines for new sanctions on the Russians and other nations that do business with them. Last Friday was the most recent deadline, and as with all the ones before it, Trump ultimately backed away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now he's hosting the Russian president on American soil and talking about \"land-swapping\", which Ukraine fears may consist of land concessions in exchange for peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, any discussion about what Trump wants during his Friday talks with Putin is muddied by the president's vacillating statements and actions.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'We're going to change the battle lines' Trump on the war in Ukraine</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This week, Trump has made a concerted effort to lower the expectations for this meeting - perhaps a tacit acknowledgement of the limited possibilities of a breakthrough with only one party in the war present. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, he said the summit would be a \"feel-out\" meeting. He suggested that he would know if he could reach a deal with the Russian leader \"probably in the first two minutes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I may leave and say good luck, and that'll be the end,\" he added. \"I may say this is not going to be settled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Tuesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reinforced this message, calling the summit a \"listening session\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, it's often best to expect the unexpected. And Zelensky and European leaders spoke to him on Wednesday in an effort to ensure that he doesn't strike a deal with Putin that Ukraine won't - or can't - accept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One thing has been clear practically all year, however: Trump would welcome the chance to be the man who ends the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his inaugural address, he said he wanted his proudest legacy to be that of a \"peacemaker\". It is no secret that he longs for the international recognition of a Nobel Peace Prize.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump is not one to get bogged down in details. But if there is an opportunity for him to claim that he has made progress toward peace during the talks in Anchorage, he will take it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin, always a savvy negotiator, may seek a way to let Trump do just that – on Russia's terms, of course.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Follow BBC's coverage of the war in Ukraine</h2></p></article></div></body></html>"

Russia now controls rather less territory - down from about 27% in the spring of 2022 to around 20% now. In the east, Russian forces are advancing, but very slowly and at great cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now. European allies also insist on a halt in fighting. US President Donald Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin,  Trump has started talking, instead about territorial swaps. That has sent shockwaves across Kyiv and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows:</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Kyiv, such a concession would be a bitter pill to swallow. For Moscow, whose losses have been even more catastrophic, it would be seen as victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine \"could not\" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pushing hard, and making progress, near the town of Dobropillya. But it's not yet clear whether this marks a significant strategic move or just an effort to show Trump that Moscow has the upper hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What about Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, captured in 2022? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here, it's reported, Russia is offering to halt its offensive and freeze the lines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But would Russia be prepared to give any of it back? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Trump talked vaguely about \"ocean-front property\" – presumably a reference to some of this shoreline, along the Sea of Azov or Black Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is all part of Putin's strategically vital land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's hard to see the Russian leader agreeing to give any of it up. Like Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin regards these places as part of Russia, and illegally annexed them three years ago in four referendums widely regarded as a sham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine, and Europe, territorial swaps – at this very early stage of the talks – are a non-starter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A discussion about future borders may eventually come, but only when the war has stopped and Ukraine's security has been guaranteed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But in the court, no amount of expert-like confidence could undo the prosecution's case - a spouse murdered and a motive rooted in suspicion and marital discord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month the High Court dismissed Mamta Pathak's appeal and upheld her life sentence for the April 2021 murder of her husband, Neeraj Pathak, a retired physician.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Pathak mounted a spirited, self-argued defence - invoking gaps in the autopsy, the insulation of the house, and even an electrochemical theory - the court found the circumstantial evidence conclusive: she had drugged her husband with sleeping pills and then electrocuted him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In court, Mamta, a mother of two, had peered over a stack of overflowing case files, leafing through them before she grew animated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sir, electric burn marks can't be distinguished as ante-mortem [before death] or post-mortem [after death],\" she argued quoting from a forensics book.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"How did they [doctors] write it was an electric burn mark in post-mortem [report]?\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Microscopically, electrical burns look the same before and after death, making standard examination inconclusive, say experts. A close study of dermal changes may reveal whether a burn was ante- or post-mortem, according to one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925207/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">paper</a>. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The courtroom video of Mamta Pathak arguing her case in the high court went viral</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An impromptu exchange on chemical reactions followed, with the judge probing her on laboratory processes. Mamta spoke about different acids, explaining that distinctions could be made using an electron microscope - something not possible in a post-mortem room. She tried to walk the judge through electron microscopy and different acids. Three women lawyers in the background smiled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta ploughed on - she said she had been studying law in prison for a year. Flipping through her tabbed files with stickers and quoting from forensic medicine books, she pointed to alleged gaps in the investigation - from the unexamined crime scene to the absence of qualified electrical and forensic experts at the scene of the crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our house was insured from 2017 to 2022, and inspections confirmed it was protected against electrical fire,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta told the court that her husband had high blood pressure and heart disease. She stated the actual cause of death was narrowing and \"calcification of his coronary arteries due to old age\". She also suggested he may have slipped and sustained a hematoma, but no CT scan was conducted to confirm this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Neeraj Pathak, 65, had been found dead at the family home on 29 April 2021. The autopsy ruled electrocution as the cause of death. Days later, Mamta had been arrested and charged with murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Police had seized an 11-meter electric wire with a two-pin plug, and CCTV footage from the couple's house. Six tablets of a sleeping pill were recovered in a strip of 10.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The postmortem report cited cardiorespiratory shock from electrical current at multiple sites as the cause of death, occurring 36 to 72 hours before the autopsy conducted on 1 May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But they didn't find my fingerprints on the strip of tablets,\" Mamta told the judges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But her arguments quickly unravelled, leaving Judges Agarwal and Devnarayan Sinha unconvinced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For nearly four decades, Mamta and Neeraj Pathak had lived a seemingly orderly middle-class life in Chhatarpur - a drought-prone district of Madhya Pradesh known for its farms, granite quarries, and small businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She taught chemistry at the local government college; he was the chief medical officer at the district hospital. They raised two sons - one settled abroad, the other, sharing a home with his mother. Neeraj retired voluntarily in 2019 after 39 years as a government doctor and then opened a private clinic at home.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Mamta Pathak taught chemistry at a government college for 36 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The incident happened during the pandemic. Neeraj was showing Covid symptoms and kept to the first floor. Mamta and her son, Nitish, stayed downstairs. Two staircases from the ground floor linked Neeraj's rooms to the open gallery and waiting hall of his private clinic, where half a dozen staff bustled between the lab and the medical store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 97-page judgment stated that Mamta reported finding her husband Neeraj unresponsive in his bed on 29 April, but did not inform a doctor or the police until 1 May. Instead, she took her elder son to Jhansi - over 130km away - without clear reason, according to the driver, and returned the same evening. She claimed ignorance about how he died when she finally alerted the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beneath this silence lay a troubled marriage. The judges highlighted longstanding marital discord, with the couple living apart and Mamta suspecting her husband of infidelity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the morning of the day he died,, Neeraj had called an associate, alleging that Mamta was \"torturing him,\" locking him in a bathroom, withholding food for days, and causing physical injuries. He also accused her of taking cash, ATM cards, vehicle keys, and bank fixed deposit documents. Pleading for help, Neeraj's son contacted a friend who alerted the police, who then rescued the retired doctor from what was described as \"Mamta's custody\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The couple had even lived apart in recent times, adding weight to the court's doubts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta had told the court she was the \"best mother,\" presenting a birthday card from her children as proof. She also showed photos of herself feeding her husband and snapshots with family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet, the judges were unmoved. They noted that such tokens of affection didn't erase motive - after all, a \"doting mother\" can also be a \"suspicious wife,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fifty minutes into her deposition, after parrying questions and defending herself against the court's doubts, Mamta's composure faltered for the first time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I know one thing… I did not kill him,\" she said, her voice trailing off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another moment, she confessed, \"I can't take this very much more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trying to ease the tension, Judge Agarwal remarked, \"You must be used to this… you must be taking classes for 50 minutes in college.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Forty minutes, sir. But they are small children,\" Mamta said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Small children in college? But your designation is assistant professor,\" the judge pressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But they are kids, sir,\" she replied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Don't tell us such stories,\" Judge Agarwal interrupted sharply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta fought not just as a defendant, but as a teacher turning the courtroom into a chemistry lab - hoping to prove her innocence through science. Yet in the end, the cold facts proved stronger than her lessons.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's always going to go back to my music,\" she said, joking that some fans are so good at decoding her that it's almost gotten a bit \"zodiac killer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The secret messages are \"something that you don't know I'm saying for a specific reason, but you'll go back and be like, 'Oh my God!'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said her favourite example was a speech she gave when she received an honorary doctorate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I put so many lyrical Easter eggs in that speech that when the Midnights album came out, after that, the fans were like, 'The whole speech was an Easter egg!'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She also spoke about her love of numbers and dates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I love math stuff,\" she said, saying 13 was her favourite number. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Travis, she said, is \"87\" - the number he wears on his game jersey - and she noted that 13 plus 87 equals 100.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of her hidden messages are so complex, she said, they are crafted \"upside down, backwards in Braille\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The podcast 'got me a boyfriend'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Near the beginning of the show, Swift was asked why she chose to appear on the podcast, which caters primarily to sports fans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This podcast got me a boyfriend,\" she said, accusing Travis of using the broadcast as his \"personal dating app\" to connect with her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before they even met, Travis famously gushed on the podcast about attending one of Swift's concerts and being disappointed when they couldn't meet. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He talked about making her a beaded friendship bracelet, which were popular during the Eras Tour, and said he wanted to give her his phone number. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said the clip, which went viral, felt almost like \"he was standing outside of my apartment, holding a boom box saying, 'I want to go on a date with you'\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Family and friends then started persuading her to take him up on his offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My relatives, my cousins, were like, 'Please, please, please, he's amazing'. There were friends that were like, 'He's actually an amazing guy, he's so great'. There was a lot of people whispering in my ear about you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said it was exactly the moment she had \"been writing songs about, wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was wild, but it worked... He's the good kind of crazy,\" she said, calling her boyfriend \"a human exclamation point\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Sourdough bread baked with cat and chest hair</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She and Travis spoke fondly about their love, describing how they bake sourdough bread together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His dough winds up with chest hair in it, while hers has extra cat hair, she joked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I had never experienced something so mesmerising on stage, and then so real and beautiful in person,\" said Travis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jason then joked that maybe he should leave, and give them some privacy, as Swift swooned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Yeah I think so, honestly,\" Swift responded. \"At this point, I think everyone should leave.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Swift has at times been shy about discussing her relationship in public, Travis has been more outspoken. Before the podcast aired, he told GQ in an interview: \"I love being the happiest guy in the world.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Her 'granny' hobbies</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As well as baking, Swift revealed the other \"granny\" hobbies she has got back into now her tour is over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'd say all my hobbies could be categorised as hobbies you could have had in the 1700s,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I like to sew,\" she said, telling Jason she specialises \"as you know in children's purses and baby blankets\" - obviously a reference to gifts she's made for his young children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I love to paint, I love to cook, I have a different baking obsession every six months.

Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Will the gamble pay off? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. \"It's day to day,\" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,\" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why rare earths matter</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The phrase \"rare earths\" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors  - is something of a misnomer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,\" Professor Eksteen explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windscreen wipers and braking sensors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact \"somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck\", Professor Eksteen adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,\" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,\" Professor Eksteen explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,\" says Mr McGrath.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Australian resources minister Madeliene King sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,\" Mr McGrath says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A strategic necessity</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies – making their control a pressing national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn't exist. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,\" Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,\" Ms King adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry – pollution.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Labourers work at the site of a rare earth metals mine at Nancheng county, Jiangxi province\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Critics say China's environmental protections and regulations are weak</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In China, environmental damage from years of processing rare earths has led to chemicals and radioactive waste seeping into waterways - cities and people bearing the scars of decades of poor regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With rare earths, it's not so much about the mining footprint, rather the processing that is a dirty business – because it involves extraction, leaching, thermal cracking and refining which produce radioactive components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think there is no metal industry that is completely clean... unfortunately, it's a matter of picking your poison sometimes,\" Professor Eksteen says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Australia, we've got mechanisms to handle that. We've got a legal environment and a framework to work with that to at least deal with it responsibly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The EU has in the past accused China of using a \"quasi monopoly\" on rare earths as a bargaining chip, weaponising it to undermine competitors in key industries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The bloc - which is home to hundreds of auto manufacturers that so desperately need rare earths - said even if China has loosened restrictions on supplies, the threat of supply chain shocks remains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even if building a brand new industry will take time, Australia seems to have a lot going for it in the rare earths race, as it tries to be a more reliable and cleaner source.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And one that - crucially - is independent of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jaltson-akkanath-chummar\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
