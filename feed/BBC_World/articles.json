Just murders, just click, clack, bang. It’s not a drama, it’s not a movie, it’s a real life,” he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Russian government says its armed forces “operate with utmost restraint, as far as possible under the conditions of a high-intensity conflict, treating their personnel with maximum care”. “Information regarding alleged violations and crimes is duly investigated,” it added.“We are unable to independently verify the accuracy or authenticity of the information you have provided,” it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz7gw3l395ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Read more about this story here.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"the-zero-line:-inside-russia's-war-available-on-iplayer-now-and-bbc2-at-9pm-tonight.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">The Zero Line: Inside Russia's War available on iPlayer now and BBC2 at 9pm tonight.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"
