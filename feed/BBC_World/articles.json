They quickly spread across the country, and within days there were hundreds of protesters in the Hakim Nezami and Khaghani neighbourhoods of Isfahan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There were women and men from seven to 70 years old,\" she said. \"On just one street there were 200 to 300 people. People were chanting 'Death to the dictator' and 'Long live the shah'.\" The \"dictator\" was Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the shah a reference to Iran's late last monarch, overthrown in the 1979 Islamic revolution, and his son, the exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Isfahan has seen protests and crackdowns down the years. But Parnia said she had never seen anything like what happened during the recent unrest, which was sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First, security forces fired tear gas at the protesters, she said. Then they formed a line and fired birdshot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I saw people getting shot and falling down, and I saw blood on the street.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parnia said she ran away down alleyways and was suddenly pulled into an apartment block by a woman.

Nobody could call their families, and many refused to go to hospitals, fearing they could be arrested there,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All the nurses could do was clean the wounds and send them home. The next day you could still smell the tear gasses in the air.

Many foreign airlines were cancelled and people were frustrated.

Some doctors are referring them to surgeons who can treat them in private clinics,\" Parnia's cited her friends as saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Iranian authorities have said around 3,000 people were killed during the protests, US-based human rights group HRANA has so far confirmed more than 4,600 deaths, with another 9,700 cases still under review. According to the group, at least 7,300 people have also sustained serious injuries.

The prime minster had indicated last week he would accept Trump's offer on principle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Ottawa had indicated in recent days that it would not pay the $1bn (£740m) membership fee which Trump has said permanent members will be asked to pay to help fund the board.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's Board of Peace was originally thought to be aimed at helping end the two-year war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and oversee reconstruction. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BBC looks into who is and isn't on Trump's Board of Peace</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But its proposed charter does not mention the Palestinian territory and appears to be designed to supplant functions of the UN.

They were due to be exported to the US for auction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The objects belong to his eldest daughter, Makaziwe Mandela and Christo Brand, a Robben Island warden during Mandela's incarceration. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-68031028\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In trying to stop their sale</a>, the authorities said they were part of the country's heritage and were therefore legally protected from export.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The South African Heritage Resources Agency (Sahra) first found out about the potential sale in a British newspaper article from late 2021, claiming that the key would go for more than £1m ($1.35m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency then wrote to the US auction house, Guernsey, that was planning the sale to ask it to suspend the auction and return the assets to South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other items in the lot were a copy of the 1996 South African Constitution personally signed by Mandela, one of his charcoal drawings, an ID card, a tennis racquet he used on Robben Island and gifts from world leaders, including one from former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mandela's daughter wanted to use the proceeds from the sale to build a memorial garden at the late former president's grave in Qunu, in Mthatha, Eastern Cape province.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its ruling, the Supreme Court of Appeal argued that Sahra's interpretation of what items fell under the National Heritage Resources Act was overly broad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling also states that whereas Makaziwe and Brand explained in detail why their respective assets were not heritage objects, Sahra made no attempt to explain on what grounds it believed they were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not yet clear whether the authorities will seek other legal avenues to block the sale. The BBC has contacted the sport, arts and culture department for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Makaziwe, Mandela's only daughter with his first wife, welcomed the Supreme Court's judgment, blasting the heritage agency for presuming \"to know my father's last wishes better than those who were beside him at the end - his family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody is more invested in ensuring Tata's [Mandela's] legacy endures in the way he would want to be remembered than those who carry his name,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that no decision had yet been made on what would happen to the items meant to go on auction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some supporters of the government's position argued that items connected to Mandela should not be sold or exported but instead kept in South Africa for future generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others believe that Mandela's family should decide what happens to the objects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He led the African National Congress in its struggle against apartheid - a system of legally enforced racism - and was released from prison in 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 along with then-President FW de Klerk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected president in 1994.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">You may also be interested in:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

The latest fighting has threatened Jonglei's capital, Bor, two hours' drive from Juba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">SPLA-IO's leader, suspended First Vice-President Riek Machar, is currently on trial on charges of murder, treason and crimes against humanity, which he denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are fears that the fighting could re-ignite a full-blown civil war in the country.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conflict in South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, broke out in 2013, two years after independence, when President Salva Kiir accused Machar of plotting to overthrow him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2018 peace deal ended the civil war that had killed nearly 400,000 people, but it has never been properly implemented and the relationship between Kiir and Machar has become increasingly strained amid ethnic tensions and sporadic violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reinforcements from the South Sudanese army have now been deployed to Bor, which was the first place to be captured by opposition forces in the 2013-2018 conflict. The town is seen as a strategic staging post on the way to the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We brought you here for a mission,\" chief of the defence force Gen Paul Nang Majok told his troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am giving you seven days only to finish the mission – to crush the rebellion in those areas and recapture them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The South Sudanese army is being supported by soldiers from Uganda. Their exact number is not known. One report put the figure at 4,000, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The soldiers are now preparing to advance into the areas held by SPLA-IO forces, national broadcaster SSBC has reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts believe the threats by the SPLA-IO forces to advance towards Juba with the aim of occupying it are meant to put pressure on the government to release Machar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Kiir sacked Machar's wife, Angelina Teny, from her position as interior minister in the unity government and replaced her with someone from his own party. The move sparked criticism and worries that it could escalate the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN's peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, Unmiss, has called for an immediate cessation of hostilities in Jonglei and other areas experiencing violence in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unmiss acting head of mission Kiki Gbeho urged the leaders of South Sudan to commit to \"immediately ceasing hostilities, de-escalating tensions, and advancing reconciliation and peace through inclusive dialogue under the framework of the peace agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan also expressed alarm at the deteriorating political and security situation and had a similar message to Unmiss.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commission chair Yasmin Sooka expressed deep alarm at the reports of repeated airstrikes in parts of Jonglei, which have killed and injured civilians, destroyed homes, markets and medical facilities, and triggered large-scale displacement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, SPLA-IO acting chief of staff, Lt Gen Peter Thok Chuol Luak, issued a warning to Juba's residents, saying its forces would launch attacks near the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This warning precedes imminent military confrontations in Juba. We strongly recommend that all South Sudanese citizens in areas on the outskirts of Juba either evacuate or remain indoors,\" Gen Thok wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor of the state that includes Juba, Emmanuel Adil Anthony, has urged residents to ignore the threats made by the SPLA-IO.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Yet 42 sanctioned tankers tracked by BBC Verify passing through the English Channel did so after that advice was received.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among them was the Sofos - a tanker sanctioned by the UK Foreign Office in May 2025. It moved through the Channel after travelling from Venezuela and is now near the Russian city of St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ship-tracking data shows the Sofos loaded oil in Russia in mid-November, before travelling to Turkey and then to Venezuela, where it switched off its tracking signal.

The ship was sanctioned by the UK in May 2025 and according to Anna Zhminko, an analyst at Maritime Intelligence firm Vortexa, has been part of the shadow fleet since 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November the ship had a makeover, changing its name from Blint and switching to a Russian registry after falsely flying under the Comoros flag. It left Russia in late December and just days after the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy8pn7jgy3no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BBC reported on the UK's legal advice</a> it entered the Channel carrying about 100,000 tonnes of Urals crude, Russia's flagship oil grade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shadow fleet has helped Russia to mitigate the impact of an embargo imposed on its oil exports since 2022 and has helped prop up an economy battered by Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January, Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the British government <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0lx42jrg7do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was ready to \"tighten the chokehold\" on Russia</a> and take new \"assertive actions\" against shadow fleet vessels. Her comments came after officials were told troops could board and seize tankers under the Sanctions and Money Act 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the UK has aided US forces to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y2v8ngl14o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seize a tanker near Iceland in early January</a> and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdexxr2y907o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">France in the Mediterranean on Thursday</a>, British troops are yet to independently seize any shadow fleet vessels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is despite BBC Verify identifying six tankers operating in the Channel under false flags since the beginning of January. This means the ships are not registered in the states they publicly claim to be registered in.

Alongside our allies, we are stepping up our response to shadow vessels – and we will continue to do so.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Tankers ignore UK warnings</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other tankers which have been sanctioned by the US and EU, but not the UK, have also sailed through the Channel over the course of January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify identified one vessel that took extreme measures to avoid detection and has been labelled by maritime experts as \"the darkest of the dark fleet\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arcusat - previously sanctioned by the US as the Tia, before changing its identity in 2024 - passed through the Channel on 8 January before being stopped by German federal police and turned around before it entered the country's waters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, it obtained a new IMO number in a move that analysts said was almost unheard of. The unique code identifies ships and is supposed to be associated with a vessel for life, irrespective of changes of name or ownership.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite mounting calls for tougher enforcement, shadow fleet vessels remain difficult to monitor. Sanctioned tankers will deploy several strategies to evade detection - including flying under false flags, switching off their tracking signals, and broadcasting false locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once vessels start doing these direct port calls within Russia, they're less afraid of compliance,\" Zhminko told BBC Verify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because it is already sanctioned it is easier for her to be a part of the open shadow fleet - she can't do any mainstream market port calls because she is already sanctioned.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), the shadow fleet tankers move between $87bn-$100bn worth of oil per year. Vaibhav Raghunandan, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said that 68% of all Russian crude oil was carried on sanctioned tankers in December 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mike Martin MP said that the revenue generated by the shadow fleet was helping to fund Russia's war in Ukraine and providing the Kremlin with an economic lifeline. He said the conflict would only come to an end \"when Russia's economy collapses\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A key lever we have to pull is knock out oil sales through the shadow fleet,\" Martin told BBC Verify. \"So I think it's massively important, it's irritating we didn't get on it much earlier.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-matt-murphy,-jack-fenwick-and-joshua-cheetham.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Matt Murphy, Jack Fenwick and Joshua Cheetham.</i></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"correction:-the-general-skobelev-is-the-name-of-the-sanctioned-russian-tanker-that-was-in-the-channel,-not-the-warship-escorting-it.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Correction: The General Skobelev is the name of the sanctioned Russian tanker that was in the Channel, not the warship escorting it.</i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

But killings on such a large scale are rare and have elicited outrage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stray animals - mostly dogs but also cattle and monkeys - are considered a persistent problem in many parts of India, where they are often blamed for attacks on people, crop damage and traffic accidents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The problem is attributed to a combination of factors, including gaps in sterilisation and vaccination programmes, rubbish piling up, abandonment of animals, shrinking forest habitats and uneven enforcement of laws. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While stray dogs, in particular, are often enmeshed in the fabric of daily life, forming strong bonds with local communities, animal rights activists have frequently flagged cruelty towards them, warning that the country does not have strong enough penalties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Telangana state minister Danasari Anasuya Seethakka <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/minister-seethakka-urges-gps-to-adopt-humane-methods-in-tackling-stray-dog-menace-deplores-killing-of-animals/article70533892.ece?utm_sf_cserv_ref=20751449&amp;utm_sf_post_ref=656668942\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the Hindu newspaper</a> that the killings were \"illegal\" and \"inhumane\", warning that those responsible would face strict action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue of how to handle stray dogs is also being debated at present in the Supreme Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August last year, the court <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly665zjg2eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">ordered authorities in Delhi and its suburbs</a> to move all stray dogs from streets to animal shelters in just two months. After widespread protests, the court modified the order, asking for the animals to be immunised and vaccinated before being released back to their neighbourhoods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Animal welfare groups argue that putting dogs into already-overburdened shelters is unscientific, while those seeking removal of stray dogs from public places say unchecked populations is endangering people's lives and livelihoods.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c403/live/05c87420-f83a-11f0-9942-9d94373efa41.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An elderly woman wrapped in a shawl sits on a pavement as a white-coloured stray dog gently tries to nuzzle her.

It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is \"primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access\", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,\" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a \"business president\" who believed the island represented \"a more robust trading opportunity\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to \"shift the dial\" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,\" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, \"it's all still about potential\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"His logic is that there's a national security imperative,\" Spence said. \"My belief is that this is much more economically driven.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-natalie-sherman\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

It could give a platform to antisemites, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Royal commissions had not been launched into previous tragedies like Port Arthur, Albanese pointed out, comments which were widely dismissed. Promised reviews of intelligence agencies and law enforcement similarly did nothing to dissuade those calling for the inquiry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their pleas were mirrored by a coordinated campaign of letter writing that featured on the front pages of right-wing newspapers. \"I don't think it's controversial to say that the News Limited and other parts of the media were certainly stirring the pot,\" says Warhurst.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese's arguments against a royal commission were \"really hard to make in these circumstances\", says Kenny, and it backfired on him when he was ultimately forced to reverse course on the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have also suggested his reluctance may have been down to fears it could become complex, controversial and divisive. It could invite discussion of the war in Gaza, while potentially excluding examination of Islamophobia – which exploded after Bondi, with The Islamophobia Register Australia recording a 740% rise in incidents by early January - when many Labor MPs have large Muslim electorates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was likely also a \"reluctance to cave to the opposition\", Farr believes: opposition leader Sussan Ley had vociferously demanded the royal commission, asking what Albanese was \"hiding\", and revelled in his backflip.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A political opportunity</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is fair to say that, before December's attack, Ley had been struggling to land a punch on the government and assert authority over her own party. In the weeks before the shooting, some pundits were even predicting her imminent ousting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Bondi attacks offered her an opportunity to prosecute a very strong case against the government,\" says Kenny.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any momentum she gained over the royal commission collapsed this week when she failed to rally her Coalition behind the very hate speech laws she had so loudly demanded Albanese quickly implement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By Thursday - the national day of mourning for the Bondi attacks - things had fallen apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Party announced they were leaving the coalition, having refused to vote for the legislation despite a shadow cabinet agreement. They, despite earlier calls for haste, said they had not been given enough time to examine the proposals which they said could threaten free speech. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a05/live/00075840-f749-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Australian Broadcasting Corporation Sussan Ley and David Littleproud\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">David Littleproud on Thursday said his National Party would not work with Sussan Ley</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On his way out the door, Nationals leader David Littleproud suggested the only way his party would consider returning to the fold was if Ley was dumped, leaving her already shaky leadership hanging by a thread.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm quite sure there are people... who are polishing their shoes and tightening the knot on their ties to step forward should that vacancy occur or be forced,\" says Farr.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Littleproud's bold ultimatum could be an overstep which costs him his own job, with mutterings that Liberals wouldn't accept him as a leader in any future coalition either.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, it seems all of Australia's politicians may be on shakier ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The posturing of the main parties over the past month has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many Australians.

Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine.

First, he announced a complete overhaul of Vietnam's administration, slashing layers of bureaucracy, cutting the number of provinces from 63 to 34, and laying off at least 100,000 government employees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came Resolution 68, passed on 4 May last year at a meeting of the politburo, the highest decision-making body between party congresses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another country, its statement that the private sector will be \"the most important driving force of the national economy\" would be unremarkable. It was a barely noticeable change from the government's previous stance that it  was \"one important driving force\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in officially socialist Vietnam it marked a sea change, for the first time putting privately-owned businesses on the same level as state-run companies, which in the past had always been extolled as the bedrock of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting in May also announced breathtakingly ambitious targets for the economy: double digit annual growth, doubling the number of private businesses by 2030, and by 2045, the centenary of Vietnam's declaration of independence from French colonial rule, to have created an upper-income, knowledge- and technology-based economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words, to break out of the so-called \"middle income trap\". No other large South East Asian country has managed to do this.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Leading 'cranes'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A central part of his strategy is to back national champions in the private sector – \"leading cranes\" in the party's words – companies big enough to compete on the global stage. In the last Fortune 500 list of top companies in South East Asia 11 of the 100 largest were Vietnamese, and of those only four were privately-owned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most private companies are very small; only 2% employ more than 200 people. To Lam's goal is to have 20 globally competitive private companies by 2030, somewhat like the South Korean model in the 1970s of state-supported conglomerates known as chaebol, which led to the creation of global giants like Hyundai and Samsung.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vietnam's astonishing economic progress over the past 30 years has won it admiration around the world. Its record in poverty reduction is formidable. It turned an isolated, state-run economy which could barely feed its people into one of the world's manufacturing powerhouses. Yet behind these impressive achievements are some big limitations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One is the size of the state-owned sector. Even today, after all this frenetic change and growth, as of 2024, there are 671 state-owned enterprises accounting for 29% of Vietnam's GDP. Their advantages, getting preferential access to licences, government funding and resources like land make it difficult for private companies to compete and thrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even after Resolution 68 appeared to put them in second place, a new Resolution, number 79, was passed earlier this month, presumably after pushback by conservatives inside the party.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e252/live/0483b460-f814-11f0-b4d6-8ddfa2ac3bde.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images This photo taken on November 4, 2025 shows employees assembling furniture inside the Jonathan Charles Fine Furniture factory in Ho Chi Minh City.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vietnam's economy is fuelled by export-led manufacturing, which makes it especially vulnerable to Trump's tariffs</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This stated that state-owned enterprises could also be \"leading cranes\", and proposed a target of 50 from Vietnam, double the current number, reaching the Fortune 500 list for the region by 2030.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another is the dependence of many Vietnamese industries on foreign investment, foreign technology and overseas markets. Vietnam has become an efficient, low-cost manufacturer of other countries' products. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To Lam himself spoke of this in January last year: \"What percentage of the value do we contribute here? Or are we at the lowest end of the value chain, mainly doing outsourcing for foreign companies? If a shirt is sold with the design, fabric, dye, thread and buttons all sourced from someone else, what do we get?  Perhaps only labour costs and environmental pollution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact the largest manufacturing company there is South Korean, Samsung, and it relies heavily on imported components and technology to make its phones and other electronic goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the challenge faced by most South East Asian countries. Like Vietnam, they saw their economies grow at breakneck speeds as they joined an increasingly complex global supply chain from the 1980s onwards. Poverty fell as people moved to the cities to take up low-end manufacturing jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet today countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia are stuck, seemingly unable to move up the value chain and break out of economies dependent on natural resources and manufacturing components for foreign products. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Growth is stagnating, and in Thailand the population is aging quickly. Their largest home-grown companies are in banking, property, energy, telecoms and food. There is no Thai, Malaysian or Indonesian tech giant on the horizon.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could Vietnam be different?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It does have one impressive tech company, FPT, which is now winning contracts with clients like Airbus and several large car manufacturers to help manage and upgrade software.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is reporting revenue of more than $1bn a year, employs 80,000 people across 30 countries and has even built its own university to ensure it has enough graduates with coding and English-language skills to call on. FPT is one of the \"leading cranes\" To Lam is hoping will take Vietnam out of the middle income trap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet FPT is dwarfed by the biggest of the \"leading cranes\", Vingroup, Vietnam's largest private company, which is much more like the traditional, family-owned conglomerates that dominate the economies of other South East Asian countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vingroup is massive. There are Vin homes, Vin hospitals, Vin schools and universities, Vin resorts and amusement parks, Vin solar farms. Vingroup builds expressways, and was the main bidder to build a new high-speed 1,500km (930-mile) railway from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, until it pulled out last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there is Vinfast, the company taking on China to build world-beating electric cars. So far its attempts to break into the US and European markets have been a flop, with its models dismissed as inferior to their competitors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vinfast is thought to have lost as much as $11bn since 2021, but Vingroup is so big, its founder Pham Nhat Vuong so rich, it is willing to keep subsidising its EV experiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vinfast does well at home, thanks to political support from the Communist Party, like the recent ban on all combustion-engined motorbikes in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City - Vinfast is the dominant player in electric two-wheelers.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d21b/live/fba3e660-f7b1-11f0-9746-bbf190b04917.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A blue VinFast electric car on the streets of Hanoi surrounded by mopeds.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Although Vinfast cars are yet to break into US or European markets, they are popular in Vietnam </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vingroup will be the biggest of the national champions under To Lam's grand project. But it has so far done well only in its home market, where its political connections have given it significant advantages. As it has discovered with its cars, succeeding as a global player is much harder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The main challenge remains unchanged: how to create globally competitive firms without spawning politically-connected rent-seekers\", says Nguyen Khac Giang at the ISEAS – Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To Lam's approach risks replacing one form of rent-seeking with another. If poorly executed, Vietnam could transition from inefficient state-owned enterprises extracting resources through monopoly positions, to private conglomerates doing the same through political connections. This would crowd out the small-medium enterprises that generate the most employment and innovation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No-one doubts the extraordinary drive and industriousness of the Vietnamese people, nor To Lam's determination to break out of the middle income trap. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without urgent reform we should expect failure, he said in June last year. Yet he is embarking on this journey at an especially difficult time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No other South East Asian country is as reliant as Vietnam on access to the US market, which is now uncertain after President Donald  Trump's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vietnam's famous \"bamboo diplomacy\", attempting to be friends to all, enemies to none, will also be sorely tested in the fraught international relations of the Trump II era.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Yet for the company behind such a cultural phenomenon, the last few years have been a rollercoaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Concerns over the app first surfaced more than five years ago, prompting President Trump, in his first term, to sign an executive order aimed at removing TikTok from US stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawmakers were worried that the Chinese government could access user data of the 200 million Americans who use the app and possibly manipulate their feeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To address these concerns, TikTok's parent company ByteDance launched Project Texas – storing US user data on domestic servers run by American-owned<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Oracle. The company also moved its headquarters to Singapore and Los Angeles – in part to distance itself from its Chinese roots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These were seen as significant concessions at the time. But still, in 2024 Congress passed a law threatening to ban the app outright, unless ByteDance transferred majority ownership and changed how TikTok operates in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That deal has now closed with ByteDance signing an agreement<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>to split the US app from the rest of its global business under a new consortium of companies that includes Oracle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">TikTok remains alive in a critical market, but the terms underline the compromises and limits that ByteDance - and perhaps other Chinese tech firms - may face as they try to expand globally.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How did we get here?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US-China rivalry has seen Washington and Beijing crack down on each other's firms over national security concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet in the the most recent trade war TikTok became \"low hanging fruit\" that China could offer in exchange for other important concessions, like American agricultural products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal allows China to frame the outcome as a win - exporting tech on its own terms while gaining leverage in broader trade negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ByteDance will retain access to America's 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses, but it loses control over TikTok's algorithm and data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the company will licence the algorithm to the new US entity, in a deal the Trump administration has valued at $14bn (£10bn).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"TikTok's power lies in its content graph - an algorithm that learns from thousands of user signals to deliver hyper‑relevant, highly addictive videos,\" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With a US joint venture retraining that algorithm on domestic data, the experience will change... One thing's certain: TikTok in America won't be the same.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This shift could have knock on effects for advertisers and creators because of the changes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Creators may see their engagement shrink especially because global virality will take a hit – previously content that took off in one region could become popular in the US organically. A US-only algorithm could weaken that, forcing brands to re-structure deals and perhaps having to pay more for US exposure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">TikTok's global revenue was estimated to be $20-26bn in 2024, roughly $10 billion of which came from the US with advertising accounting for a large share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The changes will likely hurt TikTok's bottom line in the US, but ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake and therefore a share of the profits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The retraining of the algorithm might also have consequences for ByteDance's technology development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Running separate US and global algorithms, split workforces, and parallel governance adds engineering costs, slows innovation, and adds to the operational complexity, says Charlie Dai Principal Analyst in Technology Architecture &amp; Delivery at Forrester.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The India experience</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ByteDance has faced political and regulatory hurdles before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The loss of India in 2020 - then TikTok's largest market, with 200 million users - was a far bigger setback than any potential disruption in the US, says Chris Stokel-Walker, author of TikTok Boom: The Inside Story of the World's Favourite App.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he says, even the India \"setback\" wasn't much of a setback. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They've continued to show growth despite these challenges.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The struggles in both the US and India share a common thread: they were triggered by geopolitical tensions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The India ban, however, was not aimed at TikTok alone - it targeted China more broadly, with roughly 200 apps blocked across the country.

What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa holds up a 14-point agreement with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), giving the government control over Kurdish-run north-eastern Syria, in Damascus, Syria (18 January 2026)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed a 14-point agreement with the SDF on Sunday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP A woman holds a rifle at a protest by Kurds against a government offensive in north-eastern Syria, in Qamishli, Syria (20 January 2026 \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Syrian Kurds stand to lose the autonomy they enjoyed for more than a decade </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, after suffering stunning<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>territorial losses, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sana.sy/en/syria/2291194/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal</a> that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations. Crucially, its members are expected to join the Syrian army and interior ministry as individuals - and not as separate units, as it had demanded - while the control of oil and gas fields, important for Syria's economic recovery, will be transferred to the government. SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF.

But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the \"original purpose\" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had \"largely expired\", and that the \"greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria\" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer,\" he points out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through

in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown \"almost gave me depression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you,\" she says. \"But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aaron Benitez says he could not study</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I could not connect with them at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online learning also came to a halt.
