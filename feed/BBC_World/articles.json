Her family said the verdict was based on extremely limited and unreliable evidence: a piece of cloth bearing the words \"Woman, Resistance, Freedom\", and an unpublished audio message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities have not yet commented on the case.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN Human Rights Council's special rapporteurs on human rights in Iran, violence against women and arbitrary executions, as well as the five members of the working group on discrimination against women and girls, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/12/un-experts-urge-iran-halt-execution-67-year-old-iranian-woman\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">warned in a joint statement</a> that Ms Tabari's case showed \"a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was arrested during a raid on her home without a judicial warrant, and was interrogated for a month while held in solitary confinement and pressured to confess to taking up arms against the state and to membership in an opposition group, according to the experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tabari was denied access to a lawyer of her choosing and was represented by a court-appointed lawyer, they said, adding that her death sentence was issued immediately after a brief hearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The severe procedural violations in this case - including the unlawful deprivation of her liberty, the denial of effective legal representation, the extraordinarily brief trial, the lack of adequate time to prepare a defence, and the use of evidence that appears insufficient to support a charge of [armed rebellion] - render any resulting conviction unsafe,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also noted that international law restricted the death penalty to the most serious crimes, meaning intentional killing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution,\" the experts added. \"Criminalising women's activism for gender equality and treating such expression as evidence of armed rebellion constitutes a grave form of gender discrimination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 400 prominent women - including several Nobel laureates, the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, and former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine - also signed a public appeal for Ms Tabari's immediate release on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Iran is today the world's number one executioner of women per capita. Zahra's case lays bare this terror: in Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The appeal was organised by Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, a UK-based group that represents the families of the thousands of political prisoners who were executed in Iran three decades ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Iranian woman, Kurdish rights activist and social worker Pakhshan Azizi, is also facing the death penalty on the same charge as Ms Tabari.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN experts have previously said Ms Azizi's sentencing appeared to be \"solely related to her legitimate work as a social worker, including her support for refugees in Iraq and Syria\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Iran Human Rights (IHR), at least 1,426 people - including 41 women - were executed in Iran in the first 11 months of 2025 - a 70% increase on the same period last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost half of those put to death as of the end of November were convicted of drug-related offences, while 53 were convicted of national security offences, the Norway-based group said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That was better than expected, and marked the strongest growth in two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report, which had been delayed by the US government shutdown, sheds light on an economy that has been buffeted by dramatic changes to trade and immigration policies, as well as persistent inflation and cuts to government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while that has led to sharp swings in some areas, such as imports and exports, the underlying economy has maintained solid momentum, outperforming many forecasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is an economy that has defied doom and gloom expectations basically since the beginning of 2022\", said Aditya Bhave, senior economist at Bank of America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's Business Today programme, Mr Bhave described the economy as \"very very resilient\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The overall growth figure for the third quarter of the year<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>was much stronger than expected, with most analysts expecting an annual pace of about 3.2%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was lifted by consumer spending that rose at an annual rate of 3.5%, compared with 2.5% in the previous quarter, despite a slowing job market, as households spent more on health care services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Imports - which count against growth - continued to decline, reflecting the wave of taxes on shipments entering the US that President Donald Trump announced this spring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile exports, which had dropped sharply,  bounced back, surging by 7.4%. Government spending also rebounded, driven by defence outlays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those gains helped to overcome a slowdown in business investment, including in intellectual property, and a housing market struggling under the weight of still-high interest rates, which have heightened affordability issues and supply constraints. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michael Pearce, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said the economy was well positioned as it headed into 2026, when it will start to feel the boost from tax cuts and the US central bank's recent moves to drop interest rates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Underlying measures are consistent with a solid expansion,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on social media, Trump celebrated the figures, saying his tariffs were responsible. He has been on the defensive amid souring consumer confidence and polls indicating dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, some analysts warned that rising prices faced by some households could  make it difficult to sustain the unusually strong pace of growth seen in the most recent quarter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the three months to September, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price index, ticked up 2.8%, compared with 2.1% in the previous quarter, according to the report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have warned that those price increases are weighing on lower and middle income households, even as higher income households continue to spend freely. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, noted that some more recent surveys and credit card data suggest that households are reining in their spending. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The weak labour market, stagnant real incomes, and exhaustion of pandemic-era excess savings all seem finally to be catching up with households,\" he said.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They're going to get blown to pieces, because we don't want our people poisoned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on state television, Maduro responded to Trump by saying: \"He would be better off in his own country dealing with economic and social issues and the world would be better off if he focused on his own country's affairs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to office in January, Trump has doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture, accusing him of being \"one of the largest narco-traffickers in the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has designated Maduro's government as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), and last week ordered a \"blockade\" of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Venezuelan government relies heavily on oil exports to finance public spending, the latest measures have sparked outrage among officials in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Venezuela's request, the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency session on Tuesday to discuss what the government has described as \"ongoing US aggression\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

However, according to British tourist Bradley Cook, another passenger on board, that briefly \"made it worse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 27-year-old told the BBC that as the rescue boat came closer to their ferry, people started to shift and put weight on one side of the ferry, causing water to fill up the hull even quicker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Cook went to the other side to climb up on the roof, from where he jumped onto the rescue ferry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some people managed to climb over to the ferry, while others swam for it, hung onto the rails and got pulled up by others.

I was more affected by the three missing people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lao media later reported that the body of the Lao woman Pany Her and a one-year-old child were found, separately, near Luang Prabang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another passenger, Gabrielius Baranovičius, 19, told the BBC that he and his friend, both of whom are from Lithuania, did not panic at first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were just joking around,\" Mr Baranovičius said, adding that his attitude quickly changed when he realised they were sinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After getting on the rescue boat, Mr Baranovičius said he starting filming what was happening on board \"but then I heard other people screaming so [I] turned off the camera and went straight to help other people in the water get on the boat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tens of thousands of tourists use slow boat and speedboat services every year along the 300km (185-mile) route connecting Huay Xay, Pak Beng and Luang Prabang, according to the Mekong River Commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Mr Cook, the experience was \"terrifying\" and it made him want to get out of Luang Prabang, \"although everyone's really friendly here\", because it was a constant reminder of his narrow escape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC from Vang Vieng, a town in northern Laos, Mr Cook said he planned to file for insurance claims for his electrical items that were broken and for cash that was lost, though he was not sure who would be held responsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm assuming it's just a freak accident,\" he said, though he added he \"was not sure how avoidable\" the ferry capsizing was.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not the first time such a sinking has occurred in Laos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September 2023, a passenger boat, which travelled on the same river corridor between Huay Xai and Luang Prabang, capsized in the Mekong in Pakbeng district, resulting in three deaths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boat reportedly became entangled in a fishing net, causing loss of control and the vessel overturning in strong currents.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But she has not disputed specific quotes, including her assertion that Trump has not yet solidified a lasting Republican majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The people that are inordinately interested in Epstein are the new members of the Trump coalition, the people that I think about all the time – because I want to make sure that they are not [only] Trump voters, they're Republican voters,\" she told the magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polls and experts back up the chief of staff's concerns about the tenuous nature of Trump's coalition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A survey released in early December by the right-wing Manhattan Institute think tank labelled nearly a third of Trump's supporters \"New Entrant Republicans\" – people who voted for the party for the first time in 2024. And the poll found that just over half of that category would \"definitely\" support a Republican in the 2026 mid-term elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These voters are drawn to Trump but are not reliably attached to the Republican Party,\" the institute concluded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The possible fragility of the Trump coalition is playing out on several different levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One crucial group is a collection of social media stars and podcasters who stand mostly outside traditional Republican circles but have clout and influence online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were instrumental in keeping social media attention on the Epstein story long after the convicted sex offender's death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A group of influencers – including \"Libs of TikTok\" creator Chaya Raichik, conspiracy theorist and Turning Point USA activist Jack Posobiec, and elections organiser Scott Presler – were<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>even invited to an event at the Department of Justice (DoJ) and given binders, which Bondi described as a \"first phase\" of Epstein document releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Little if anything new was in the binders, which caused a backlash. Outrage swelled further in July after the DoJ released a memo saying that there was no Epstein \"client list\" and rejecting conspiracy theories about his death in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet following the most recent release, many of these same conservative influencers have been curiously silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Laura Loomer, a popular Maga social media influencer who has helped spread Epstein conspiracies online, claimed that they exonerated Trump from any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe now the media will stop obsessing over these files,\" wrote Loomer, who has mentioned Epstein at least 200 times on X this year alone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others - including several who were at the DoJ binder event - have not mentioned the document release at all, positively or negatively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their silence has been noted by other right-wing and far-right commentators, sparking online Maga infighting. And the row over the Epstein case is just one controversy currently roiling the movement, with arguments over free speech, anti-Semitism and Charlie Kirk's legacy <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp84p722m3do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">bursting out into the open at an annual conference put on by Turning Point USA this week</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jared Holt, senior researcher at Open Measures, a company that analyses online extremism, says the debate over the Epstein files is just one controversy contributing to the challenges facing the Maga movement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the beginning of the year, Maga was a triumphant intimidating cultural force, now the train is falling off the tracks and there's no clear sign that it will be stabilising or rebounding anytime soon,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It seems like the die-hard Trump base has atrophied over the course of the year,\" Holt says, but notes that it's too soon to tell if the recent heavily redacted document drop will have any significant impact on the sorts of \"Joe Rogan listeners\" Wiles is concerned about.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7ae4/live/a202eb90-df30-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images The three members of Congress are outside in front of a stand of microphones and a sign reading \"Epstein files transparency act\"' class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Rep Thomas Massie (c) speaking prior to last month's vote on a measure to compel the DoJ to release the files, along with Ro Khanna (l) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (r)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prominent voices in Congress have been less shy than the influencer class about criticising the justice department.

Siwar Ashour, whose story the BBC has followed for several months, was repatriated to Gaza on 3 December after completing her medical treatment in Amman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She'd spent six months in hospital there under a medical evacuation programme run by the Kingdom of Jordan. Her grandmother, Sahar Ashour, said she became ill three days after coming back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She started having diarrhoea and vomiting and her situation keeps getting worse. The diarrhoea won't go away,\" she told a freelance journalist working for the BBC in Gaza. International journalists have been banned by Israel from entering Gaza independently since the start of the war nearly two years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar is being treated at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the central Gaza Strip where Dr Khalil al-Daqran told the BBC she is \"receiving the necessary treatment, but the situation is still bad for her\". The doctor said Siwar was suffering from a gastro-intestinal infection. She has an immune system deficiency which makes it hard for her to fight bacteria. She also struggles to absorb nutrition, meaning she requires specialised baby formula.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Khalil al-Daqran said poor hygiene conditions had disease to spread</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Daqran said that hospitals in Gaza - many of which were badly damaged by Israeli bombing and fighting nearby with Hamas before a ceasefire took effect in October - were seeing an increase in child admissions. Poor hygiene conditions caused by the destruction of vital infrastructure have led to the spread of infections and disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Since the ceasefire was announced, the number of child patients arriving at Gaza Strip hospitals is three times the capacity… The situation at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital is no different from other hospitals in the Gaza Strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It suffers from a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, and a major shortage regarding electric generators, which are the main artery to keep a hospital going.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World Health Organization (WHO) described humanitarian needs in Gaza as \"staggering, with current assistance addressing only the most basic survival requirements\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar was evacuated to Jordan in June after the BBC reported on her case and raised it directly with the Jordanian authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jordan's Minister of Communications, Dr Mohammed al-Momani, told us that Siwar was among 45 children returned to Gaza after completing their treatment. Under the evacuation scheme all patients are sent back after medical attention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I put it to Dr al-Momani that people might find it hard to accept that a child in such a vulnerable condition could be sent back to Gaza in the current conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No patient is sent back before they finish their medical treatment… the first reason [why they are returned] is that this will allow us to bring more patients from Gaza.

However her mother Najwa told us that Israeli officials confiscated much of what they'd been given -  nine of their 12 cans were taken. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They told us, 'It is forbidden to take more than these cans,'\" said Siwar's mother, Najwa Ashour. \"Even though it is therapeutic milk and they said that treatment is allowed, yet they took them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also said that extra clothing the family had been given in Jordan was taken. \"They searched us from top to bottom. When they saw us wearing clothes over each other [layered] they refused to let us out, and told us, 'You must take off all the clothes, down to one outfit.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked the Israeli government why the milk formula and clothing were confiscated? They replied that limits were placed on what could be taken back for \"security considerations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said only minimal luggage was allowed and this had been conveyed to the Jordanian authorities and the returning families. \"In cases where the luggage exceeded the approved scope, its entry was denied.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The WHO has appealed for more countries to offer medical evacuation to patients who cannot get the necessary treatment in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also called on the Israeli government to allow patients to be treated in occupied East Jerusalem and the West Bank \"which is the most time and cost effective route.\" Israel stopped allowing such evacuations after the Hamas-led 7 October attacks on Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 abducted into Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cogat, the Israeli military bosy in charge of aid, said the process for Gazan residents' departure to third countries had been substantially eased.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siwar's family has been given Neocate milk formula since returning to Gaza.

It is also among the world's most studied anti-poverty programmes, with strong equity: over half of the estimated 126 million scheme workers are women, and around 40% come from \"scheduled castes\" or tribes, among the most deprived Indians</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling Narendra Modi government, initially critical and later inclined to pare it back, turned to the scheme in crises -  most notably during the Covid pandemic, when mass return migration from cities to villages sharply drove up demand for work. Economists say the scheme lifted rural consumption, reduced poverty, improved school attendance, and in some regions pushed up private-sector wages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, the government introduced a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prsindia.org/files/bills_acts/bills_parliament/2025/Summary-Viksit_Bharat_GRamG_Bill_2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new law</a> that repeals and rebrands the scheme. The programme - renamed MGNREGA in 2009 to honour Mahatma Gandhi - has now dropped his name altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the renaming drew the political heat, the more consequential changes lie in what the new law - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/g-ram-g-bill-kya-hai-what-is-g-ram-g-bill-g-ram-g-explained-g-ram-g-full-firm-g-ram-g-protests-bill-to-replace-mnrega-9845618\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">known as G RAM G for shor</a>t - actually does.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raises the annual employment guarantee from 100 to 125 days per rural household. It retains the provision that workers not given jobs within 15 days are entitled to an unemployment allowance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the original scheme, the federal government paid all labour wages and most material costs - roughly a 90:10 split with the states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Funding will now follow a 60:40 split between the federal government and most states. That could push states' contribution to 40% or more of total project cost. The federal government keeps control, including the power to notify the scheme and decide state-wise allocations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e53/live/50081a50-db6a-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mint via Getty Images Women in bright clothes, with heads covered doing manual labour under MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Gurantee Act) in Jaipur, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mint via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Women at work under the scheme in Rajasthan; they make up over half of all workers </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">States remain legally responsible for providing employment - or paying unemployment allowances, even as the central government allocates $9.5bn for the scheme in the current financial year, ending next March.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government frames the reforms as a modernised, more effective, and corruption-free programme aimed at empowering the poor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This law stands firmly in favour of the poor, in support of progress, and in complete guarantee of employment for the workers,\" says federal agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics - including opposition parties, academics, and some state governments - warn that capping funds and shifting costs to states could dilute a rare legal right in India's welfare system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is the culmination of the long-standing drive for centralisation of the scheme under the Modi government. But it is more than centralisation. It is the reduction of employment guarantee to a discretionary scheme. A clause allows the federal government to decide where and when the scheme applies,\" Jean Dreze, a development economist, told me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Dreze says the increase to 125 guaranteed workdays per household may sound like a major revamp, but is a \"red herring\".

West Bengal's programme, for example, has faced deep cuts and funding freezes since 2022, with the federal government halting funds over alleged non-compliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet despite these challenges, the scheme appears to have delivered measurable impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An influential <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/SmartcardsGE.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">study</a> by economists Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehaus, and Sandip Sukhtankar found that the broader, economy-wide impacts of the scheme boosted beneficiary households' earnings by 14% and cut poverty by 26%. Workers demanded higher wages, land returns fell, and job gains were larger in villages, the study found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many say the scheme's durability also underscores a deeper structural problem: India's chronic inability to generate enough non-farm jobs to absorb surplus rural labour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agriculture has consistently lagged behind the broader economy, growing just 3% annually since 2001–02, compared with 7% for the rest of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics such as Nitin Pai of the Takshashila Institution, a think-tank, argue that the scheme cushions distress but does little to raise long-term rural productivity, and may even blunt incentives for agricultural reform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With [the scheme] we're merely treating a serious underlying malaise with steroids,\" said Mr Pai in a post on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's Economic Survey 2023–24 questions whether demand under the scheme truly mirrors rural hardship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If that was the case, data should show higher fund use and employment in poorer states with higher unemployment, the survey says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, it notes, Tamil Nadu, with under 1% of the country's poor, received nearly 15% of the scheme's funds, while Kerala, with just 0.1% of the poor, accounted for almost 4% of federal allocations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survey adds that the actual work generated depends largely on a state's administrative capacity: states with trained staff can process requests on time, directly influencing how much employment is provided.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd3e/live/2bcc8c80-db69-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images Women working for lake rejuvenation under MNREGA scheme at Bevanahalli village in Mandya, India.

Not only that, many refrigerants produce highly potent greenhouse gases, which threaten to exacerbate climate change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two-phase cooling systems use such refrigerants says Yulin Wang, a former senior technology analyst at IDTechEx, a market research firm. The refrigerant starts out as a liquid but heat from server components causes it to evaporate into a gas and this phase change soaks up a lot of energy, meaning it is an effective way of cooling things down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some designs, data centre tech is fully immersed in large quantities of PFAS-containing refrigerant. \"Vapours can get out of the tank,\" adds Mr Wang. \"There could be some safety issues.\" In other cases, the refrigerant is piped directly to the hottest components, computer chips, only.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some companies that offer two-phase cooling are currently switching to PFAS-free refrigerants.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f56/live/03c9ff30-d031-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Yulin Wang Yulin Wang wearing a brown hoodie smiles while sitting in a park full of pumpkins.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Yulin Wang</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Yulin Wang warns of safety issues with some cooling chemicals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, firms have experimented with wildly different approaches to cooling, in a race to find the best means of keeping data centre gadgets happy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Microsoft famously <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-54146718\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sank a tube-like container</a> full of servers into the sea off Orkney, for example. The idea was that cold Scottish seawater would improve the efficiency of air-based cooling systems inside the device.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Microsoft confirmed that it had shuttered the project. But the company had learned much from it, says Alistair Speirs, general manager of global infrastructure in the Microsoft Azure business group. \"Without [human] operators, less things went wrong – that informed some of our operational procedures,\" he says. Data centres that are more hands-off appear more reliable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial findings showed the subsea data centre had a power usage effectiveness, or PUE, rating of 1.07 – suggesting it was far more efficient than the vast majority of land-based data centres. And it required zero water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the end, Microsoft concluded that the economics of building and maintaining subsea data centres weren't very favourable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company is still working on liquid-based cooling ideas, including microfluidics, where tiny channels of liquid flow through the many layers of a silicon chip. \"You can think of a liquid cooling maze through the silicon at nanometre scale,\" says Mr Speirs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Researchers are coming up with other ideas, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, Renkun Chen, at the University of California San Diego, and colleagues, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2542435125001564\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">published a paper</a> detailing their idea for a pore-filled membrane-based cooling technology that could help to cool chips passively – without the need to actively pump fluids or blow air around.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Essentially, you are using heat to provide the pumping power,\" says Prof Chen. He compares it to the process by which water evaporates from a trees' leaves, inducing a pumping effect that draws more water up through the plant's trunk and along its branches to replenish the leaves. Prof Chen says he hopes to commercialise the technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New ways of cooling down data centre tech are increasingly sought-after, says Sasha Luccioni, AI and climate lead at Hugging Face, a machine learning company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is partly due to demand for AI – including generative AI, or large language models (LLMs), which are the systems that power chat bots. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.sashaluccioni.com/assets/AI%20+%20Environment%20Primer%20(Hugging%20Face).pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In previous research</a>, Dr Luccioni has shown that such technologies eat up lots of energy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have models that are very energy-intensive, then the cooling has to be stepped up a notch,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/26/ai-reasoning-models-problem.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Reasoning models</a>, which explain their output in multiple steps, are even more demanding, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They use \"hundreds or thousands of times more energy\" than standard chat bots that just answer questions. Dr Luccioni calls for greater transparency from AI companies regarding how much energy their various products consume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Mr Ballon, LLMs are just one form of AI – and he argues they have already \"reached their limit\" in terms of productivity.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More Technology of Business</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

While both sides have much in common, there is one major difference - abortion is illegal in Tennessee. This has been the case since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling which gave individual states, rather than the federal government, the power to legislate abortion, triggering 12 states to pass near-total bans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the city's only abortion clinic, Bristol Women's Health, moved less than a mile down the road to continue practising legally in Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But just because abortion is legal in Virginia it doesn't mean the battle for abortion access is over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like whack-a-mole,\" said Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership. They assist people travelling into Virginia to get an abortion at Bristol Women's Health Clinic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As soon as one approach doesn't work, the anti-abortion crowd pops up in Bristol and tries another.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Barbara Schwartz (on right) with other volunteers at the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 22 December, Bristol's Circuit Court will hear the clinic's case against an eviction notice served by their landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King in April 2024. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for the clinic argue it has the right to renew its lease for a total of six more years. But if the judge rules in favour of the building's owners, the clinic will be forced to find a new home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the landlords' first attempt to remove the clinic from their property. The brothers claimed that the clinic fraudulently concealed that they perform abortions, to which they maintain to be \"adamantly opposed\". The case was dismissed in September last year, with Judge Sage Johnson ruling:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If [the landlords] had conducted a simple internet search on their tenants, as any reasonably prudent landlord likely would, they would have discovered that the clinic did, in fact, provide abortion services as is plainly stated on their website.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clinic owner Diana Derzis, who declined to comment on the hearing, previously stated that she hopes to keep the clinic in the city, even if they are evicted. However, she noted there are few other suitable facilities in Bristol, Virginia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The clinic leaving Bristol would be a \"blow\" to abortion access, according to Barbara Schwartz, the co-founder of SLAAP, the State Line Abortion Access Partnership.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Roe v Wade was overturned, states where abortions are legal have become destinations for out-of-state abortion seekers, with 155,000 people crossing state lines last year, according to the Guttmacher Institute (GI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The organisation also found that over 9,200 people travelled to Virginia alone to have the procedure done last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bristol's position means the clinic is the closest place by several hours to get a safe and legal abortion for millions of southerners.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Victoria Cobb, the director of anti-abortion lobbyist the Family Foundation, also notes that Bristol's location places it at the \"epicentre of the debate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Cobb launched the first of several efforts to restrict abortion in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. The tactic is being used by anti-abortion campaigners in states which permit abortion. The logic is simple<b id=\":\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">:</b> If you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Locals don't want to see their town turn into an abortion destination location,\" Ms Cobb states. \"We're happy to help them.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sammi Cooper is opposed to abortion and protests against the clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Family Foundation has argued in the past that the existence of the clinic goes against zoning regulation, which prohibits buildings from being used in a way that could endanger life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would this not extend to unborn life?\" asked Ms Cobb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their ordinance said no new clinics should be allowed to open in Bristol, and expansion of the existing clinic should be blocked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar rules have been used in other parts of the US to restrict abortion, including nearby Washington and Russell counties. But Prof Laura Hermer, an expert on abortion regulations in the US, says these efforts are largely \"virtue signalling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'd be surprised if many of these towns have any healthcare, let alone abortion, providers,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate became heated in Bristol, as the council agreed to look into the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before,\" Jay Detrick, the city's planning director told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimately, the city's attorney found that imposing restrictions on a medical facility was not in their remit. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon after the city decided not to intervene, another group decided to try and shut the clinic down - this one spearheaded by Texas pastor Mark Lee Dickson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pastor has lobbied councils across the US to enforce the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68580015\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Comstock Act</a>, a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ninety-three local authorities have passed ordinances to enforce the Comstock Act, even closing a Planned Parenthood clinic in Lubbock, Texas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pastor Dickson is hopeful his ordinance filed in Bristol will have the same result. It has not yet been considered by the Council, but he remains optimistic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A local government's tabling or rejecting of such a measure doesn't by any means mean the initiative is dead,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kimberly Smith, SLAAP's co-founder, anticipates further campaigns. She says anti-abortion activists target Bristol due to its unusual political make-up:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They come here because we were a red part of a blue state. If they chip away here, then that weakens the entire framework of a state's rights.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, even if the clinic wins its case this week and can remain in place, its opponents are undeterred, Pastor Dickson tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as the cries of unborn babies are silenced in Bristol there will be an effort to push the City Council to fulfil their obligation to protect unborn Bristolians.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
