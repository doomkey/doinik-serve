Are we on a path to a nuclear standoff between America and Russia? An internet-age version of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I doubt it, judging by initial reaction in Russia.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russian news outlets have been rather dismissive of Trump's announcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, a military commentator concluded that Trump was \"throwing a temper tantrum\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A retired lieutenant-general told Kommersant that the US president's talk of submarines was \"meaningless blather. It's how he gets his kicks\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm sure Trump didn't really give any orders [about submarines],\" a Russian security expert suggested to the same paper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kommersant also mentions that in 2017, Trump said that he'd despatched two nuclear submarines to the Korean peninsula as a warning to North Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet not long after, Trump held a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, bizarrely, might Donald Trump's latest submarine deployment be a precursor to a US-Russia summit?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I wouldn't go that far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the reaction from the Russian authorities has been interesting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At time of writing, there hasn't been any. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not from the Kremlin. Not from the Russian foreign ministry. Nor the defence ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And I've seen no announcement about Russian nuclear submarines being positioned closer to America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Which suggests that either Moscow is still studying the situation and working out what to do, or that Moscow doesn't feel the need to react.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Russian press reaction I mentioned earlier suggests it's the latter.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump had been sparring with Medvedev on social media for several days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the US president had reduced his 50-day deadline for Russia to end its war in Ukraine to less than two weeks, Medvedev posted that Trump was \"playing the ultimatum game with Russia…Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump responded: \"Tell Medvedev, the failed former Russian president who thinks he is still in power, to be careful what he says. He is entering very dangerous territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Medvedev's next post contained a reference to \"Dead Hand\", the automatic nuclear retaliation system developed in the Soviet Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Clearly, that did not go down well with the White House chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When he was Russia's president, between 2008 and 2012, Medvedev was seen as a relatively liberal figure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Freedom is better than no freedom\" he was famously quoted as saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he has grown increasingly hawkish. Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine he has gained a reputation for bombastic, anti-Western social media posts. Most of them have passed unnoticed, since he is not viewed as the voice of the Kremlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Suddenly he has been noticed: by the President of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And not just noticed. He's got right under Trump's skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's one thing to dislike a social media post. We've all been there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But to dislike it so much you deploy nuclear submarines feels like overkill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So why has Trump done it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here's Trump's own explanation from his interview with Newsmax: \"Medvedev said some things that are very bad, talking about nuclear. When you mention the word nuclear my eyes light up and I say we better be careful, because it's the ultimate threat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Medvedev has long been accused of nuclear sabre-rattling via social media. It's nothing new.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What is clear is that Trump took the recent Medvedev posts very personally, and reacted accordingly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Might there also be a strategy at play? Unpredictability feels like a big part of Trump's way of doing things, in business and in politics; taking unexpected decisions that can put rivals and opponents off balance before talks or during a negotiation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On ending the war in Ukraine, for example.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Surprise submarine deployments may well fall into that category.</p></div></div></body></html>"

For Switzerland, this is a huge shock, and worse than the worst-case scenario – these are the highest tariffs in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Globally, the fourth highest, behind only Syria, Laos, and Myanmar, (although if President Trump follows through on his 50% tariff threat then Brazil will jump to the top of the list).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's the one story dominating the news and the airwaves on Friday. One newspaper, Blick, described it as the country's biggest defeat since French victory in the battle of Marignano in 1515.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just weeks ago, Switzerland's government was exuding confidence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, a Swiss facilitated meeting between the US and China in Geneva, aimed at preventing a trade war between the two economic superpowers, allowed Switzerland's president Karin Keller-Sutter to grab a meeting with US trade secretary Scott Bessent.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She came out smiling. She had been told, she said, that Switzerland was likely to be second on the list after the United Kingdom to strike a trade deal with Washington. 10%, she hinted, was the tempting tariff offer, far lower than the 31% Donald Trump had unveiled for Switzerland on his 'liberation day' in April.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, those illusions are shattered. Just hours before the August first deadline, one last telephone call between Ms Keller-Sutter and President Trump yielded nothing. Hours later came the news that the tariffs would not be 31% as originally threatened, but a punitive 39%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Why? Some Swiss politicians are already arguing that Switzerland's negotiating tactics were not up to scratch – but some say too tough, others say too obsequious. The reality may be more straightforward: Trump was keen to make big deals, and Switzerland just isn't that big. It's not even clear how many discussions the Swiss trade negotiators were able to have with their US counterparts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sticking point, the Swiss government says now, is the trade deficit it has with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump sees trade deficits - when a country sells more to the US than it buys - as inherently a problem for the US, although this is a view not widely shared by economists. He believes tariffs can help protect the US manufacturing sector, which for decades has lost jobs to companies overseas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Swiss trade deficit with the US was $47.4 billion in 2024, though if service industries are included, which Trump conveniently ignored, the deficit shrinks to $22 billion. Switzerland sells more (primarily in pharmaceuticals, gold jewellery, watches and machine tools) to the US than it buys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To try to compensate for that, the Swiss government reduced its own tariffs on US industrial good to zero, and multiple Swiss companies (Nestle, Novartis) promised multibillion dollar investments in US plants. Switzerland is already the world's 6th largest investor in the US, creating, the Swiss say, 400,000 US jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But balancing the deficit looks impossible. The population of Switzerland is just 9 million, and, bluntly, many of them don't want to buy US products. The gas guzzling cars are too big for alpine roads, US cheese and chocolate…well, let's just say they're not really to Swiss taste.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c571/live/3b9fbc30-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Switzerland's president Karin Keller-Sutter smiling sat at a desk with a blue background and part of a swiss flag behind her\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Switzerland's president Karin Keller-Sutter</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jan Atteslander, head of foreign trade at EconomieSuisse which represents businesses, told Swiss broadcasting: \"We need reliable relations with the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This could be a signal of frustration that one of Switzerland's most important export markets has adopted an on/off trade policy, stripping Swiss business of the certainty it needs.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So what can Switzerland do now? There is a small window of opportunity, until August 7th, when the tariffs are due to come into force. Until then, the Swiss government will feverishly try to negotiate. Swiss businesses are warning of thousands of job losses if the 39% can't be reduced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it's hard to see what the wiggle room is. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With the investment promises, and the zero tariffs, Switzerland had already offered everything it could. The only tactic now would be punitive - withdraw the investment offer, introduce reciprocal tariffs, and, the nuclear option, cancel Switzerland's order for US F35 fighter planes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Across Switzerland, there is confusion - and anger. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Friday is Swiss national day, the equivalent of July 4th. After giving her traditional speech, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter was asked about the US tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She told reporters the talks with the US went well but that for Donald Trump, the trade deficit was the obstacle. The inference was that the US president was the problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead of the usual patriotic celebrations, many Swiss feel they are being punished for having one of the world's most competitive and innovative countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Others say the country has survived economic shocks before, and will be able to use that innovation to survive this one.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was the largest downward revision in employment figures - apart from the Covid-era - since 1979. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not unusual for the BLS to amend jobs figures as more data comes to light, however. During Joe Biden's presidency, statistics for 12 months over 2023-4 were retroactively revised downward by 818,000 jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Though this month's changes were much larger than usual, analysts said the updates were consistent with other data showing slowdown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president posted on Truth Social on Friday: \"The Economy is BOOMING under 'TRUMP.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Heather Long, chief economist at the Navy Federal Credit Union, said the job figures were a \"gamechanger\", adding that \"the labor market is deteriorating quickly\" because of uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president has dismissed concerns about his tariff plans, which he says will boost manufacturing in the US and rebalance global trade. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But data this week and a string of updates from companies on tariff costs have made those forecasts harder to ignore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the decision to sack McEntarfer, former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said: \"Firing the head of a key government agency because you don't like the numbers they report, which come from surveys using long established procedures, is what happens in authoritarian countries, not democratic ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Friends of BLS, a group whose members include two former commissioners of the agency, said: \"When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">McEntarfer called her time as commissioner \"the honour of my life\", while describing the agency's work as \"vital and important\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Leading US stock market indices all closed sharply lower on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has attacked key economic figures in the past, most recently Jerome Powell, chair of the US Federal Reserve, as the central bank continues to leave interest rates unchanged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump is demanding a cut, but the Fed is holding fire until it sees the full impact of tariffs on the US economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the aftermath of the jobs report, Trump launched a further salvo at Powell, stating he should also be put \"out to pasture\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A member of the Fed's rate-setting committee, Adriana Kugler, is resigning early giving Trump an opportunity to install someone new. Her term was due to end next January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The head of the Labour Department, which oversees the BLS, wrote on social media that the agency's deputy commissioner William Wiatrowski would step into the role during the search for a replacement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Labour Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts speculated that the jobs data could reflect a hit to small businesses, which are typically slower to respond to surveys and are especially vulnerable to tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">McEntarfer worked for the government for more than 20 years before being nominated by Biden to lead the BLS in 2023. She was later confirmed near unanimously by the US Senate, including by current Vice-President JD Vance, who was then an Ohio senator. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, defended Entarfer, saying she had conducted herself with \"great integrity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is imperative that decisionmakers understand that government statistics are unbiased and of the highest quality. By casting doubt on that, the President is damaging the United States,\" he wrote on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the firing raised serious alarm. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For six months, I've said that threats to economic data have been more collateral damage than intentional harm. No longer. Firing the head of the BLS is five-alarm intentional harm to the integrity of US economic data and the entire statistical system,\" he wrote on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump defended the decision and said her departure was needed to ensure there were \"people that we can trust\" in these posts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Why should anybody trust numbers?\" the president told reporters when leaving the White House on Friday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I believe the numbers were phony, just like they were before the election, and there were other times - so you know what I did? I fired her, and you know what I did?

In recent weeks, indexes in the US have been trading around all-time highs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest measures are less extreme than what Trump first put forward in April, but they will still push the average tariff rate to roughly 17%, up from less than 2.5% at the start of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The reality is Trump got emboldened by the fact that markets came right back,\" Michael Gayed, a portfolio manager for The Free Markets ETF, told the BBC's Opening Bell. \"Now he's going to try his luck again.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The two sides, however, agreed to swap several thousands of prisoners of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking shortly after Putin's comments, Zelensky questioned whether Russia was showing \"serious readiness to end the war with dignity and establish a truly lasting peace\" or whether it was \"just an attempt to buy more time for war and postpone sanctions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent weeks, Russia has intensified its deadly drone and missile strikes on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Thursday, at least 31 people - including five children - were killed in a Russian aerial assault on the Ukrainian capital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions, threatening new sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Russia, I think it's disgusting what they're doing,\" he told journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When in July Trump announced his original 50-day deadline for Russia to end the war, Putin didn't react. When that was reduced to 10-12 days, Putin said nothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on Friday the Kremlin leader left little doubt that he would not be swayed by a White House ultimatum. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump may claim to be \"disappointed\" with Putin for not making peace - but the Russian leader is unrepentant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His guest on the Valaam island, Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, was more direct in his dismissal of Trump's deadline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"50 days, 60 days, 10 days. You don't do politics like that,\" Lukashenko said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Experience shows that, for Trump, deadlines are not set in stone. But on paper, at least, his latest deadline expires on 8 August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If by then Russia hasn't signed up to a ceasefire in Ukraine, it will face more sanctions – so in theory will countries that buy Russian oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But judging by what the Russian state media has been saying in recent days, many in Moscow doubt the White House will go through with its threat of tougher sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What's more, from what Putin said on Friday about Russia advancing along the entire front line in Ukraine,  he clearly believes a ceasefire now is not in Moscow's best interest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainian officials on Friday said Kyiv had received \"positive signals\" from the US about potential new sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A day earlier, senior US diplomat John Kelley told the UN Security Council that Russia and Ukraine \"must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is time to make a deal,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, who is currently in Israel, would visit Russia next, the US president said earlier this week. He gave no further details.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It houses inmates serving time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also housed among the approximately 650 female inmates at the facility <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65625526\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">is disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes</a>, who is serving an 11-year prison sentence after being found guilty of defrauding investors in her blood-testing start-up in 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By comparison, the facility where Maxwell was housed in Florida, FCI Tallahassee, houses over 800 inmates, both men and women. Both facilities are officially deemed to be \"low-security\" federal prisons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While discipline is strict at the facility and all prisoners are expected to work, they also have access to foreign language and business classes, can play sports, watch television and attend religious services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Contact with family members is allowed to video calls, and inmates are permitted visitors during weekends and holidays, according to a prison handbook published by authorities online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Less than a week ago, Maxwell's legal team indicated that she was willing to testify before Congress on what she knows about the case, but only if she is granted strict legal protections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However on Friday, the scheduled 11 August deposition was indefinitely postponed, the chair of the House Oversight Committee announced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rep James Comer said while the committee was \"willing to continue to engage in good faith negotiations\", it would not grant her congressional immunity or provide questions in advance, two conditions Maxwell's lawyers had requested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier in July, she held two meetings with Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said he planned to see if she could provide additional information on other people who might have been helped by Epstein to sexually abuse girls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the meetings, he said that he would reveal what he learned at an \"appropriate time\". Maxwell's lawyer has said that she has not made promises or sought anything in exchange. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pressure has been growing on President Trump to release more files related to the Epstein case, after he repeatedly promised to do so while on the campaign trail last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has instead accused political rivals of using the case to distract from his achievements since returning to office. </p></div></div></body></html>"

That marks a more than 50% rise compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">K-beauty products are often more attractively priced than their Western counterparts - but also feature ingredients that are not as commonly found in the West - from heartleaf to snail mucin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US President Donald Trump has now imposed a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpvl9krxwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">15% import tax on South Korean goods</a> traded between Seoul and Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's less than the 25% levy that Trump had threatened, but many consumers are not taking any chances. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US K-beauty retailer Santé Brand saw orders spike by nearly 30% in April, right after Trump unveiled sweeping US import taxes on most of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the tariff announcements hit, customers got strategic with how they were going to weather the storm,\" Santé Brand's founder Cheyenne Ware told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Consumers are preparing against the uncertainty.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another K-beauty retailer, Senti Senti, has been ordering more products since Trump started his tariff threats, says manager Winnie Zhong. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This week, she received alerts from suppliers urging retailers to \"stock up before tariffs\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both retailers said prices of K-beauty products are likely to increase as the levies push up costs across the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Anyone telling you prices will stay flat through the next two years is naive,\" says Ms Ware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prices are bound to rise, especially for smaller sellers of beauty products on platforms like Amazon, who operate with slim profit margins, economist Munseob Lee from the University of California San Diego says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite higher prices, the global popularity of South Korean culture means K-beauty products are likely to remain in demand in the US, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Casual buyers might be turned off by the higher price, but fans won't find an easy substitute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Zhong agrees.

Inside, there was a four-rotor drone he intended to fly around the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He pressed buttons on the control unit and pushed the antenna to different positions. Nothing happened. \"Sorry, not today,\" he said, with a smile. The unit looked fine, but something was broken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the front, Pavlo, who asked to be identified only by his first name, was a pilot of first-person view (FPV) drones. These small, highly manoeuvrable drones have front-facing cameras that allow them to be flown remotely. Over the past year or so, bomb-laden FPVs have become ubiquitous on the front lines in Ukraine, replacing the heavy weapons that characterised the war's first phase.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The FPVs chase armoured vehicles, hunt infantry units through treelines and stalk individual soldiers to their deaths. \"You cannot hide from the FPV, and to run is useless,\" Pavlo said. \"You try to be as calm as possible, and you pray.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even when an FPV is too high to see clearly, or hidden behind foliage, soldiers can hear its distinctive, high-pitched whine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bzzzzzzzzzz,\" Pavlo said. \"You are being hunted.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6e54/live/2b284610-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An arm holds on to a silver-coloured drone perched on the ground in the dark\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Small FPV drones with munitions attached, in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After more than a year at the front, Pavlo has returned home to the Kyiv apartment he shares with his wife. But the sound of the drones has followed him. Everyday mechanical tools like lawnmowers, motorcycles and air conditioners remind him of the FPVs that hunted him and his unit mates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And nature is not an escape. Pavlo can no longer hear the sound of bees and flies buzzing near him without a creeping panic. \"I don't like to go into nature anymore and hear this sound, because it reminds me so hard of the drones,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trauma associated with sound is not new – generations of soldiers have been affected by sudden noises after returning to civilian life. But as the war in Ukraine has evolved into a conflict driven by drone technology, the trauma has evolved with it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Over the past year, the majority of patients – if they are not physically wounded – have mental health injuries as a result of being under drone activity,\" said Dr Serhii Andriichenko, chief psychiatrist at Kyiv's military hospital. \"We call this droneophobia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many thousands of men are now returning from the front like Pavlo, with acute stress disorders associated with the sounds of drones, Dr Andriichenko said. The droneophobia can be triggered by an array of ordinary urban sounds – small motorcycles and scooters, lawnmowers, air conditioners – anything mechanical that whirrs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If it's a moped or a lawnmower, my first thought is that it might be a drone,\" said another returned frontline soldier, Savur, who lost his arm in an FPV drone attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the front line the drones were a \"permanent sound\", said Savur, who in accordance with military protocol asked to be identified by his callsign. \"The sound of a shell lasts just a few seconds, but the sound of the drone is there most of the time,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can lay in your position, in your foxhole, and listen to it for hours. I remember that sound all of the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Or sometimes the problem was the opposite – silence. \"Silence is always the start,\" Dr Andriichenko, the psychiatrist, said. \"When the soldiers go on rotation to combat positions, they start listening carefully to make sure there are no drones. There is constant tension, constant fear. They are always looking up.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Serhii Andriichenko, chief psychiatrist at Kyiv's military hospital. \"We call this droneophobia,\" he said.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In many cases, that constant sense of tension has not been dispelled by the return to civilian life. Soldiers have been observed suddenly switching off lights at home, moving away from windows and hiding under furniture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later, if a soldier is seen for treatment, Dr Andriichenko describes how he often has no memory of any trigger sound, but his wife or family member will reveal that an extractor fan or air conditioner had just been turned on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soldiers from the earlier phases of the war - which was characterised more by brutal, direct combat - came home fearful of being in forests, where much of the fighting had taken place. But drone warfare has reversed the phenomenon. Now soldiers \"feel safest in forests, under dense tree canopies\", the psychiatrist said. \"And in their free time, they try to avoid wooded areas.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rise in drone use has had another terrorising effect for combat troops - it has extended the danger zone far back from the front line. Soldiers operating up to 40km (25 miles) away, or pulling back after a heavy rotation, can no longer let their guard down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nazar Bokhii, a commander of a small drone unit, was about 5km from the contact line in a dugout one day when his unit scored a direct hit on a Russian mortar position 22km away. Buoyed by the success, Bokhii bounded out of the dugout, forgetting the usual protocol of stopping first to listen for a telltale buzz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Metres away, a Russian FPV was loitering in the air. As it sped towards him, Bokhii only had time to raise his arms. When it detonated, it took both his hands and his left eye and badly burned his face.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Nazar Bokhii lost both his hands and one eye in a Russian FPV drone attack</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bokhii's own PTSD was limited, he said, to an occasional fear response to motorcycles and lawnmowers. But he knew about the effect of the sound, he said, because his unit had used it to inflict terror on others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were the side that caused fear with sound, not the side that suffered from it,\" Bokhii said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They had realised at some point that the sound could be used to force Russian soldiers into exposed areas. \"You buzz around them and it becomes a test of the enemy's psychological resilience,\" Bokhii said. \"The sound of the drone itself is a serious psychological attack.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Bokhii, buzz above a soldier for long enough and he will leave a strong shelter and simply run into open terrain. \"Our psychology works in such a way that we need to do something to calm ourselves,\" Bokhii said. \"So you hover nearby and psychologically suppress him… and he starts running and becomes easier to hit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And the psychological terror of the FPV is no longer just a problem on the front line. It has reached beyond even the areas behind the front lines. Russia has begun using FPVs to drop munitions on civilians in Ukrainian cities nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Among the worst hit is Kherson, a southern city occupied for a time by Russian forces and still comfortably within drone range. According to Human Rights Watch, Russian forces have deliberately targeted civilians in the city with FPV drones and killed or maimed them - a war crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the regional military administration, at least 84 civilians have been killed in the Kherson region as a result of Russian drone attacks so far this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Residents say the tiny FPVs are a daily terror.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no such thing as a safe place anymore,\" said Dmytro Olifirenko, a 23-year-old border guard who lives in Kherson city. \"You always have to be alert, focused, and because of that, the body is constantly under stress,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e80f/live/7f282e10-6711-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Stanislav Ostrous/BBC Dmytro Olifirenko wears a dark T-shirt with a scrawled logo in white and a tattoo partially showing on one arm\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Stanislav Ostrous/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Dmytro Olifirenko is among the many civilians wounded in drone attacks in Kherson. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Olifirenko was waiting at a bus stop in September when he heard the familiar sound of a Russian drone overhead. \"We thought it would follow the bus, because they had been hunting civilian buses,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, the drone simply dropped its munition on the bus stop, sending shrapnel into Olifirenko's head, face and leg. Video of the incident, filmed by a bystander, captured the buzz of the drone followed by Olifirenko's screams as he bled onto the pavement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Olifirenko now heard the drones \"constantly\", he said, whether they were there or not. \"It hits your mental and psychological health hard,\" he said. \"Even when you leave for Mykolaiv or another city, you are constantly trying to listen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For civilians like Oliferenko, the drones have transformed the ordinary sounds of a populated area – cars, motorcycles, generators, lawnmowers, air conditioners – into a psychological gauntlet for civilians to run every day, even as they contend with the real danger of the drones themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the soldiers coming back from the front, like Pavlo, the drones have created a new and specific type of fear, one that is not easy to shake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You see the world as a battlefield,\" Pavlo said. \"It can become a battlefield any second.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And of all the triggers, hearing - the human sense drones are exploiting so effectively - was the most insidious, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When you see something, your brain can check it in a second, you can realise what it is very fast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But an unknown sound is different.

It was part of a vast undercover scheme to raise funds for North Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Juggling multiple jobs across the US and Europe would make him at least $5,000 (£3,750) a month, he told the BBC in a rare interview. Some colleagues, he said, would earn much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before he defected, Jin-su - whose name has been changed to protect his identity - was one of thousands believed to have been sent abroad to China and Russia, or countries in Africa and elsewhere, to take part in the shadowy operation run by secretive North Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">North Korean IT workers are closely monitored and few have spoken to the media, but Jin-su has provided extensive testimony to the BBC, giving a revealing insight into what daily life is like for those working the scam, and how they operate.

Cash-strapped North Korea has been under international sanctions for years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We know it's like robbery, but we just accept it as our fate,\" Jin-su said, \"it's still much better than when we were in North Korea.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Secret IT workers generate $250m-$600m annually for North Korea, according to a UN Security Council report published in March 2024. The scheme boomed in the pandemic, when remote working became commonplace, and has been on the rise ever since, authorities and cyber defenders warn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most workers are after a steady paycheck to send back to the regime, but in some cases, they have stolen data or hacked their employers and demanded ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpdnz3elwzvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">a US court indicted 14 North Koreans</a> who allegedly earned $88m by working in disguise and extorting US firms over a six-year period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Four more North Koreans who allegedly used fraudulent identities to secure remote IT work for a cryptocurrency firm in the US were indicted last month.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Getting the jobs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su was an IT worker for the regime in China for several years before defecting. He and his colleagues would mostly work in teams of 10, he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Access to the internet is limited in North Korea, but abroad, these IT workers can operate more easily. They need to disguise their nationality not just because they can get paid more by impersonating Westerners, but due to the extensive international sanctions North Korea is under, primarily in response to its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This scheme is separate from North Korea's hacking operations which also raise money for the regime. Earlier this year the Lazarus Group - an infamous hacking group understood to be working for North Korea, though they've never admitted to it - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c2kgndwwd7lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">is thought to have stolen $1.5bn (£1.1bn) from cryptocurrency firm Bybit</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The BBC spoke to Jin-su on a video call from London. For his safety we are protecting his identity.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su spent most of his time trying to secure fraudulent identities which he could use to apply for jobs. He would first pose as Chinese, and contact people in Hungary, Turkey and other countries to ask them to use their identity in exchange for a percentage of his earnings, he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you put an 'Asian face' on that profile, you'll never get a job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He would then use those borrowed identities to approach people in Western Europe for their identities, which he'd use to apply for jobs in the US and Europe. Jin-su often found success targeting UK citizens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"With a little bit of chat, people in the UK passed on their identities so easily,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">IT workers who speak better English sometimes handle the applications process. But jobs on freelancer sites also don't necessarily require face-to-face interviews, and often day-to-day interactions take place on platforms like Slack, making it easier to pretend to be someone you are not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su told the BBC he mostly targeted the US market, \"because the salaries are higher in American companies\". He claimed so many IT workers were finding jobs, often companies would unwittingly hire more than one North Korean. \"It happens a lot,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's understood that IT workers collect their earnings through networks of facilitators based in the West and China. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2l2yn5zmxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Last week a US woman was sentenced to more than eight years in prison</a> for crimes connected to assisting North Korean IT workers find jobs and sending them money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC cannot independently verify the specifics of Jin-su's testimony, but through <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pscore.org/life-north-korea/free-resources/?ckattempt=1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">PSCORE</a>, an organisation which advocates for North Korean human rights, we've read testimony from another IT worker who defected that supports Jin-su's claims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC also spoke to a different defector, Hyun-Seung Lee, who met North Koreans working in IT while he was travelling as a businessman for the regime in China. He confirmed they'd had similar experiences.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A growing problem</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC spoke to multiple hiring managers in the cyber security and software development sector who say they've spotted dozens of candidates they suspect are North Korean IT workers during their hiring processes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rob Henley, co-founder of Ally Security in the US, was recently hiring for a series of remote vacancies at his firm, and believes he interviewed up to 30 North Korean IT workers in the process. \"Initially it was like a game to some extent, like trying to figure out who was real and who was fake, but it got pretty annoying pretty quickly,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Eventually, he resorted to asking candidates on video calls to show him it was daytime where they were. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were only hiring candidates from the US for these positions. It should have been at least light outside. But I never saw daylight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in March, Dawid Moczadło, co-founder of Vidoc Security Lab based in Poland, shared a video of a remote job interview he conducted where the candidate appeared to be using artificial intelligence software to disguise their face. He said that after speaking to experts, he believed the candidate could be a North Korean IT worker.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Get Real Security - a digital forensics company - told us it's highly likely the candidate (left) is using some kind of faceswapping or AI filter</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We contacted the North Korean embassy in London to put the allegations in this story to them. They did not respond.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A rare escape route</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">North Korea has been sending its workers abroad for decades to earn the state foreign currency. Up to 100,000 are employed abroad as factory or restaurant workers, mostly in China and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After several years of living in China, Jin-su said the \"sense of confinement\" over his oppressive working conditions built up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We weren't allowed to go out and had to stay indoors all the time\" he said. \"You can't exercise, you can't do what you want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, North Korean IT workers have more freedom to access Western media when they're abroad, Jin-su said. \"You see the real world. When we are abroad, we realise that something is wrong inside North Korea.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But despite this, Jin-su claimed few North Korean IT workers thought about escaping like he did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They just take the money and go back home, very few people would think about defection.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although they only keep a small proportion of what they earn, it's worth a lot in North Korea. Defecting is also hugely risky and difficult. Surveillance in China means most are caught. Those few who do succeed in defecting may never see their families again, and their relatives could face punishment for them leaving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jin-su is still working in IT now he's defected. He says the skills he honed working for the regime have helped him settle into his new life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Because he isn't working multiple jobs with fake IDs, he earns less than when he worked for the North Korean regime. But because he can keep more of his earnings, overall, he has more money in his own pocket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I had got used to making money by doing illegal things. But now I work hard and earn the money I deserve.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Israel's checkpoints can make driving back to Jerusalem slow and difficult, so I reached Husam Zomlot via Zoom. He is the head of the Palestinian delegation to the United Kingdom, effectively their ambassador in London. He is back home for the summer and was delighted by Britain's plan to recognise Palestine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is a sign that the UK and with it, the rest of the international community are really serious about the two-state solution.

It was, he said, a first step, and Britain's decision would make a real difference.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">History is one of the powerful drivers of this conflict. Britain, he added, was atoning at last for the wrongs it had done Palestinians when it was the imperial power here between 1917 and 1948.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02ea/live/dea7e150-6edc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Keir Starmer delivers a statement inside No 10 Downing Street, standing at a lectern in front of two flags\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was referring to the promises made in a short, typewritten letter, dated 2 November 1917, signed by the foreign secretary Arthur Balfour and addressed to Lord Rothschild, a leader of Britain's Jewish community. It was, the letter said, \"a declaration of sympathy with Jewish Zionist aspirations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain would \"view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was followed by another promise: \"Nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He meant the majority, Palestinian Arabs, though he didn't name them, a point that, 108 years later, still rankles Zomlot</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the UN in New York this week, Britain's foreign secretary David Lammy said the UK could be proud to have helped lay Israel's foundations after 1917. But breaking the promise to Palestinians in the Balfour Declaration had, he said, caused \"a historical injustice which continues to unfold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Simcha Rothman, an ultra-nationalist MP from the National Religious party also had Britain's imperial past in the Middle East on his mind. The British and French had tried to fix borders before, he said, when they took the Middle East from the dying Ottoman Empire during the First World War. Britain couldn't play the imperial power anymore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like Benjamin Netanyahu and Bezalel Smotrich, his party leader, Rothman said the plan to recognise Palestine rewarded Hamas terrorism. He rejected Starmer's offer to postpone recognition if Israel, among other conditions, agreed to a full ceasefire in Gaza and a revival of the two-state solution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He is threatening the state of Israel with punishment and thinks that's the way to bring peace to the Middle East. He is not in a position to punish us, and it definitely will not bring peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"And it's against justice, history, religion, culture... he's giving a huge reward for Yahya Sinwar [the Hamas leader who led the 7 October attacks and was killed by Israeli forces in Gaza last year].</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Wherever he is in hell today, he sees what Keir Starmer says - and says, 'good partner'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in Taybeh, I had asked a group of leading local citizens who were drinking coffee with the mayor in his office what they thought of the UK's recognition plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of them, a local businessman, said: \"Thank you Britain.

The following month, the airport set up a task force to crack down on kite-flying near its premises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five years on, the problem has persisted. In July, transport minister Dudy Purwagandhi urged airport authorities and regional governments across Indonesia to minimise the harm that kites are posing to flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's certainly a fun activity, but we also need to educate them to prevent the public or children from engaging in activities that could endanger flights,\" says Mr Putu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His colleagues have tried giving the kids footballs and badminton racquets to steer them towards other sports. But kite-flying is woven into the fabric of Indonesian culture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Traditionally made with leaves, colourful paper or cloth, kites are flown in Indonesia for various purposes: for rice harvest ceremonies, to chase birds away from crops or, in Bali, as a form of prayer and offering to the gods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Kite flying has been passed down through generations from our ancestors. Almost every region in Indonesia has a tradition of kite flying,\" says Asep Irawan, an expert from the Indonesia Kite Museum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"However, we need to be cautious, especially [with] children.

In densely populated areas, kites are also a deadly distraction. Last year, an eight-year-old boy died after venturing onto a toll road in Depok city, south of Jakarta. Police believe he was hit by a car while chasing a kite.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2020, a man was arrested after his kite broke and fell onto a substation in Bali, causing hours of blackout in more than 70,000 houses and buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back on the paddy field near Soekarno-Hatta Airport, the children say they don't mean to mess with the planes - but they are hard-pressed to find better places for their hobby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jakarta lost 31% of its urban green spaces between 2000 and 2020, as fields and forests gave way to congested roads and apartment blocks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's nowhere else around here,\" says Rasha, a 17-year-old who makes and sells kites. \"There's one other spot, but it's still close to the airport. There just aren't any other places to fly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The paddy field is now home to a community of kite enthusiasts, who organise regular kite-flying competitions. Rasha has won them twice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has got into trouble before with the patrolling airport officials, who chided him and confiscated his kites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The police even came to our house and took two of my kites and burned them, strings and all. After that, my siblings scolded me and told me to stop. But recently, I started flying kites again,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is pretty dangerous.

So what happens next for these two deeply entwined neighbours?</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canada and the US have been locked in a tariff war for six months and, despite talk of \"intense\" negotiations in recent weeks, a trade agreement remains elusive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Mark Carney have poured cold water on the idea they will reach a quick, and tariff-free,  deal. And Trump's open criticism of Canada's move to recognise a Palestinian state dashed hopes for a last minute agreement earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pessimism marks a shift in tone from as recently as June's G7 meeting, when the two leaders set themselves the summer deadline. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canadian negotiators have come to the conclusion that \"it's not the end of the world\" if a quick deal isn't reached and \"that quality over speed and a rushed agreement matters a lot\", said Fen Hampson, a professor of international affairs at Carleton University in Ottawa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Carney - who has been tight-lipped about the negotiation details - has said as much himself, repeating that just \"any deal\" won't do. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Still, there are pressures on both sides to give businesses a reprieve. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said on Friday he shares \"Canadians' disappointment\" that a deal  was not reached by the deadline. He urged Carney's Liberals to do more to \"take back control of our economic future\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canada is now facing a 35% tariff rate, though there is a carve out for goods compliant under a current free trade deal. American global tariffs on steel, aluminium, autos and auto parts are hurting, as the US is a top market for those sectors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Trump administration has justified those tariffs by claiming a lack of co-operation on stemming the flow of illicit drugs like fentanyl. Canada denies that, noting about 1% of US fentanyl imports originate in Canada. It has also brought in new border protections and a \"fentanyl czar\" in recent months in an effort to address Trump's concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Threatened tariffs on copper and the expected <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c939q47xlleo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">end of a global tariff exemption used by shoppers of goods under $800 </a>could also pinch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canada has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/international-trade-finance-policy/canadas-response-us-tariffs.html#s1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">responded with C$60bn</a> ($43.3bn; £32.3bn) in counter tariffs on various American goods -<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.trade.gov/feature-article/foreign-retaliations-timeline\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"> the only country along with China</a> to directly retaliate against Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It comes as no surprise that businesses are craving certainty after months and months of tumultuous announcements,\" said Catherine Fortin-Lefaivre, vice-president of international policy and global partnership at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But at the same time, they're not craving certainty at the expense of a really bad deal.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few factors give Canada some breathing room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On paper, it looks like the country is facing a severe tariff rate from the US, but trade is currently more free than the levies suggest at first glance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March, Trump announced a tariffs reprieve on goods compliant with the Canada–United States–Mexico Agreement, known in Canada as CUSMA and the US as the USMCA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That deal - negotiated during Trump's first term in office - came into force five years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Almost 90% of Canadian exports to the US are ultimately able to cross the border duty free, if  firms file out necessary paperwork, under that agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That has given us a buffer, no question about it, that other countries don't have right now,\" said Prof Hampson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It means Canada is overall paying a much lower tariff rate than many of the deals already inked with the US, like the EU, South Korea and Japan at 15%, or Indonesia and the Philippines at 19%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ottawa has also brought in some relief programmes for affected industries and has also collected about C$1.5bn more in import duties than in the same period last year, due to the counter tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while in the US consumer confidence is up and prices there have remained contained, it helps Canada's negotiating position if they can wait for Americans to start feeling the pain of tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's Americans who are going to squawk,\" said Prof Hampson. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Fortin-Lefaivre predicts US businesses, especially smaller firms that don't have the same resources to withstand them, will be pressuring political leaders. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So that pressure could play to our advantage,\" she said.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canadians also appear willing to give the new prime minister some leeway. Opinion polls suggest they are generally satisfied with his handling of trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Carney \"understands that doing what's best for the economy right now is actually what's best for him politically\", Martha Hall Findlay, director of the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and a former Liberal MP, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has said he is imposing tariffs to boost domestic manufacturing, open overseas markets and raise money for the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is also using them to push countries like Canada on a range of non-trade issues, including military spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the last few weeks, Ottawa has significantly ramped up its defence spending, boosted security at the shared border and killed a digital tax opposed by American tech firms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those moves show Canada is \"doing what the Americans wanted us to do\", said Ms Fortin-Lefaivre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She hopes Canadian negotiators are pushing for tariffs to be as low as possible, as well as working to ensure the two deeply integrated supply chains are able to continue working together. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canada is pressing for relief on the 50% steel and aluminium tariffs, which<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn47v5gj1nvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"> are squeezing US automakers</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent signalled in an interview with CNBC that is an option on the table. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: Why Mexico got a tariff reprieve... and Canada didn't</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump meanwhile, has raised a number of longstanding trade irritants besides fentanyl, including Canada's protections around its dairy industry.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ottawa has previously warned of more countermeasures to come if talks collapse, though political appetite for that may be waning. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Retaliatory tariffs \"haven't seemed to have had the kind of impact that we would hope for\", British Columbia Premier David Eby recently told Bloomberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On retaliation, Prof Hampson said: \"The Americans have escalation dominance here. So you want to be smart about it.\" </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A spokesperson for Carney declined to say whether more countermeasures remained on the table. Meanwhile, Canadian negotiators have been in Washington most of this week and keep pushing talks forward, with the minister responsible for Canada-US <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/reaction-trump-tariffs-canada-deadline-1.7599650\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">trade saying on Friday </a>an acceptable agreement \"was not yet in sight\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We all crave the certainty of a deal,\" said Ms Fortin-Lefaivre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But research by her business group suggests firms are making contingency plans. Almost 40% of goods exporters have already diversified suppliers outside the US, and 28% have diversified buyers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are also looking ahead to what may be more challenging talks with CUSMA, which has proven a critical backstop, as it is up for review next year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is all part of a wider push by the country to diversify trade away from the US, pull down barriers that have hindered trade between provinces, and press forward more quickly on major projects.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The economic links between the two countries will stay strong - Canada will still be one of the largest trading partners and economic and security allies of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the irony is that Trump's threats may be \"forcing Canada to understand we have to get our own economic house in order,\" said Ms Hall Findlay. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's going to take some really tough decisions. And I do think our current government gets this.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Vietnam is by far the most exposed economy, its exports to the US totalling $137bn, making up about 30% of its GDP. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No surprise then that the Vietnamese government was first off the block to negotiate with the US, and the first in the region to do a deal to cut the punishing 46% rate Trump had imposed on them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the US president, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gd66q0q7go\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the deal cuts the tariffs to 20%, </a>while he claims Vietnam will now impose no tariffs at all on any imports from the US. Tellingly, the Vietnamese leadership has said nothing about the deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are no details, no written or signed documents, and some reports suggest Vietnam does not agree with Trump's numbers. But they set the bar for other countries in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Indonesia and the Philippines followed with deals reducing their tariffs to 19%, although neither country depends much on exports to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand does export a lot to the US. Last year they earned it more than $63bn, about one-fifth of its total exports. Thailand too should have been at the head of the queue in Washington, pleading for a reduction in the 36% tariff Trump had designated for it. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aff9/live/67ef7df0-6e6b-11f0-81ca-8595fdd760a2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Thailand's acting Prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai surroundeed by mics as reporters as ask him questions.

Thailand also has a weak and fractious coalition government, beholden to a range of vested interests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Worse still, decisions it took which were entirely unrelated to trade angered the US side. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February it sent 40 Uyghur asylum-seekers who had been stuck in Thailand for more than a decade back to China, defying warnings by the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. One Thai trade official told the BBC the US negotiators were still bringing up the Uyghurs as a grievance at tariff talks in May. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then a regional army commander filed a lèse-majesté complaint against a US academic, resulting in him being jailed and then forced to leave Thailand. So, far from being at the front, Thailand found itself at the back of the queue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The other difficulty facing the Thai trade team was what the US was asking for in return for cutting the tariff rate, in particular access to Thailand's agricultural market, which is heavily protected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Food is big business in Thailand. CP Group, one of the world's agribusiness giants, is the biggest company in the country. This US demand was painful for Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Vietnam opened a Pandora's box,\" says another Thai trade official. \"By offering zero percent tariffs on all US imports, they make it hard for those of us who can't easily open up all sectors to US competition.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ebe/live/909b9270-6e02-11f0-aeff-9d04adb9c80e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Lulu Luo Two pigs with their snouts touching as they look up at the camera.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/ Lulu Luo</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Zero tariffs on US pork imports would be a blow for Thailand's pig farms </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three hours' drive from Bangkok, in Nakhon Nayok, Worawut Siripun keeps 12,000 pigs – an important business in Thailand; Thais eat a lot of pork.

The company makes the basic components that go into everything in our digital lives: printed circuit boards, integrated circuits, RFID tags for pricing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Han says only about 12% of his products go to the US directly, but like SK Polymer the proportion that goes indirectly, as part of other manufactured goods, is much higher. But it is not just the tariff number that worries him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His concern is trans-shipment, the US charge that China is avoiding tariffs by routing its production through South East Asia. Already Vietnam, according to President Trump, will pay 40% - double the new tariff rate - on goods the US judges to be trans-shipped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both Thailand and Vietnam saw foreign investment increase significantly after tariffs were imposed on China in the first Trump term, and their exports to the US rose as well. Some of that was Chinese companies moving production; some was products using a lot more Chinese-made components. And they are not just from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another electronics manufacturer, SVI, robots glided up and down the assembly line bringing hundreds of tiny components to assemble circuit boards in machines that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. A quick look at the labels showed the components came from Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and China. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">SVI makes security cameras, bespoke amplifiers, medical equipment, to whatever specification their customers, who are mainly in Scandinavia, want. Thailand's vital manufacturing sector is part of an immensely complex global supply chain which is almost impossible to rearrange to meet the US president's demands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under WTO rules a product is considered local if at least 40% of its value is added in the local manufacturing process, or if it has been \"substantially transformed\" into a new product, the way an iPhone becomes something different once it has been assembled. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d19/live/aba6e410-6e6c-11f0-b84e-f72bee782ae6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Lulu Luo A worker in overalls at an electronics factory between rows of machines\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/ Lulu Luo</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Electronics manufacturer SVI is one of many Thai companies that sits at the heart of a complex global supply chain </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Trump administration pays no heed to WTO rules, and it is not clear what will be counted as trans-shipped, but Mr Han fears this could prove a bigger problem for Thai companies than the standard tariff rate if the US insists on more local components, or fewer from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"South East Asia relies very heavily on China,\" he explains. \"China, by far, has the largest supply chain for electronics and many other industries, and they are the cheapest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We could buy materials from another part of the world. It would be a lot more expensive. But it would be virtually impossible for Thailand or Vietnam or the Philippines or Malaysia to get a very high threshold, say 50-60%, made within that country. And if that is the condition to get the US certificate of origin, then nobody's going to get the certificate of origin.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the moment very few of these details have been revealed. Despite President Trump claiming he has got zero percent tariffs for US goods coming into the Philippines and Indonesia, both those countries have said this is not correct, and that much still needs to be negotiated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the Thai government, having started so late, and struggled to meet US demands, just getting a deal will have been a relief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They will worry about how to make the deal work later, as the details are worked out, which typically takes years. And in that, they are far from alone – rich and developing economies alike are scrambling to keep up with Trump's mercurial tariff policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At some point this has to stop. Surely it has to stop?\" Mr Han says. \"The trouble is, we don't know what the rules of the game are going to be, so we're all milling around, just waiting to find out how to play the new game.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
