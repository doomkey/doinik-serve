The vote was widely dismissed on the international stage as neither free nor fair, and many nations view his rule as illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to address this regime not as a conventional dictatorship, but as a criminal structure,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado accused his regime of being funded by criminal activities such as drugs and human trafficking, repeating calls for the international community to help Venezuela \"cut those inflows\" of criminal resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has always vehemently denied being connected to cartels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked whether she would support a US military strike on Venezuelan soil, given <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3v15zkxpe0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Washington's recent attacks on alleged drug vessels</a>, Machado did not answer directly but instead accused Maduro of \"giving away our sovereignty to criminal organisations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We didn't want a war, we didn't look for it… it was Maduro who declared war on the Venezuelan people,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado says she and her team are ready to form a government in Venezuela, and that she offered to sit down with Maduro's team to work out a peaceful transition, but \"they rejected it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked Jorgen Watne Frydnes, chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who sat with Machado during the interview, whether a possible violent takeover to unseat Nicolás Maduro would contradict her Peace Prize.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the burden for peace should be placed on the current Venezuelan government: \"The power lies in the Maduro regime, they have the responsibility to make sure this is a peaceful transition.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Moment Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado appears on Oslo balcony</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even after she was barred from the election last year, Machado continued to campaign for the candidate who replaced her on the ballot, Edmundo González.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was declared the winner, even though polling station tallies showed that González had won by a landslide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maduro government has repeatedly threatened Machado with arrest, accusing her of calling for a foreign invasion and labelling her a terrorist for protesting against the election results. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Venezuela's attorney general said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33mnvy5zppo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Machado would be considered a fugitive if she travelled to Norway</a> to collect her prize, saying she was accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, and terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It made her journey to Norway difficult and risky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The details of the trip were kept so tightly under wraps, that even the Nobel Institute did not know where she was or whether she would be in Oslo in time for the prize ceremony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/disguised-and-in-danger-how-a-nobel-peace-prize-winner-escaped-venezuela-8146dc9d?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdBKK949YHntGZFyH3qNdpF-N5mlbRPG1baZMp2LHkSAY9scbVsnfr9oOW2jdY%3D&amp;gaa_ts=693a38be&amp;gaa_sig=42bN-qmh6kWGTn3EpA-VuU0iT7A0MG68clDP8ba94oYXKwXx39nITXX2C21tGkPAiRj7rY_la5nbTZGQ4ogJWQ%3D%3D\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Wall Street Journal</a> reports that to escape Venezuela, Machado wore a disguise, managed to get through 10 military checkpoints without being caught, and sailed away on a wooden skiff from a coastal fishing village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan was two months in the making, it reports, citing a person close to the operation, and she was assisted by a Venezuelan network that helps people flee the country.

Earlier, President Maduro declared that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration accuses Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US and has intensified its efforts to isolate President Maduro in recent months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brent crude prices inched higher on Wednesday as news of the seizure stoked short-term supply concerns. Analysts warn the move could threaten shippers and further disrupt Venezuela's oil exports.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Attorney General Pam Bondi, who leads the US Department of Justice, said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the US Coast Guard co-ordinated the seizure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" the nation's top prosecutor wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage shared by Bondi showed a military helicopter hovering over a large ship, and troops descending on to the deck using ropes. Uniformed men were seen in the clip moving about the ship with guns drawn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior military official told the BBC's US partner CBS that the helicopters used in the operation launched from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which was sent to the Caribbean last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It involved two helicopters, 10 Coast Guard members and 10 Marines, as well as special forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Venezuela’s Maduro sings \"Don't worry, be happy\" as he calls for peace with the US</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth was aware of the operation, and the Trump administration was considering more actions like this, a source told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil on the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify located this tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows it was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days ago. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper's port of call log shows it called in Iran, Iraq, and the UAE from 30 June to 9 July this year. Its most recent stop, according to MarineTraffic, was at Soroosh port in Iran on 9 July, BBC Verify has found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That does not mean that it has not called at multiple other ports since then.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MarineTraffic shows it was last near Iran in mid-September before arriving off the coast of Guyana at the end of October and making minimal further movement since then.

It came in the form of a 1988 hit song.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To American citizens who are against the war, I respond with a very famous song: Don't worry, be happy,\" Maduro said in Spanish before singing along to the lyrics of the 1988 hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not war, be happy. Not, not crazy war, not, be happy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's unclear if Maduro knew about the seizure of the tanker before this rally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, the US has ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The build-up involves thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BBC Verify reported</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move has sparked speculation about the potential for some kind of military action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since September, the US has conducted at least 22 strikes on boats in the region that the Trump administration says are smuggling drugs.

We have to catch up with richer countries and with these measures I think we can evolve more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But self-employed photographer Eduardo Ferreira says he knows many people who already cannot find secure jobs and is pleased to see the unions unite at a \"critical moment\" for Portugal: \"Things have been tough ever since the troika, and workers haven't reacted until now.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CGTP has condemned the package as \"an assault on the rights of all workers, particularly women and young people\", while the UGT calls it \"so out of step, in a context of economic growth, financial stability and a strong labour market, that… it reflects a clear bias in favour of employers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UGT also complains that formal talks between unions, government and business were \"unbalanced, restrictive and detrimental to workers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Montenegro's governing coalition lacks a majority in parliament, and is seeking support for the bill not only from the small, free-market Liberal Initiative (IL) but from hard-right Chega, which since May's general election has been the second-largest party. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, André Ventura, has expressed reservations about the way some measures might affect family life, but looks open to negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the election, Montenegro had ruled out deals with Chega, and the unions and the third-biggest party, the Socialists, say the prime minister's mask has slipped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also warn that politicians on the right want to amend Portugal's 1976 constitution to loosen employment safeguards considered among Europe's strongest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue has also become caught up in the campaign for January's presidential election, with several candidates arguing that the labour reform bill flouts Portugal's 1976 constitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Portugal's \"semi-presidential\" system, the head of state can decline to sign bills approved by parliament. Bills can instead be sent to the Constitutional Court for review or the president can exercise a veto that, while it can be overturned by a majority of elected MPs, delays the process, ensuring further discussion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the government seeking to overhaul so much of the labour code, such scrutiny might stoke voter unease about its radicalism, particularly since the plans were not in the coalition's election manifesto.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike many strikes here, Thursday's day of action is not limited to the public sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Portugal's largest factory, VW-owned Autoeuropa, south of Lisbon, almost 1,000 employees voted unanimously last week to back it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe there is no worker in this country unaffected by the negative measures in this reform,\" said UGT secretary-general Mário Mourão, after the Autoeuropa gathering. \"It must be responded to appropriately.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

event.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new raft of measures designed to protect the integrity of the vote was approved at an EBU summit last week, after which most countries confirmed they

It is so much more: it is culture, tradition, work, wealth.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For millions of fans the news confirms what they already believed - from Sicilian Cannoli to Calabrian 'Nduja - Italian is the best. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement was made during a Unesco assembly meeting in the Indian capital Delhi on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cultural agency described Italian cuisine as a \"means of connecting with family and the community, whether at home, in schools, or through festivals, ceremonies and social gatherings\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Koshary, the spicy dish of lentils, rice, and pasta available at countless Egyptian food stalls, was also added to the list of intangible cultural heritage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other countries have had their \"practices, skills, traditions and social practices related to foodways\" recognised by Unesco, a spokesperson from the agency told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous examples include \"Washoku, traditional dietary cultures of the Japanese, notably for the celebration of New Year, Breakfast culture in Malaysia: dining experience in a multi-ethnic society, or the Gastronomic meal of the French,\" the spokesperson added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, chef Michelangelo Mammoliti said the news filled him with a great sense of pride both personally as an Italian, as well as professionally as a chef. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Italy is one of the nations where regional cuisine has a very big impact on culture and traditions,\" said the chef, whose restaurant La Rei Natura in Piedmont is the only new three-star restaurant in the 2026 Michelin Guide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Italy's industry leaders and government ministers will be hoping that the move further boosts tourism to the country, which already welcomes 80 million international visitors annually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Luigi Scordamaglia, CEO of Filiera Italia, which represents all the food and wine companies in the production chain, told Ansa news agency that the move from Unesco marked a success \"for the entire Made in Italy supply chain\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Scordamaglia also spoke about the role of the Mediterranean diet in promoting good health.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"When we talk about the Mediterranean diet, we're talking about our wonderful Italian cuisine, which shares its principles, first and foremost those of balance and variety.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swimming pool culture in Iceland; the practice of Cuban Son music and dance; and the art of playing, singing and making the lahuta from Albania also entered Unesco's list of intangible cultural heritage. </p></div></div></body></html>"

href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckgyzl1mlkvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Rwanda's army is in \"de facto control of M23 operations\".</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 200,000 people have fled their homes in eastern DR Congo since the latest round of fighting started early this month, the UN says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said at least 74 people had been killed, mostly civilians, and 83 admitted to hospital with wounds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Burundian administrative source told AFP that he had recorded more than 8,000 daily arrivals over the past two days, and 30,000 arrivals in one week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest offensive comes nearly a year after the M23 rebels seized control of Goma and Bukavu, the other two main cities in eastern DR Congo. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 is not part of the US-brokered peace deal, and is in separate talks with DR Congo's government in mediation efforts led by Qatar. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a national address on Monday, Tshisekedi accused Rwanda of \"deliberate violations\" of the peace accord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a proxy war aimed at challenging our sovereignty over a highly strategic area, rich in critical minerals and economic potential that is crucial to the future of our nation,\" Tshisekedi said.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, Rwanda accused the armies of DR Congo and Burundi of bombing villages near its border, forcing more than 1,000 civilians to flee into its territory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Several peace deals going back to the 1990s have collapsed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-richard-kagoe\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Richard Kagoe</i></p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">More about the DR Congo conflict:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Experts have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdjzw3gplv7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">raised questions over the legality of the strikes</a>, which have killed more than 80 people.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the US of using the strikes to destabilise the country and oust him from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview conducted with Politico the day before the jets approached Venezuela's coastline, Trump declared that Maduro's days in power were \"numbered\", and declined to comment on whether US troops could be deployed to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A separate jet, an EA-18G Growler, also appeared just before the F/A-18s on the tracking site FlightRadar24. Data shows the jet flew loops just north of Venezuela's coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are the latest in a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cly1ydnq5n2t?post=asset%3A21821676-9496-4ef0-9ea8-ad46c19764b0#post\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">number of unusual US air force activities that have been tracked</a> since September. B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bombers previously flew up to and along the Venezuelan coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the F/A-18s, which are capable of engaging targets both on the ground and in the air, appear to be the first to approach the Venezuelan coastline so publicly in recent months. The F/A-18s came within 20 nautical miles of the coastline, flight tracking data showed, but the US official said the jets remained in international airspace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neither the F/A-18s or the Growler showed a point of origin or a destination on FlightRadar24, and all three aircraft only turned on their transponders when they arrived near the Venezuelan coastline. Justin Crump, head of the risk consultancy Sibylline, suggested the move was intended to \"support the administration's signalling and put pressure on the [Venezuelan] leadership\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The F/A-18s - which operated under the callsigns RHINO11 and RHINO12 - flew six loops up and down the Gulf of Venezuela. Meanwhile, the Growler jet - flying under the codename GRIZZLY2 - also flew circles along the coast. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bagwell, a former RAF air marshal and president of the Air and Space Power Association, told BBC Verify that the flights appeared to be \"probing\" Venezuelan defence and trying to check for responses such as radio traffic and encrypted signals related to defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Growlers would have been listening for [signals intelligence], whilst the Super Hornets would have been providing air defence cover for the Growlers,\" Baswell said. He said the Growlers would also detect \"active missile sites\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could be construed as the early gathering of intelligence for subsequent operations, or just a warning of such,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crump said the jets also had the capacity to test out \"jamming capabilities\", adding: \"This also helps send a message, when successful, potentially indicating to Venezuela's leadership that these systems cannot or should not be relied upon,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">deployed troops, ships and jets to the Caribbean</a> in recent months, which officials have said is to combat drug trafficking in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday the US Southern Command published photos of an F/A-18 operating from the USS Gerald Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, which has been sent to the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysis of satellite images and ship tracking websites by BBC Verify has made it possible to identify at least nine military vessels that have been deployed to the region over recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite images also show that an airbase in Puerto Rico, which was closed in 2004 by the Pentagon, has been re-activated. Repairs have been carried out to the runway at Roosevelt Roads base and F-35s - America's most advanced fighter - have been sent to the base.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It can potentially be traumatic,\" she told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Sperm Bank said: \"It is important, especially in light of this case, to remember that thousands of women and couples do not have the opportunity to have a child without the help of donor sperm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is generally safer to have a child with the help of donor sperm if the sperm donors are screened according to medical guidelines.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What if you are considering using a sperm donor?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sarah Norcross said these cases were \"vanishingly rare\" when you consider the number of children born to a sperm donor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All of the experts we spoke to said using a licensed clinic meant the sperm would be screened for more diseases than most fathers-to-be are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Pacey said he would ask \"is this a UK donor or is this a donor from somewhere else?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If it's a donor from somewhere else I think it's legitimate to ask questions about has that donor been used before?

A grotesque, charred silhouette, reclining, with one knee raised, as if lounging on one of Marseille's nearby beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was 15 when he died, in the usual way: a bullet in the head, then petrol poured over his slim corpse and set on fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Someone even filmed the scene on the beach, the latest in a grim series of shoot-then-burn murders linked to this port city's fast-evolving drug wars, increasingly fuelled by social media and now marked by chillingly random acts of violence and by the growing role of children, often coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's chaos now,\" said a scrawny gang-member, lifting his shirt in a nearby park to show us a torso marked by the scars of at least four bullets - the result of an attempted assassination by a rival gang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France's Ministry of Justice estimates that the number of teenagers involved in the drugs trade has risen more than four-fold in the past eight years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've been in [a gang] since I was 15. But everything has changed now. The codes, the rules – there are no more rules. Nobody respects anything these days. The bosses start... to use youngsters. They pay them peanuts. And they end up killing others for no real reason. It's anarchy, all over town,\" said the man, now in his early 20s, who asked us to use his nickname, The Immortal.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Immortal, a Marseille gang member, showing his bullet wounds from a rival gang attack</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across Marseille, police, lawyers, politicians and community organisers talk of a <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> – a state of collective trauma or panic – gripping parts of the city, as they debate whether to fight back with ever tougher police action or with fresh attempts to address entrenched poverty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's an atmosphere of fear. It's obvious that the drug traffickers are dominant, and gaining more ground every day,\" said a local lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against her or her family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The rule of law is now subordinate to the gangs. Until we have a strong state again, we have to take precautions,\" she said, explaining her recent decision to stop representing victims of gang violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's so much competition in the drugs trade that... people are ready to do anything. So, we have kids aged 13 or 14 who come in as lookouts or dealers. The young see dead bodies, they hear about it, every day. And they're no longer afraid of killing, or being killed,\" community organiser Mohamed Benmeddour told us.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trigger for Marseille's current <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> was the murder, last month, of Mehdi Kessaci, a 20-year-old trainee policeman with no links to the drug trade. It is widely believed his death was intended as a warning to his brother, a prominent 22-year-old anti-gang activist and aspiring politician named Ahmed Kessaci.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under close police protection now, Kessaci spoke to the BBC about Mehdi's death, and the guilt he feels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Should I have made my family leave [Marseille]? The struggle of my life is going to be this fight against guilt,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images French anti-drug activist Amine Kessaci (C) and his mother Ouassila Benhamdi Kessaci (L) gather to take part in a march in tribute to Mehdi Kessaci at the roundabout where he was murdered and to protest against drug trafficking, in Marseille, southern France on November 22, 2025. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">French anti-drug activist Amine Kessaci (centre) is mourning his brother Mehdi, who was murdered in Marseille</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed Kessaci first rose to national prominence in 2020, after his older brother, a gang member named Brahim, was also murdered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had this <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> for years. We've known that our lives are hanging by a single thread. But everything changed since Covid. The perpetrators are getting younger and younger. The victims are younger and younger,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My little brother was an innocent victim. There was a time when the real thugs... had a moral code. You don't kill in daytime. Not in front of everyone. You don't burn bodies. First you threaten with a shot to the leg... Today these steps have all disappeared.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Citing today's \"unprecedented\" levels of violence, French police are responding with what they call security \"bombardments\" in high-crime areas of Marseille.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although one gang, the DZ Mafia, now appears to dominate the trade, it operates a kind of franchise system, with a fractious network of small distributors often staffed by teenagers and undocumented immigrants, who clash violently over territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to one estimate, up to 20,000 people may be involved in the city's drug industry. Last year officials confiscated €42m (£36m) in criminal assets from the gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video footage shared on social media routinely shows gang members, armed with automatic rifles, shooting at each other in Marseille's various <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i> – poor neighbourhoods characterised by high-rise buildings and a concentration of social housing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold afternoon last week, we accompanied a group of armed riot police on one of their regular \"bombardment\" missions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers sped up to a dilapidated block of flats in their vans as a youthful gang look-out on the gate promptly fled on foot. Splitting into two groups, the police ran up either side of the building seeking to catch dealers in the stairwells.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The aim is to disrupt the drug dealing spots. We've closed more than 40 of them... and we've locked up a lot of people,\" explained Sébastien Lautard, a regional police chief.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC films arrests in Marseille drug raid</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Turn him round,\" said an officer, brusquely, as his team pinned an 18-year-old up against a door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a filthy cellar nearby, the police found dozens of vials and tiny plastic bags used to distribute cocaine. Later, a policeman explained that the young man they had detained was pleading to be arrested, saying he had come to Marseille from another city, and was now being held against his will and forced to work for a drug gang. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers took him away in a van.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not El Dorado. We have a lot of youngsters recruited on social media. They come to Marseille thinking they'll make easy money. They're promised €200 ($233;£175) a day. But it often ends in misery, violence and sometimes death,\" said the city's chief prosecutor, Nicolas Bessone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his office close to the city's old harbour, Bessone described an industry thought to be worth up to €7bn nationwide and characterised by two new developments: a growing emphasis on online recruitment, sales, and delivery; and a rising number of teenagers coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We now see how the traffickers enslave these... little soldiers. They create fictional debts to make them work for free. They torture them if they steal €20 to buy a sandwich. It's ultra-violence. The average age of the perpetrators and victims is getting younger and younger,\" said Bessone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He urged local people not to succumb to a <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> but instead to \"react, to rise up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawyer who asked us to hide her identity described a case she had handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One young person, who absolutely didn't want to be part of a network, was picked up after school, forced to participate in the drugs trade, was raped, then threatened, then his family also threatened. All means are used to create a workforce,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tiktok, dozens of videos, set to music, advertise drugs for sale in Marseille's <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i>, \"from 10:00 to midnight\", each product with its own emoji, for cocaine, hashish and marijuana. Other adverts seek to recruit new gang members with messages like \"recruiting a worker\", \"€250 for lookouts\", \"€500 to carry drugs\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For some local politicians, the answer to Marseille's troubles is a state of emergency, and far tougher rules on immigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Authority must be restored. We need to end a culture of permissiveness in our country. We need to give more freedom, more power to the police and the judiciary,\" said Franck Alissio, a local MP for the populist, far-right National Rally party, and a prospective mayoral candidate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the ancient Mediterranean city of Marseille has, for centuries, been known for its large immigrant community, Alissio argued that \"today, the problem is that we are no longer able to integrate economically and assimilate. Too much immigration. It's the number [of immigrants] that's the problem. And in fact, the drug traffickers, dealers, lookouts, the leaders of these mafia, are almost all immigrants or foreigners with dual nationality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a controversial claim that is hard to verify in a country that strives to avoid including such details in official figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alissio claimed that billions of euros had been poured into Marseille's poorest neighborhoods by successive governments to no effect. He blamed parents and schools for allowing children into the drugs trade but added that he was focused on \"solving the problem, not doing sociology\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right parties have long enjoyed strong support across the south of France, but less so in the diverse city of Marseille itself. Critics of the RN, like the lawyer whose identity we have concealed, accused the party of \"exploiting misery and fear,\" and wrongly blaming immigrants for a \"gangrene\" that is widespread across all communities in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Philippe Pujol, a local writer and expert on the drug trade in Marseille, was also offered police protection after the murder of Mehdi Kessaci last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not sure if there's a good reason for this terror. But... terror is taking hold. I would rather be afraid and careful than take unnecessary risks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he hit back against calls for tougher police action, arguing it was merely nursing the symptoms \"of a suffering society\", rather than treating the causes of the problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Describing entrenched poverty as a \"monster,\" Pujol painted a picture of a society radicalised by decades of neglect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The monster is a mixture of patronage, corruption, and political and economic decisions made against the public interest,\" Pujol said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These kids can be jerks when they're in a group, but when you're alone with them, they're still children, with dreams, who don't want this violence.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

You buy a certain sum in Swiss francs but download it in bitcoin onto a digital wallet on your phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I walk through the centre of Lugano, down a high street where just about all the shops sell luxury stuff. Jewellery or expensive clothes mainly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a shop called Vintage Nassa that sells new and second-hand bags and watches, the owner Cherubino Fry tells me he accepts bitcoin because the processing fee he has to pay per transaction is less than those charged by credit card companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For bitcoin it is generally below 1%, while for debit cards it can be as high as 1.7%, and up to 3.4% for credit cards. Although for the latter two it can vary from country to country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I ask Mr Fry if he does much business in bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In reality, not a lot. For now, only sporadically, only some clients,\" he says. \"But using bitcoin will be like a tree growing, and this tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Users pay via bitcoin using a suitable app on their mobile phone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A stone's throw from Mr Fry's shop, I visit the headquarters of Plan B, an initiative launched in 2022 by the City of Lugano in collaboration with crypto currency platform Tether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the B standing for bitcoin, its stated aim is to educate people about cryptocurrency, and \"to make Lugano the European hub for bitcoin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I want to talk about an experiment I did this July,\" says Plan B hub director Mir Liponi. She explains that she had a problem with her bank, which resulted in her not being able to access her funds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For 11 days she had no way of paying, other than with bitcoin, but she says that experiment turned out well, and that you can mostly survive just on bitcoin in Lugano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's missing public transportation at the moment… another one is fuel. Groceries are okay. I got things delivered at home, even.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Plenty of medical places, but not a dentist. And another big thing is [energy] bills. You cannot pay bills in bitcoin yet.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liponi adds that in the future she wants to see \"circular economies where people earn bitcoin, keep bitcoin, spend bitcoin, pay for services in bitcoin\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet elsewhere, similar bitcoin projects to Lugano's have come unstuck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021, El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar. To encourage its use the government gave people the bitcoin equivalent of $30 that they downloaded via an app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So what people did was download the app, exchange the bitcoin for dollars and never use it again,\" says Vincent Charles, head of crypto currency firm Unchain Data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went to El Salvador earlier this year to see how bitcoin uptake was going, and concluded that people don't really use it, and retailers and service providers rarely accept it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there are other successful bitcoin adoption examples from around the globe. Slovenian capital Ljubljana was declared the world's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:94eac69ce094b:0-slovenia-s-capital-of-ljubljana-ranked-as-world-s-most-crypto-friendly-city/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">most crypto-friendly city</a> in a report back in April, followed by Hong Kong and Zurich.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Shopkeeper Cherubino Fry expects the use of bitcoin to grow strongly</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Lugano, not everyone is seemingly impressed with bitcoin. In a park on the lakefront there used to be a statue representing Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the unknown person or persons who claim to have invented the crypto currency back in 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, vandals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vandalism-against-satoshi-nakamoto-statue-130409546.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">broke the sculpture</a> into bits and threw it into Lake Lugano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's interesting because not that many things get vandalised around here,\" says Lucia, a passerby who lives in the city. \"People are usually fairly well behaved. And you don't see often people having very strong political opinions either.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds, though, that she herself is skeptical of cryptocurrencies in general.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the University of Lugano where I study there's a club to promote bitcoin and everything. I do find it surprising that institutions such as my university would promote cryptocurrencies so much.

He says that bitcoin is a risk for shopkeepers in Lugano or elsewhere because of its volatility – its value can go sharply up and down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, he says it is important that they instantly convert the bitcoin they receive into Swiss francs, euros, or another currency issued by a government or central bank. These are also known as \"fiat\" currencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds: \"There is also a reputational risk with those cryptocurrencies used in illegal transactions, which could affect the city of Lugano and its financial institutions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Rossi also cautions that people's bitcoin is held by a digital third party, which makes it risky. \"If the platform where my digital wallet is recorded fails or goes bankrupt, my cryptocurrencies disappear instantaneously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And therefore, I lose the corresponding amount forever. By contrast, in Switzerland, all bank deposits are guaranteed up to the amount of 100,000 Swiss francs ($125,000; £94,000). This means that if the bank where my savings are recorded goes bankrupt, I can recover them up to this amount.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Lugano town hall I ask Mayor Michele Foletti if he is concerned that Lugano could be a magnet for mafia money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No. You can use fiat money to do something good or something bad,\" he says. \"The same with bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And mafia people are more interested to use fiat for money laundering. When they sell drugs or something like this, they receive [physical] fiat money, not bitcoin because the more anonymous way is cash,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that bitcoin continues to be positive for Lugano, and that 110 crypto-sector companies have now moved to, or started up, in the city.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Perhaps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if all he achieves is another ceasefire it will only be a matter of time before fighting breaks out again. And Thailand has said repeatedly that it is not yet ready for diplomacy. Cambodia, it says, must show sincerity before it is ready to try for a ceasefire again. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What that means exactly is not clear, but at the very least it would require a decisive and verified end to the use of land-mines on the border.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Investments into some parts of the value chain - such as <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgr417pwek7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">data centres</a>, the physical backbone of AI, or chip-making facilities - have begun trickling in. Just this week, American chipmaker Intel announced a collaboration with Mumbai-based Tata Electronics to manufacture chips locally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to a sovereign AI model, it appears India is continuing to play catch-up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About a year-and-a-half ago, the Indian government launched an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8qglr9r74o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">AI mission </a>through which it began supplying start-ups, universities and researchers with high-end computing chips to develop a large homegrown AI model like OpenAI or China's DeepSeek.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the federal electronics ministry, the launch of the sovereign model  - which supports more than 22 languages - is imminent. In the interim though, the likes of DeepSeek and OpenAI have made further advances, launching newer variants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the government has recognised the need to reduce over-dependence on foreign platforms because of the risk of surveillance and sanctions, India's $1.25bn sovereign mission is a shadow of France's $117bn or Saudi Arabia's $100bn programmes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's ambitions also face numerous other hurdles - from semiconductor availability to skilled talent and fragmented data ecosystems, according to global consultancy EY. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India currently lacks enough computational infrastructure or the billions of dollars of research and development (R&amp;D) investment made over decades that gave China and the US a distinct leg up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its global strength in AI talent, India struggles to keep its developers at home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The current tightening of overseas work visas provides India a window of opportunity to retain domestic talent and attract Indian-origin talent at home. However, given that top-tier AI talent is mobile globally, attractive policy incentives need to be put in place to incentivise relocation to India,\" the EY report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China, for example, offers a range of incentives such as \"financial support and subsidies, tax incentives and funding for research and development, special talent visas and fast-track immigration\", the report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has a much higher concentration of AI-skilled professionals than the global average - specifically, 2.5 times more. Policies that retain this talent are not yet in place.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2146/live/1d932ec0-d4cb-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Industrial chiller at Yotta Data Services data centre, in Navi Mumbai, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">India has been attracting billions of dollars of investments into data centres </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, despite the challenges, India - along with countries like Brazil and the Philippines - punches above its weight in AI, especially in the context of its stage of economic development, an UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) study said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the widely tracked Stanford AI Index 2025, the country ranks among the top five in the world on new companies receiving AI investments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, 74 new Indian AI startups received funding - a fraction of the more than 1,000  funded in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indian AI startups raised just $1.16bn privately, compared with over $100bn in the US and nearly $10bn in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's enough intellectual engagement with AI in India, with the country accounting for 9.2% of AI article publications - slightly more than the US, but behind Europe and China according to the Stanford AI Index.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say India's AI edge may lie less in building costly language models and more in using them downstream to spur entrepreneurship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think in the short term, there's this big concentration of AI in the US. But over the next five-10 years, AI will have a massively democratising effect on the creation of new companies. Small founders and entrepreneurs will be numerous and the downstream effect will be amazing for places like India and the Asia-Pacific,\" Shailendra Singh, managing director of Peak XV Partners which invests in AI start-ups, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Singh says India is seeing a surge in AI-powered consumer apps, with AI startup investments doubling from last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moreover, many Indian startups are now using AI to tackle real-world challenges for millions still on the wrong side of the digital divide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, MahaVISTAAR, an AI app run by the Maharashtra government, delivers vital agricultural information in the local Marathi language, reaching over 15 million farmers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hardest places to make artificial intelligence work are also the places where it matters most.

This is his 216-page memoir.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Told he would have to spend 23 hours out of 24 in his room – and that contact with anyone other than a prison employee was forbidden – the former president chose not to take the option of a daily walk in the yard, \"more like a cage than a place of promenade\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead he took his daily exercise on a running machine in the tiny sports room, which \"became – in my situation – a veritable oasis\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Media thronged Sarkozy's book signing in central Paris on Wednesday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is plenty more like this: how he was kept awake on his first night by a neighbour in the isolation wing singing a song from The Lion King and rattling his spoon along the bars of his cell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How he was \"touched by the kindness, delicacy and respect of the prison staff… each one of who addressed me by the title Président\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And how he was able to cover the walls of his cell with postcards from all the people writing to express their support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Touching and sincere, it bore witness to a deep personal bond even though I'd left office so long ago,\" he writes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The details fascinate. Perhaps more consequential are the ruminations on fate, justice and politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sarkozy was sent to jail after a court found him guilty of criminal association for allowing subordinates to try to raise election money 20 years ago from Libya's Colonel Gaddafi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the end of the trial in October, the judge – who could have allowed Sarkozy to remain at liberty pending his appeal – ruled instead that he should go to jail. Three weeks after his incarceration, he was allowed out following a plea from his lawyers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former president strongly denies the charges against him, and claims to be the victim of a politically-motivated cabal within the French justice system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is all rehearsed again in the book. Indeed at one point Sarkozy compares himself with France's most famous victim of justice, Alfred Dreyfus – the Jewish officer who was sent to Devil's Island on a trumped-up espionage charge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For any impartial observer who knows their history, the similarities are striking,\" he writes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Dreyfus affair originated from fake documents. So did mine… Dreyfus was degraded in front of the troops, when they stripped him of his decorations.

It's about whether UK defence has been under-funded for so long that it has now reached the point where the country is dangerously vulnerable in several areas, notably air defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also problems of timing and inefficiency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence contracts often take years to come to fruition.

Meanwhile, Nato officers have been warning Russia could be in a position to launch an attack on a Nato country within three to five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the end of the Cold War (between Nato and the Soviet Union) in 1990, when I was a young infantry Captain in the Army Reserves, the UK was spending 4.1% of GDP on defence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The following year it deployed over 45,000 troops to help evict Iraq President Saddam Hussein's invading army from Kuwait in operation Desert Storm. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, with multiple pressures on the economy, the government is striving to meet a target of 2.5% of GDP by 2027, while Russia spends close to 7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On paper, the British Army numbers around 74,000 but Rusi's Ed Arnold points out that once you subtract medically non-deployable soldiers, defence attaches around the world and others not part of formed units, then its actual deployable strength is only 54,000. That is less than the average number of casualties Russia takes in two months in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the event of a war, says Justin Crump of Sibylline, on land the (British) Army would most likely be degraded – incapable of fighting effectively - within weeks, once committed, though he adds \"much depends on the form of the conflict\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Suggestions the UK is already 'at war'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some commentators have suggested that the UK is already \"at war\" with Russia.

This is all that separates Russian ally Belarus from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seizing that border and opening up a route along it would, in theory, give Moscow direct access to its strategic base on the Baltic.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Baltic states themselves are other potential flashpoints.

The vast hinterland is her own backyard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet, like most teenagers, she's also attached to her smartphone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The all-terrain buggy she uses to herd cattle is fitted with an internet extender, enabling her to message friends on Snapchat while working. On days she gets a little bored, she likes to make funny TikTok videos with her siblings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With nearly all her friends living at least 100km away, social media is a lifeline. But not anymore, now that Australia's social media ban for children has taken effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Taking away our socials is just taking away how we talk to each other,\" Breanna says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While she can still text her friends, it's not the same as a quick \"snap\" or a \"like\" on a photo that allows her to play a part in their lives even when she is far away.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban has been in the making for a year now. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout, supporters have argued it's for the wellbeing of children who they say are spending too much time online and risk being exposed to uncontrollable pressures, bullying and predators. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents say restricting children's access to the internet runs the risk of pushing them to even less regulated corners of it - and they question the effectiveness of the age-verification tech the ban relies on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The debate is far from settled but Australia's experiment has now begun, and Breanna is among millions of children under the age of 16 who are no longer allowed to use social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And among them are children who are seen as both winning - saved from the potential dangers of social media - and losing out - no longer having the community and connections that may have been harder to forge offline.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Megan Easton with her daughters, Breanna and Olivia - Megan worries the government is overstepping with the ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Breanna's mum Megan Easton, the ban is a mixed blessing. While she agrees kids need to be protected, she remembers her own childhood on a cattle station was far more isolating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We did feel very behind the other children at school because we had a somewhat sheltered life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Breanna, her older sister Olivia and younger brother Jacob all did remote classes for children in the outback who are unable to attend a physical school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For senior grades though, boarding school is the only option for a good education. So from the age of 11 or 12, the siblings have lived six hours away from home during term-time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We might be incredibly geographically isolated but we're not digitally illiterate and we have taken great measures in our family to make sure that we educate our children appropriately for the world ahead of them,\" Ms Easton says. \"I do think that it is a bit of government overstepping.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of her concerns is that delaying access to social media to 16 takes away power from parents to educate their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Usually around 12 is when they start looking for their peers to be more influential than their parents,\" she says. \"Even though it's young to get them on social media, we've staged their experiences with it and it's a great opportunity for us to let them have a few mistakes and then talk them through the processes of self-correcting.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jacinta Hickey, 14, says she is old enough to know right from wrong</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 2,000km away, teens in Sydney lead very different, far more connected lives. But they share similar worries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a bit insulting that they think we can't handle it,\" says 14-year-old Jacinta Hickey who attends Rosebank College in Sydney's inner west. \"I'm definitely mature enough to distinguish right from wrong and to know what's good and bad for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her teachers though couldn't be happier. \"I feel really passionate that as long as we can, we should preserve the innocence that comes through childhood,\" says Iris Nastasi, the principal at Rosebank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When smartphones started becoming popular in the early 2000s, she thought it would be an opportunity to teach children about technology. She embraced the change. Twenty years later, Ms Nastasi thinks very differently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's two in the morning, he or she does something that they wouldn't normally do and the fallout happens here. Relationships are damaged and we have to look into it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At 12, Lola Farrugia isn't on social media yet - and with the new law, she now won't be for another four years. But that doesn't faze her. She's happy enough with a flip phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're my school friends so I see them at school, I see them in sport - they're everywhere,\" says Lola, who's had coaching from her parents about the ills of social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My mom explained to me that social media is junk food for the brain,\" she says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you have a pantry and you clear [it], you're not craving anything, you know what I mean?\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lola, 12, is in favour of the ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Peter Malinauskas, the Premier of South Australia, is the man credited – or blamed, depending on your age - for clearing out the pantry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After his wife read The Anxious Generation by Jonathan Haidt, an American psychologist who sets out the ills of the smartphone and how it is rewiring childhood, Malinauskas set out to introduce state-level legislation hoping it could win federal support too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She put the book down on her lap and turned to me and said you've really got to do something about this,\" he told the BBC. \"And then I stopped and thought about it and thought maybe we actually can.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not even Malinauskas expected the speed at which it happened though. The Anxious Generation was published in March 2024. By late November, a federal law banning social media for under-16s was passed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's still a High Court challenge brought by two teens pending, possible battles with tech firms and a warning from US President Donald Trump about targeting American companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course you think through the potential repercussions of any move like this,\" Malinauskas says. \"But when you are talking about protecting young people, all other considerations become secondary.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But one of the biggest criticisms of the law is that a blanket restriction could do the opposite for minority groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a survey of nearly 1,000 young people carried out by Minus18, a group that supports under-18 LGBTQ+ communities, 96% of respondents said social media was important to access friends and support, and 82% believed a ban would leave them disconnected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brisbane schoolgirl Sadie Angus is one of them. She turned 13 just a few weeks ago and opening an Instagram account was a rite of passage for her. But it was a short-lived one - the law means she's now being kicked off it and she's frustrated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I can admit more things on there than I can in real life,\" says Sadie who often prefers to keep her anonymity online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I use it as a safe space to share what I've had to go through and since nobody knows who I am, they can't come to me in real life and talk about it and that feels kind of comforting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sadie's mother Kath felt it was an important step in her daughter - the youngest in their family - growing up and now that has been taken away from her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's being exposed to some really amazing role models through social media, particularly in the queer community which I think is really healthy for young adolescents,\" Ms Angus says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other minority groups have also voiced concern over the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am quite nervous about what this is going to mean for autistic young people,\" says Sharon Fraser, the CEO of Reframing Autism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We communicate and socialise differently,\" says Sharon who also has an autistic son. \"Online can be a very beneficial place for autistic people and there are ways to connect online that are just not accessible to them in real life.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: 'I don't need laws to teach my kids to be responsible', says Kath Angus</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For every young person who feels like they're losing out, campaigner Emma Mason thinks there will be far more winners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years ago, her daughter Tilly killed herself. She was 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emma blames the rise of social media for Tilly's death. Face-to-face bullying started when Tilly was just eight. It moved to messaging and then to platforms including Tiktok, Snapchat and Instagram. But it got worse after a fake image of Tilly was spread by children at her school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emma recalls how hysterical Tilly was when she found out: \"She was subject to something she had no control over, a harm that was instant, a harm that she could not stop. It was one of those moments in her life where she just lost it, she just thought I can't do this anymore, I can't keep fighting the demons.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mason doesn't want this to happen to other children, which is why she's been standing alongside Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to support this law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These are agents of harm that are unregulated and I think our children have been the social experiment,\" Emma says. \"It's a government's job to protect the vulnerable of our society and to provide guardrails for how things need to go.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She admits though, for those who are already teenagers, they might not be clear winners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't know that we can save the children that have had access to it already,\" she says. \"But those children that are 13 and below that aren't supposed to be on it now, they won't have to grow up in a world where it's acceptable that you just get on social media and you can say what you want, how you want, to whoever you want.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-simon-atkinson\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Simon Atkinson</i></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What do teenagers think about Australia's social media ban?</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Another suggested she couldn't be happy with a husband like that. Some labelled her a \"gold-digger,\" claiming she married him for wealth or a secure government job with perks. One comment suggested that Mr Rajput's father must be \"a government minister\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple, who married on 23 November, have since gone viral because of the trolling - and their response, as they addressed the criticism head-on. They have been sought out by local media and given scores of interviews in the past two weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People were making jokes and memes and it felt very wrong,\" Mr Rajput told BBC Hindi from his home in Jabalpur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was our moment and we had waited for it so many years. It was supposed to be a happy moment, but when I saw people's reactions, I was really shocked,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In so many years that we have been together, no-one had ever told us that we were a mismatch because I have dark complexion while she is fairer,\" he added.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d540/live/8e0afaf0-d428-11f0-93c0-4fd4a05b7c18.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC Hindi Sonali Chouksey and Rishabh Rajput after their wedding\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC Hindi</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sonali Chouksey and Rishabh Rajput met in college in 2014 and fell in love</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The nasty comments left the couple - who both work in private companies - reeling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Chouksey admitted that such comments \"bothered\" her. \"You think - is this is how people are perceiving us? When they say nasty things about him or call me a gold-digger, it irritates me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on Instagram, Mr Rajput addressed the trolls: \"Sorry to disappoint you. I'm not a government employee, but I work hard for my family and want to give them a good, dignified life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Sonali fell in love with him when he had nothing. \"From college till today, she has stood with me through every good and bad moment. People's negative opinions mean nothing to me,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput also addressed the issue of colourism in the comments, saying he had faced colour discrimination his whole life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I know very well that I have a dark complexion. But in my wife's eyes, I am trying to be the best husband I can be, and that is what matters the most. There is no need to speak wrongly about my family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput said he pushed back when the trolls began commenting on one of the photos that also had his mother and his and his wife's sisters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I did not like the fact that they targeted my family. I want to tell them, you are a nobody. And you have no right to target - or troll - anyone's family,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple, together since meeting in a 2014 college zoology class, say outsiders shouldn't judge their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our relationship began a year later and we knew from then that one day we would be married. Those who are commenting on our relationship by looking at a 30-second video don't know that it captures 11 years of hard work that we have put into it,\" says Mr Rajput.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sonali had always manifested that when we get married, our entire village should witness it. But today, it seems like the whole world is watching it,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That attention, the couple agree, feels good in a way. But the comments, Ms Chouksey adds, are hurting their families. \"For people, it may be just something they watch on social media, but it's our life. And it can destroy someone's family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple have also addressed colourism in several of their interviews.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We live in India where people from different regions have different skin colour. And fair skin doesn't necessarily make someone a good person. So, how can we judge someone on the basis of their skin colour?\" asks Ms Chouksey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Rajput says \"about 70-80% people in India have darker skin tones, but the Indian mentality is that fairer is better. It's time to change that notion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And for those who say the couple are a mismatch, he has a question: \"When you look at us, do we look even remotely unhappy to you? We don't. Because we have what most people don't have. I have her and she has me.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A Ukrainian soldier with the call sign Rabbit shows me passports and documents retrieved from their dead. I asked him if he thinks they have killed a lot of Russians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not enough,\" he replies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rabbit described the situation as \"hard, but under control\".

Nor does Rabbit agree with any suggestion that Ukraine should give up more land for peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says too much blood has already been spilt: \"We are part of this land. If we give it up Russia will want more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another soldier - call sign \"Ghost\" - fighting in another unit in Pokrovsk describes the situation as \"tense, but not critical\". He dismisses reports of its capture as \"Russian propaganda\", saying reports that \"Pokrovsk is surrounded is fake information\", but adds that \"everyone is exhausted – both Russia and Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ukraine, holding ground is also proving costly. The Skala Regiment shares recent videos taken by their troops on the front line - often having to take cover in buildings from Russian drones. The buzz of an approaching drone is often accompanied by heavy automatic fire as they try to bring it down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Khotabych\", who recently spent a month fighting in the city, says it is scary when the drones spot you: \"There are lots and they fly round the clock.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Russians have more drones with thermal imaging cameras, which can see at night. Khotabych said he and his men always hope for \"good weather\" – by which he means fog, rain and grey sky. In other words, anything that makes it more difficult to fly.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8091/live/11188420-d4d4-11f0-869b-9329731c64cd.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Matthew Goddard A man in a Ukrainian uniform with a balaclava and cap\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Matthew Goddard</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Skala Regiment's deputy commander, \"Godfather\", warns that Putin will not stop after Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Pokrovsk, Ukrainian soldiers are focused on the fighting, not peace talks.

the Economic Community of West African States - of which they had all been founding participants 50 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, faced with the prospect that yet another civilian government might be overturned by discontented soldiers, the presidents of the remaining Ecowas member states rapidly reached the conclusion that the attempted coup in Cotonou could not be allowed to succeed.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Learning from past mistakes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having fought off early morning putschist attacks on Talon's home and the presidency offices, loyalist forces had already reaffirmed government control across the city, locking down the main central administrative district. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was proving hard to break down the last-ditch resistance of rebel troops who had shown they were ready to use lethal force without regard for civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, Benin's eastern neighbour and much the largest military power in the region, authorised air strikes, while Ecowas leaders decided to despatch ground troops the same day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those sending forces is Ghana's President John Mahama, who leads a resilient democracy but has made friendly diplomatic overtures to the Sahelian military regimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In acting so quickly, Ecowas has perhaps learned a lesson from its misjudged response to the 2023 coup in Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On that occasion it was not practically organised to intervene militarily in the hours after the elected head of state, Mohamed Bazoum, had been detained by coup leaders – the only moment, perhaps, when a rapid commando raid to rescue him and secure key buildings might have had any chance of success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time the bloc had threatened intervention and begun to plan it, the chance had gone: the new junta had consolidated control over the Nigérien army and mobilised popular opinion in its support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Faced with the prospect of intervention becoming full-scale war, and under strong domestic popular pressure to avoid any such bloodbath, Ecowas leaders backed off - opting to rely on sanctions. And when those also proved counter-productive, they settled for the diplomatic path alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time around, in Benin, the situation was quite different: Talon was still in full control, even if some would-be putschists were still resisting.

At least one civilian – the wife of Talon's key military adviser – was killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgex2d3y3dxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In recent days two top military officials</a> abducted during Sunday's failed coup attempt have been rescued, but security forces are still searching for the coup leader Lt Col Pascal Tigri and other plotters.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Simmering grievances</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was just the latest in a string of coup attempts across the region, though most of the others have succeeded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have all occurred in a context of fragility and pressure in West Africa at a time of Islamist violence across the Sahel, now spreading into the northern regions of many coastal countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is disenchantment with traditional political elites. Even where economies are growing, there is a desperate shortage of jobs and viable livelihoods for the region's rapidly growing young population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, while the regional context is widely shared, the driving factors for the coups are often local - specific to each country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of popular support for the Cotonou putschists stands in stark contrast to the mood on the streets of Conakry, the capital of <b id=\"guinea\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea</b>, in September 2021, when the special forces commander, Col Mamady Doumbouya led the overthrow of then-President Alpha Condé.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Talon, Condé had first been democratically elected but later secured re-election in questionable conditions, and presided over a significant erosion of political freedoms. Yet in Guinea, Condé had presided over violent abuse on a far greater scale than in Benin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition, Condé had then strong-armed his way to a third term aged 83. In contrast the 67-year-old Talon has promised to step down next April, albeit having adjusted the electoral rules to almost guarantee an easy victory for his chosen successor, Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key difference is Condé's deeply disappointing economic track record, whereas Talon has presided over strong growth and improving services.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: People in Benin felt 'total fear' at attempted coup</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Further north, the wave of coups in the Sahelian countries in recent years were also driven by local conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"mali\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Mali </b>and <b id=\"burkina-faso\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Burkina Faso</b>, military commanders had grown frustrated with the weak leadership elected presidents were providing in the campaign against Islamist insurgents. In both countries, troops had repeatedly suffered brutal losses while their <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-62052598\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">civilian governments appeared incapable of mobilising the extra weapons or sometimes even food</a> that the troops needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also deep resentment at France's inability to bring the jihadists to heel, despite the high-tech weaponry at the disposal of its forces then deployed across the Sahel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also in Mali, some nationalist sections of political and military opinion were frustrated with the functioning of a 2015 peace agreement with former Tuareg separatists in the far north, overseen by UN troops. Hardliners even accused French forces of actively preventing Bamako from deploying national army units to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In <b id=\"niger\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Niger</b>, the circumstances surrounding the 2023 putsch were equally distinctive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Bazoum's political support had been eroded by his very publicly close partnership with France, and particularly his request that Paris provide troops to defend the north-western border from incursions by Mali-based jihadists. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, his vocal support for judges probing a corruption scandal in defence procurement also risked alienating powerful elements of the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coup that followed soon afterwards in <b id=\"gabon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Gabon</b>, in August 2023, was similarly the product of local frustrations. In this case the opaque management of election results that saw an implausible victory awarded to President Ali Bongo, in frail health after a slow recovery from a stroke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, circumstances vary widely. And recent events confirm the trend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The region certainly does face a real crisis of security and, in many countries, politics or development too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But national conditions are often the major driver for each upheaval or coup attempt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many suspect the military takeover in <b id=\"guinea-bissau\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Guinea-Bissau</b> aimed to forestall a possible opposition election victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whereas the Benin rebels seem to have been motivated by a mix of army grievances, and broader political and economic complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they strikingly misjudged the popular appetite in Cotonou for any violent or radical system change.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvd01g2kwwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">National Security Strategy published on Friday</a>, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services is common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
