For Hamas, it means handing over weapons and power. For Israel, handing over security to an international stabilisation force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this is also why leaders on both sides may be hesitating, says retired General Israel Ziv, a former head of Israel's military Operations Directorate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Israel and Hamas are sharing the same interests not to move so fast into the second stage,\" he told me. \"Hamas doesn't want to lose control, and the Israeli side for political reasons also prefer to stay in Gaza, as nobody wants to explain to their base that they have to withdraw.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says Trump is the only one who can force the two sides forward, and that time is running out.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By waiting I think we might miss the opportunity because Hamas is reorganising and [its] strength is coming back,\" he explained. \"We have to take a deep breath and go forward with that plan, because staying in the situation as it is, it's the worst-case scenario.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Disarming Hamas – in a way both sides will accept – is seen as the first major hurdle.  Without that, no foreign countries are likely to commit troops to secure the Strip, and no reconstruction is likely to begin in Hamas-controlled areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Netanyahu suggested he was sceptical that foreign nations could complete the task in place of Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our friends in America want to try to establish an international force that will do the job,\" he said. \"We know that there are certain tasks that this force can do.

(1) The avatar's bodily space, the potential actions of the avatar in the game world, is the only way in which the reality of the external reality of the game world can be perceived. (2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar. (5) The entire perceptual system has been extended into the game world.</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The correct answer is 3.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many have criticised the way the question and several others were worded. One user on Reddit called it \"fancy smart talking\" while another said it was \"awful writing [that] doesn't convey a concept or idea well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Students are given 70 minutes to attempt 45 questions. Just over 3% of this year's test-takers scored the highest grade for the English section, compared to 6% last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It took me a long time to figure out [several questions] and understanding the texts themselves was tricky... [Some] answers looked similar to each other. So I was unsure until the last minute,\" said Im Na-hye, a senior in Hanyeong High School.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But English language professor Jung Chae-kwan says it is a misnomer to call the English test tough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The texts aren't necessarily impossible, but... maddeningly confusing. It's a pain because it makes the material useless for actual education, \" says Prof Jung, who previously worked at the institution that administers the Suneung, and now teaches at Incheon National University. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Teachers end up drilling test-taking hacks rather than teaching English... You don't even really need to read the full text to get the points if you know the tricks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some pointed out that several passages used in the questions are excerpts from books that have been taken out of context, making them hard to comprehend. The above passage, for example, comes from Game Feel, a game design guide written by Steve Swink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others, however, believe the difficulty of the test reflects its intended purpose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It measures students' reading comprehension and whether they can handle the level of material they'll encounter in university,\" says Kim Soo-yeon, an English literature professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The passages chosen have \"some degree of specialisation\", which allows the test to assess such comprehension skills, she told The Korea Times.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's Suneung, held every November, is an infamous eight-hour marathon of back-to-back exams that not only dictates whether people will be able to go to university, but can also affect their job prospects, income and future relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Students attempt about 200 questions across various subjects, which include Korean, maths, English, social and natural sciences, among others. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many teenagers spend all their lives preparing for these exams - some of them sent to private tuition centres known as \"cram schools\" from as young as four.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Suneung is a monumental event for the rest of South Korea too, as it brings much of the country to a standstill for a single day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Construction work halts, planes are grounded and military training gets suspended to facilitate an optimal testing environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only four of the 12 Suneung chiefs since the exam debuted in 1993 have served out their full three-year terms.

It is a measure to protect the freedom of girls in this country,\" and added that the ban would affect about 12,000 children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition far-right Freedom Party of Austria, the FPÖ, which voted in favour of the ban, said it did not go far enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It described the ban as \"a first step\", which should be widened to include all pupils and school staff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There needs to be a general ban on headscarves in schools; political Islam has no place here\", the FPÖ's spokesperson on families Ricarda Berger said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sigrid Maurer from the opposition Greens called the new law \"clearly unconstitutional\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The official Islamic Community in Austria, the IGGÖ, said the ban violated fundamental rights and would split society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement  on its website, it said  \"instead of empowering children, they will be stigmatised and marginalised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IGGÖ said it would review \"the constitutionality of the law and take all necessary steps.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Constitutional Court already ruled unequivocally in 2020 that such a ban is unconstitutional, as it specifically targets a religious minority and violates the principle of equality,\" the IGGÖ said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says it has tried to avoid that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Will it pass muster with the Constitutional Court?

We have to catch up with richer countries and with these measures I think we can evolve more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But self-employed photographer Eduardo Ferreira says he knows many people who already cannot find secure jobs and is pleased to see the unions unite at a \"critical moment\" for Portugal: \"Things have been tough ever since the troika, and workers haven't reacted until now.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CGTP has condemned the package as \"an assault on the rights of all workers, particularly women and young people\", while the UGT calls it \"so out of step, in a context of economic growth, financial stability and a strong labour market, that… it reflects a clear bias in favour of employers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UGT also complains that formal talks between unions, government and business were \"unbalanced, restrictive and detrimental to workers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Montenegro's governing coalition lacks a majority in parliament, and is seeking support for the bill not only from the small, free-market Liberal Initiative (IL) but from hard-right Chega, which since May's general election has been the second-largest party. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, André Ventura, has expressed reservations about the way some measures might affect family life, but looks open to negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the election, Montenegro had ruled out deals with Chega, and the unions and the third-biggest party, the Socialists, say the prime minister's mask has slipped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also warn that politicians on the right want to amend Portugal's 1976 constitution to loosen employment safeguards considered among Europe's strongest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue has also become caught up in the campaign for January's presidential election, with several candidates arguing that the labour reform bill flouts Portugal's 1976 constitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Portugal's \"semi-presidential\" system, the head of state can decline to sign bills approved by parliament. Bills can instead be sent to the Constitutional Court for review or the president can exercise a veto that, while it can be overturned by a majority of elected MPs, delays the process, ensuring further discussion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the government seeking to overhaul so much of the labour code, such scrutiny might stoke voter unease about its radicalism, particularly since the plans were not in the coalition's election manifesto.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike many strikes here, Thursday's day of action is not limited to the public sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At Portugal's largest factory, VW-owned Autoeuropa, south of Lisbon, almost 1,000 employees voted unanimously last week to back it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe there is no worker in this country unaffected by the negative measures in this reform,\" said UGT secretary-general Mário Mourão, after the Autoeuropa gathering. \"It must be responded to appropriately.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Everything could fall apart for many reasons,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia demands that Ukraine relinquish control of roughly 30% of the eastern Donetsk region it still holds - something Ukraine has refused to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Zelensky, the US is now envisaging a solution that would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, and Russian forces committing to not advancing into the territory. This area would become a \"special economic zone\" or a \"demilitarised zone\", Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he noted that it would not be fair for the Ukrainians to withdraw unilaterally, and that Russia should also pull back by the same distance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said these were \"very serious concerns\" and that Ukraine might not accept the proposal at all – although he opened the door to elections or a referendum to give the Ukrainian people a choice.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he acknowledged that the fighting would continue and may yet shape the future of the negotiations: \"Much depends on our military – what they can hold, where they can stop the enemy, what they can destroy. This affects the entire configuration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was another highly contentious point, Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said a possible solution would be for the Russians to withdraw and Kyiv to share control of the plant with the Americans – although he acknowledged that the details of such an arrangement were still unclear, and it is doubtful that Moscow would agree.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the conflict, and Kyiv and its allies fear the Americans might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky told reporters that although the Americans wanted a \"quicker conclusion\" to the war, there were no deadlines for an agreement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine - which is targeted by widespread aerial attacks on a near-nightly basis - has been pushing for respite and would want an immediate ceasefire to be implemented ahead of a more laborious agreement being fleshed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia stands to gain more from a ceasefire being delayed, as its troops continue to make small but incremental gains on the frontline and its attacks exhaust the Ukrainian population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After multiple rounds of talks with Russia\" the Americans were now aligned on Moscow on this position, Zelensky said. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin officials have been more tight-lipped than their European, US and Ukrainian counterparts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, whenever possible, Russia has sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said a recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" between the two sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But neither Ukraine nor Europe will be likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value, given Russia has previously violated ceasefires and truce deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European and Ukrainian officials want the US to be involved in giving security guarantees so that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said he had received a draft proposal on American security guarantees but that the draft was a work in progress, suggesting that what has been offered by the US falls short of provisions that could assuage Kyiv's fears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US does not want Ukraine in Nato. They say this openly... So I do not think they have difficulties discussing Nato with the Russians,\" Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky also said Ukraine had to be \"cautious\", adding: \"We do not know what other agreements the US may have with Russia. We will learn in time.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's president also acknowledged that US support for Kyiv may one day end, both in terms of the flow of weapons that the US is selling through other countries and in terms of intelligence sharing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reflecting the fraught nature of the talks and his scepticism that Russia was negotiating in good faith, Zelensky told reporters: \"No one knows what may happen the day after tomorrow... We do not know how these negotiations will end.\"</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.</p></div></div></body></html>"

President Donald Trump has called on Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is it Venezuela's oil that Trump really wants? And would it actually be worth it?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How much oil does Venezuela have?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is true that with an estimated 303 billion barrels, Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the amount of oil the country actually produces today is tiny by comparison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Output has dropped off sharply since the early 2000s, as former President Hugo Chavez and then the Maduro administration tightened control over the state-run oil company, PDVSA, leading to an exodus of more experienced staff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though some Western oil firms, including the US company Chevron, are still active in the country, their operations have shrunk significantly as the US has widened sanctions and targeted oil exports, aiming to curb Maduro's access to a key economic lifeline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctions - which the US first put in place in 2015 during President Barack Obama's administration over alleged human rights violations - have also left the country largely cut off from the investment and the parts it needs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The real challenge they've got is their infrastructure,\" says Callum McPherson, head of commodities at Investec.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Venezuela produced an estimated 860,000 barrels per day, according to the latest oil market report from the International Energy Agency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is barely a third of what it was 10 years ago and accounts for less than 1% of world oil consumption.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Does Trump want Venezuela's oil?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the US have made the case for intervention in Venezuela by pointing to the opportunities for American businesses to revive the oil industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,\" Florida Republican congresswoman María Elvira Salazar <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6385537628112\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said</a> in a recent interview on Fox Business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"American companies can go in and fix all the oil pipes, the whole oil rigs and everything that has to do with... oil and the derivatives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump might seem open to such arguments. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He campaigned on the slogan \"drill, baby, drill\" and has generally called for expanding oil production, which he has tied to lower prices for Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Venezuela, the White House has said it is concerned about drug trafficking and what it sees as Maduro's illegitimacy.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coast</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked on Thursday whether the US campaign in the region was about drugs or oil, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was focused on \"many things\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She called stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the US its \"number one\" priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clayton Siegle, a senior fellow for energy security at the think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says he takes such pronouncements \"largely at face value\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed to the longstanding interest in the region of key players like Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just have not seen the supporting evidence that oil is at the centre of its ambitions,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What interests does US have in Venezuela?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's not to say that US companies would not be interested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, Chevron is the only American oil producer still active in Venezuela, after receiving a licence under former President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate, despite US sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year, though it has revoked exemptions for other firms, such as Spain's Repsol, in a bid to curb the flow of funds to the Maduro regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, Chevron accounts for about a fifth of Venezuela's oil production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say Chevron would be among those best-placed to benefit, should the US start to lift its barriers against dealing with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Refiners in the US, particularly those around the Gulf Coast, are also hungry for the \"heavier\" type of crude that Venezuela produces, which tends to be less expensive and therefore more profitable to process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been problematic for US Gulf Coast refiners in recent years that Venezuela has been under sanctions and been reducing production, because it means there's less of that heavy crude available,\" says Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if they weren't getting involved in the production side of things, they would be a keen buyer of it.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are the challenges?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While any expansion of oil exports from Venezuela could help bring down prices in the US, analysts say that would take time, with its current output too limited to make a significant impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And restoring Venezuela's oil industry to its former glory would be a heavy lift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a recent Wood Mackenzie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/what-could-change-in-venezuela-mean-for-oil-production/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report</a>, improved management and some modest investments could help boost oil production in Venezuela to about two million barrels per day over the next two years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But analysts warned it would take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to raise output more significantly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also said companies could be put off by potential complications like its membership in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

relatively less important as an energy source, says David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Oil demand is not going to fall off a cliff but it is no longer growing as it was. We see it as subdued and will start falling in the late 2030s,\" he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anyone investing in the Venezuelan oil sector would have to think, is it worth it?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if Maduro were ousted or US barriers were to lift, Mr Oxley says it is not clear how willing companies would be to commit the time and money it would take to bring Venezuela's oil back online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On the oil side, you'd need to see lots and lots of investment. Certainly in the billions,\"  he says, \"'Drill, baby, drill' - that's fine but private companies are only going to come in and do it if it's profitable.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the school</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They forcibly dragged me into the car.

You get severe bruising.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessions</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the hand</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Viral letters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Secret filming A group of eight students wearing dark T-shirts and black shorts stand to attention, facing away from the camera, on a running track. behind them is a cream-coloured building.

The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020.

The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult.

The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\".

The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November.

That's a major blow to the population,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,\" he said. \"If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An aerial shot of a mosque standing amid a sea of uprooted tea trunks\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Experts suggest that as much as 7,200 hectares of forest was destroyed in the recent cyclone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand.

They began demolishing buildings with explosives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was a striking change of heart. For years, Myanmar's military rulers turned a blind eye to the multi-billion dollar scam business expanding rapidly along its border with Thailand. Local warlords allied to the military have been the principal protectors and business partners of the Chinese scam bosses, and have become very rich. Some of that money went into the coffers of the ruling generals. The junta has tried to blame the KNU for the scams, but there is no basis for this; unlike the other armed Karen groups, the KNU has kept its distance from the business.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tha scam centres accessed the internet via Starlink</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24l5301gg8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Billions of dollars have been lost globally by victims of romance scams</a>, people duped into get-rich-quick crypto schemes and elderly people investing their retirement money into bogus funds, many of which originate from these centres. The darkest side of the industry is felt in South East Asia, where these online fraud schemes are linked to human trafficking, money laundering and extensive human rights abuses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is growing international concern, and co-ordination between law-enforcement agencies, to try to combat this scourge. The US has set up a multi-agency anti-scam task force. China, one of the Myanmar military junta's closest allies, has been pressing it to do more for years because <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq95j1yp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">thousands of Chinese citizens have fallen victim both to online fraud</a> and to being trafficked and held for ransom in the compounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the reports in Myanmar state media showcasing the military's actions in KK Park, it would appear that this pressure is finally working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet its demolitions in KK Park, while spectacular, do not appear to have destroyed the infrastructure for scamming there. And the military operations have focused only on this compound – there are dozens of others. It did raid the scam city of Shwe Kokko, but only entered a few buildings, and to date has demolished only one.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head A damaged building inside KK Park as seen from across the Thai-Myanmar border. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some buildings in KK park looked heavily damaged</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of foreign scam workers have left KK Park and Shwe Kokko, and made their way across the Moei River to Thailand. Many others have scattered to different locations, although transport is difficult and expensive. Just booking a car now costs 5,000 yuan, equivalent to about $700 (£520). The main scam bosses are presumed to have taken their businesses to more remote, less visible parts of Myanmar further south on the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a town called Minletpan, one group of scam workers was trapped last month in two compounds, known as Shunda and Baoili. These have been built right by the river just in the past two years. They are in an area controlled by the DKBA, one of the militias allied to the military junta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 21 November, according to a KNU spokesman, their fighters were engaged in a battle with the army, when they found themselves being shot at from behind by the DKBA in Minletpan. They turned and drove out the DKBA, but then found themselves unexpectedly in control of the two scam centres, and the thousands of foreigners working there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The KNU announced that it wanted to set an example by inviting journalists and international law enforcement agencies to see the captured compounds. It published photographs and documents to expose how the scam business works, rather than destroying the evidence as the military has done in KK Park.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sent hundreds of workers over the river to Thailand, but around 1,000, mainly Chinese citizens, refused to leave, probably because they feared prosecution if they went back to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But aside from a handful of journalists, the international interest in its prize never materialised, and the junta's forces began shelling the area to try to retake the compounds – that's what we could hear from the Thai side. Many of the remaining scam workers have now fled elsewhere in Myanmar, though a few hundred remain camped under flimsy tarpaulins on the river bank, along with hundreds of local people, all hoping to avoid the artillery exchanges.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head Clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dust rises above KK Park as buildings were demolished</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this drama is down to one thing: <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the junta's much criticised plan to hold an election later this month</a>. The civil war ignited by its coup is ravaging the country. The military regime is loathed by most of Myanmar's people, and is treated as a pariah internationally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The generals are looking for an off-ramp which will buy them a semblance of legitimacy, and win over some of their many opponents. They have chosen an election, but one in which the main opposition groups either cannot or will not take part, and where much of the country is in too much turmoil for voting to take place at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the military has made retaking as much territory from insurgents before the election a priority. It is also trying to clean up its image, by its high-profile operation against the scam compounds. This is especially important for its most powerful international ally, China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we were on the border, we saw clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished. Some of the largest structures there were buckled and bent, their windows shattered; the walls of others were being torn down by excavators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the distance many buildings were still intact. Some had tell-tale white squares on their roofs that were almost certainly Starlink satellite dishes, suggesting some scam work might still be going on there.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A warning against scammers is displayed at a Thai-Myanmar border crossing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Drive an hour-and-half south in Thailand, and you reach a quiet border crossing called Wa Le – Wawlay in Burmese. The river is so narrow here it is little more than a stream; you walk over to Myanmar through an iron gate and across a little blue wooden bridge, where you are greeted by the flags of the KNU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while the territory around Wawlay is fiercely contested, with the KNU capturing several military bases earlier this year, the crossing is controlled by the DKBA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the Thai side large signs warn people of the risks of being lured into working for scam centres. Yet just a few metres away a walled compound, topped with razor wire, has been built right next to the river. This is known as Hengsheng 3; we could hear generators running and security guards talking on the other side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were barred windows, and Starlink dishes on the roof. Monitoring groups have identified this and several other new compounds around Wawlay. Many more syndicates have moved even further south to Payathonzu, near the Three Pagodas Pass border crossing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whatever the future of well-known scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko – and it is too soon to judge whether they really are being shut down – the scam business is still thriving in Myanmar.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more about Myanmar's scam compounds</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

BBC Verify confirmed the ship was the Skipper by matching a sign seen in footage released by the US to a reference photo supplied by TankerTrackers.com, a site which monitors oil shipments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Data held by publicly accessible tracking sites paints an incomplete picture of the vessel's movements, and before its seizure it hadn't declared its position since 7 November. Maritime analytics firm Kpler also suggested that the vessel had engaged in a ship-to-ship transfer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Attorney General Pam Bondi <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1w9lg11jw0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">described the vessel as a \"crude oil tanker</a> used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Treasury department first sanctioned the ship in 2022, when it was sailing under the name Adisa, and was accused of being part of an \"international oil smuggling network\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper has sailed under the flag of Guyana, but the government was quick to release a statement saying that the 20-year-old tanker was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts told BBC Verify that the Skipper was likely a part of the so-called \"dark fleet\" - a global network of oil tankers that seek to evade oil sanctions by obscuring their ownership, identities and travel histories.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Hiding its position</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a UN treaty, all ships above a certain tonnage must have an onboard tracker called an Automatic Identification System (AIS). These trackers broadcast information about the ships, including their location, and can be followed on websites like MarineTraffic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is an incomplete and misleading public record of the Skipper's movements. According to MarineTraffic, the Skipper's last known port call was at Soroosh in Iran on 9 July, where it arrived after stopping in Iraq and the UAE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Kpler suggests that this is part of a pattern of misleading entries by the Skipper. Analysts at the firm said the ship had previously loaded crude oil from Venezuela and Iran, while falsifying its position via its onboard tracker, a process known as spoofing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has some of the world's largest reserves of oil, but <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47036491\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">exports were placed under sanctions</a> in 2019 by the US in a bid to force the transition of power from President Nicholas Maduro's administration, which has been widely accused of election rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The firm noted that while its AIS showed the ship at Iraq's Basrah Oil Terminal on 7 and 8 July, terminal reports showed no record of the vessel there. Instead, the Skipper loaded crude oil at Kharg Island in Iran, Kpler said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper then sailed east, tracking data shows, where Kpler suggested it conducted a ship-to-ship transfer between 11 and 13 August. The cargo was later unloaded in China, where Kpler said it was \"falsely declared\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It returned via Iran and sailed towards the Caribbean. The Skipper last declared its position on 7 November, several miles off the coast of Guyana. Its location only reappeared on 10 December, after the US raid.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the interim period, satellite images identified by TankerTrackers.com and confirmed by BBC Verify show that the Skipper was present in the Port of Jose in Venezuela on 18 November and not appearing on tracking sites at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the imposition of sanctions, analysts say it has become common for ships to spoof or conceal their positions while loading oil in Venezuela.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kpler analysts said the ship loaded \"at least 1.1 million barrels of Merey crude\" by 16 November at the terminal and listed Cuba as the destination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also evidence that the Skipper was involved in a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel on 7 December, just days before it was boarded by US troops. Satellite images seen by Kpler appeared to show the exchange, with one of the vessels identified by Kpler as the Skipper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The transfer took place just off the coast of Venezuela, near the city of Barcelona. According to MarineTraffic, the Skipper had last appeared off the coast of Guyana weeks earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kpler told BBC Verify that between 28 October and 4 December, the Skipper broadcasted \"manipulated\" AIS signals which did not reflect its actual location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such sanction evading activity is not unusual for Venezuelan oil exports, Kpler said. The company said that tankers often transfer their cargo off the coast of Malaysia, before the oil is imported into China.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Belgian naval lieutenant and analyst Frederik Van Lokeren told BBC Verify that while such ship-to-ship transfers are not illegal or wrong, they are \"extremely uncommon\". He said such activities were normally a sign of vessels trying to evade sanctions, transferring oil to ships not publicly associated with smuggling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Van Lokeren said that Venezuela's refining capacity has been significantly degraded in recent years and is \"dependent\" on its allies in Iran and Russia to convert its crude oil into more commercially lucrative products.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who owns the Skipper?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MarineTraffic lists the beneficial owner and operator as Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd and it lists the registered owner as Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, the US Treasury said that Triton was being used by a sanctioned Russian oil magnate - Viktor Artemov - to facilitate a global \"oil smuggling network\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, US officials said Mr Artemov used an expansive network of ships often registered obscurely to transport Iranian oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its statement, the US Treasury said that Triton had \"materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, Artemov\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify is attempting to contact both companies for comment. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

A grotesque, charred silhouette, reclining, with one knee raised, as if lounging on one of Marseille's nearby beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was 15 when he died, in the usual way: a bullet in the head, then petrol poured over his slim corpse and set on fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Someone even filmed the scene on the beach, the latest in a grim series of shoot-then-burn murders linked to this port city's fast-evolving drug wars, increasingly fuelled by social media and now marked by chillingly random acts of violence and by the growing role of children, often coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's chaos now,\" said a scrawny gang-member, lifting his shirt in a nearby park to show us a torso marked by the scars of at least four bullets - the result of an attempted assassination by a rival gang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France's Ministry of Justice estimates that the number of teenagers involved in the drugs trade has risen more than four-fold in the past eight years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've been in [a gang] since I was 15. But everything has changed now. The codes, the rules – there are no more rules. Nobody respects anything these days. The bosses start... to use youngsters. They pay them peanuts. And they end up killing others for no real reason. It's anarchy, all over town,\" said the man, now in his early 20s, who asked us to use his nickname, The Immortal.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Immortal, a Marseille gang member, showing his bullet wounds from a rival gang attack</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across Marseille, police, lawyers, politicians and community organisers talk of a <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> – a state of collective trauma or panic – gripping parts of the city, as they debate whether to fight back with ever tougher police action or with fresh attempts to address entrenched poverty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's an atmosphere of fear. It's obvious that the drug traffickers are dominant, and gaining more ground every day,\" said a local lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against her or her family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The rule of law is now subordinate to the gangs. Until we have a strong state again, we have to take precautions,\" she said, explaining her recent decision to stop representing victims of gang violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the summer, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3d1jdmg779o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">several French cities imposed night-time curfews</a> on teenagers after a spate of violence linked to drug trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Emmanuel Macron was holding talks on Thursday in an attempt to respond to the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's so much competition in the drugs trade that... people are ready to do anything,\" said community organiser Mohamed Benmeddour. \"So, we have kids aged 13 or 14 who come in as lookouts or dealers. The young see dead bodies, they hear about it, every day. And they're no longer afraid of killing, or being killed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trigger for Marseille's current <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> was the murder, last month, of Mehdi Kessaci, a 20-year-old trainee policeman with no links to the drug trade. It is widely believed his death was intended as a warning to his brother, a prominent 22-year-old anti-gang activist and aspiring politician named Amine Kessaci.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under close police protection now, Kessaci spoke to the BBC about Mehdi's death, and the guilt he feels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Should I have made my family leave [Marseille]? The struggle of my life is going to be this fight against guilt,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/01b3/live/0b5f2440-d442-11f0-8642-e5058b210012.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images French anti-drug activist Amine Kessaci (C) and his mother Ouassila Benhamdi Kessaci (L) gather to take part in a march in tribute to Mehdi Kessaci at the roundabout where he was murdered and to protest against drug trafficking, in Marseille, southern France on November 22, 2025. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">French anti-drug activist Amine Kessaci (centre) is mourning his brother Mehdi, who was murdered in Marseille</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amine Kessaci first rose to national prominence in 2020, after his older brother, a gang member named Brahim, was also murdered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had this <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> for years. We've known that our lives are hanging by a single thread. But everything changed since Covid. The perpetrators are getting younger and younger. The victims are younger and younger,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My little brother was an innocent victim. There was a time when the real thugs... had a moral code. You don't kill in daytime. Not in front of everyone. You don't burn bodies. First you threaten with a shot to the leg... Today these steps have all disappeared.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Citing today's \"unprecedented\" levels of violence, French police are responding with what they call security \"bombardments\" in high-crime areas of Marseille.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although one gang, the DZ Mafia, now appears to dominate the trade, it operates a kind of franchise system, with a fractious network of small distributors often staffed by teenagers and undocumented immigrants, who clash violently over territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to one estimate, up to 20,000 people may be involved in the city's drug industry. Last year officials confiscated €42m (£36m) in criminal assets from the gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video footage shared on social media routinely shows gang members, armed with automatic rifles, shooting at each other in Marseille's various <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i> – poor neighbourhoods characterised by high-rise buildings and a concentration of social housing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold afternoon last week, we accompanied a group of armed riot police on one of their regular \"bombardment\" missions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers sped up to a dilapidated block of flats in their vans as a youthful gang look-out on the gate promptly fled on foot. Splitting into two groups, the police ran up either side of the building seeking to catch dealers in the stairwells.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The aim is to disrupt the drug dealing spots. We've closed more than 40 of them... and we've locked up a lot of people,\" explained Sébastien Lautard, a regional police chief.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC films arrests in Marseille drug raid</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Turn him round,\" said an officer, brusquely, as his team pinned an 18-year-old up against a door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a filthy cellar nearby, the police found dozens of vials and tiny plastic bags used to distribute cocaine. Later, a policeman explained that the young man they had detained was pleading to be arrested, saying he had come to Marseille from another city, and was now being held against his will and forced to work for a drug gang. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers took him away in a van.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not El Dorado. We have a lot of youngsters recruited on social media. They come to Marseille thinking they'll make easy money. They're promised €200 ($233;£175) a day. But it often ends in misery, violence and sometimes death,\" said the city's chief prosecutor, Nicolas Bessone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his office close to the city's old harbour, Bessone described an industry thought to be worth up to €7bn nationwide and characterised by two new developments: a growing emphasis on online recruitment, sales, and delivery; and a rising number of teenagers coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We now see how the traffickers enslave these... little soldiers. They create fictional debts to make them work for free. They torture them if they steal €20 to buy a sandwich. It's ultra-violence. The average age of the perpetrators and victims is getting younger and younger,\" said Bessone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He urged local people not to succumb to a <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> but instead to \"react, to rise up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawyer who asked us to hide her identity described a case she had handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One young person, who absolutely didn't want to be part of a network, was picked up after school, forced to participate in the drugs trade, was raped, then threatened, then his family also threatened. All means are used to create a workforce,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tiktok, dozens of videos, set to music, advertise drugs for sale in Marseille's <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i>, \"from 10:00 to midnight\", each product with its own emoji, for cocaine, hashish and marijuana. Other adverts seek to recruit new gang members with messages like \"recruiting a worker\", \"€250 for lookouts\", \"€500 to carry drugs\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For some local politicians, the answer to Marseille's troubles is a state of emergency, and far tougher rules on immigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Authority must be restored. We need to end a culture of permissiveness in our country. We need to give more freedom, more power to the police and the judiciary,\" said Franck Alissio, a local MP for the populist, far-right National Rally party, and a prospective mayoral candidate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the ancient Mediterranean city of Marseille has, for centuries, been known for its large immigrant community, Alissio argued that \"today, the problem is that we are no longer able to integrate economically and assimilate. Too much immigration. It's the number [of immigrants] that's the problem. And in fact, the drug traffickers, dealers, lookouts, the leaders of these mafia, are almost all immigrants or foreigners with dual nationality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a controversial claim that is hard to verify in a country that strives to avoid including such details in official figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alissio claimed that billions of euros had been poured into Marseille's poorest neighborhoods by successive governments to no effect. He blamed parents and schools for allowing children into the drugs trade but added that he was focused on \"solving the problem, not doing sociology\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right parties have long enjoyed strong support across the south of France, but less so in the diverse city of Marseille itself. Critics of the RN, like the lawyer whose identity we have concealed, accused the party of \"exploiting misery and fear,\" and wrongly blaming immigrants for a \"gangrene\" that is widespread across all communities in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Philippe Pujol, a local writer and expert on the drug trade in Marseille, was also offered police protection after the murder of Mehdi Kessaci last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not sure if there's a good reason for this terror. But... terror is taking hold. I would rather be afraid and careful than take unnecessary risks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he hit back against calls for tougher police action, arguing it was merely nursing the symptoms \"of a suffering society\", rather than treating the causes of the problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Describing entrenched poverty as a \"monster,\" Pujol painted a picture of a society radicalised by decades of neglect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The monster is a mixture of patronage, corruption, and political and economic decisions made against the public interest,\" Pujol said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These kids can be jerks when they're in a group, but when you're alone with them, they're still children, with dreams, who don't want this violence.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It hovers as camouflaged soldiers holding rifles swing down ropes to the vessel's deck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The video, released by the US government, shows the latest in a series of escalations in Washington's pressure campaign on Nicolás Maduro's government – the seizure of a crude oil tanker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US claims the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran in an \"illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil has called the seizure \"international piracy\" and claims US President Donald Trump wants Venezuela's energy resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's what we know.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The operation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela - a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The footage of the operation was shared by Attorney General Pam Bondi on social media. Bondi said a seizure warrant for the tanker was carried out by the US Coast Guard, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the Pentagon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exact location of the tanker at the time of the seizure is not clear, but a senior military official told BBC's US partner CBS News that the vessel had just left a port in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 45-second video shows a US team walking the deck of the ship with their weapons drawn. No ship crew are visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seizure involved two helicopters, 10 marines and 10 US Coast Guard members, and special operations forces, a source familiar with the operation told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boarding of the vessel involved an elite group of the Coast Guard called the Maritime Security and Response Team, the source said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This team is trained in counterterrorism and high-risk law enforcement boarding procedures – like the fast-rope boarding from a helicopter seen in the video. It was created after the September 11 attacks, during an overhaul of national security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Coast Guard led the operation with support from the Navy, officials told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Victor Hansen, a former military lawyer and law professor at New England Law in Boston, said that the Trump administration has \"not been really clear in articulating a legal justification\" for the seizure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't seem to be relying on a military justification, unlike the targeting of the [drug] boats,\" he added. \"This seems more related to violating sanctions imposed on both Venezuela and Iran.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Mr Hansen, military operations including \"visit, board, search and seizure\" missions at sea always include both \"formal and off-the-cuff\" inputs from military lawyers both before and during the operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But they have no command authority to approve or refuse an operation,\" he added. \"What they do is advise commanders on the legalities, risks and rewards.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if the Venezuelan seizure was carried out by non-military law enforcement units such as those from the Coast Guard, \"there are lawyers that would serve similar roles.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hansen also noted that while ship boarding missions have taken place in the past - such as in the Persian Gulf or Arabian Sea - the recent incident is distinct in that the ship was seized in addition to its cargo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's not something that has been done in the recent past,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Planet Labs PBC An overhead view of two oil tankers at sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Planet Labs PBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Skipper (the vessel on the right) was filmed by satellite on 18 November at the José Terminal, a facility in Barcelona, Venezuela, which is used by crude oil tankers</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The oil tanker</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vanguard Tech said the vessel was \"reported to be part of the dark fleet, and was sanctioned by the United States for carrying Venezuelan oil exports\". The dark fleet refers to ships used to smuggle sanctioned goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have left the oil port of Jose on either 4 or 5 December, with about 1.8 million barrels of heavy crude oil on board, with about 200,000 barrels transferred to another vessel before the seizure, Reuters reported, citing analysis from TankerTrackers.com and the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify located the tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows that the vessel was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days prior to the seizure. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MarineTraffic shows it was last near Iran in mid-September before arriving off the coast of Guyana at the end of October and making minimal further movement since then. This data may be partial or incorrect because of spoofing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The seized oil</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil carried by the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global crude oil prices are trading at roughly $61 (£46) a barrel, meaning the stash aboard the Skipper could be worth more than $95m - if it does indeed comprise 1.6m barrels after 200,000 were removed. The BBC has not verified how much oil is on board the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi, the top prosecutor in the US, said of the seized vessel: \"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has accused the US of using its ongoing military buildup in the Caribbean and \"war on drugs\" to try and depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil - something the US denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela sits on the largest known reserves of crude oil in the world. But analysts have highlighted complexities. The oil is considered \"heavy\" and highly viscous, meaning that extracting it needs special equipment and knowledge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has also had difficulties exporting its vast resources because of ageing infrastructure and heavy sanctions from the US.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The world's largest warship - the USS Gerald Ford - was used as a staging post for Wednesday's tanker seizure</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The wider US pressure campaign</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has focused for much of the last year on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the effort, Trump designated two Venezuelan criminal groups - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations and has alleged that the latter is led by Maduro himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without providing evidence, Trump has also accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US. Stopping immigration has been another priority for the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the pressure campaign, the US has deployed 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships to the Caribbean. Among them is the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald Ford - from which helicopters took off as part of the tanker seizure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mick Mulroy, a former Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy under secretary of defence at the Pentagon, told the BBC that the seizure of the tanker will \"amp up pressure\" on the Venezuelan government amid the broader campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuela has a considerable amount of oil reserves,\" he said. \"Seizing a tanker transporting oil or a tanker carrying the chemicals needed to pump the crude oil out of the ground sends a message, specifically if this is just the beginning of a campaign.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since early September, US forces have carried out more than 20 strikes in international waters on boats alleged to have been carrying drugs. More than 80 people have been killed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration argues that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers, whom it accuses of conducting irregular warfare against the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also described those on board as \"narco terrorists\" but legal experts say the strikes are unlawful as that designation \"did not transform them into lawful military targets\".</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"
