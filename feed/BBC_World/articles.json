Any area that Ukrainian troops pulled out of would have to be policed by Ukraine, he stressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk.

She asked an appeals court to order that Combs be resentenced, should the panel choose not to throw out his conviction in its entirety. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The request is the latest attempt by his team to reduce his sentence or throw out his conviction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Southern District of New York, which prosecuted Combs, declined to comment on the request to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Combs' lawyers had previously said they would appeal his sentence and conviction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal prosecutors in New York accused Combs of using his money, power, and the threat of violence to coerce women into unwanted sexual encounters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a high-profile trial this spring, the jury heard from two of Combs' ex-girlfriends, Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified as \"Jane Doe\". They said Combs abused them and forced them to participate in so-called \"freak-offs\" with male escorts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The jury found Combs not guilty of the two most serious charges: racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. They convicted him of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, after his conviction, Combs asked Judge Arun Subramanian to consider an acquittal or new trial, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80g93ryklno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">citing objections over the way an anti-prostitution statute known as the Mann Act </a>was used to prosecute Combs. That bid was not successful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of his sentencing, Combs' attorneys argued he should receive a brief sentence that would essentially amount to time served, a request that would have paved the way for a swift release. Prosecutors, however, asked the judge to send Combs to prison for at least 11 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US District Judge Arun Subramanian ultimately sentenced Combs to more than four years in prison. He said he considered Combs' contributions to society and testimonials from family and friends, but \"a history of good works can't wash away your record\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Combs' appeal argues that Judge Subramanian did not properly follow sentencing guidelines when sending him to 50-months in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It argues the judge \"flouted\" new guidelines and improperly considered conduct for which Combs had been acquitted when formulating his punishment. The filing argues the judge \"acted as a thirteenth juror\" in the case and calls the sentence \"draconian\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Judge Subramanian issued his sentence, Combs apologized to Ms Ventura and \"Jane.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick,\" Combs said. \"I got lost in excess, I got lost in my ego.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Combs is also facing dozens of pending civil lawsuits, which accuse him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation. Many of the lawsuits allege that the rapper used his fame and power to silence accusers through threats. Some detail allegations that the rapper - or those who worked for him - drugged people at parties before alleged assaults. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representatives for Mr Combs have repeatedly said he \"never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

The DoJ has been under scrutiny after not releasing all Epstein files by 19 December, the deadline mandated under a new law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency said it would \"continue to fully comply with federal law and President Trump's direction to release the files\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement did not specify how the FBI and the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York came across the additional material. Epstein had been facing charges of sex trafficking minors in the state when he died awaiting trial in a New York prison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news comes after the justice department released thousands of documents - some heavily redacted - related to their investigations into Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The department has been releasing the documents in batches and top officials have said hundreds of thousands of documents still are to be released. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The files were released after Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act - signed into law by US President Donald Trump - that ordered the agency to share all the documents with the public while protecting victims' identities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the released documents, which include videos, photos, emails and investigative documents, have heavy redactions, including names of people the FBI appears to cite as possible co-conspirators in the Epstein case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The justice department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the amount of redactions, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X after the discovery of the additional documents was announced, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, a congressional panel that has been investigating the Epstein saga, accused the White House of “illegally” withholding the files.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“Every day we see lies, incompetence, missed deadlines, and illegal redactions,” Representative Robert Garcia said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Included in the documents are emails appearing to be exchanged between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yj4yvx80do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the justice department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous releases of Epstein documents have included revelations that reverberated across the Atlantic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4q61y399xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Peter Mandelson</a> was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US after details emerged about his friendship with the convicted paedophile, and that he told Epstein \"I think the world of you\", the day before Epstein began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lord Mandelson said in a letter to staff that \"I deeply regret\" the circumstances of his departure from the British embassy in Washington DC. He said being ambassador had been \"the privilege of my life\" and he continued \"to feel utterly awful about my association with Epstein twenty years ago and the plight of his victims\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cewjrvn5795o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor</a> lost his prince title and was asked to leave his Windsor mansion, Royal Lodge, following prolonged scrutiny over his links to Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the latest release of files on Tuesday, a 2001 email sent by a person identified as \"A\" from \"Balmoral\" to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell - who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences- asks: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Andrew's team for a response.

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. The BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm28g5exx09o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">person identified as \"A\"</a> stands out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar, email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted his team for a response.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">FBI email suggests 10 possible 'co-conspirators'</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Justice An undated photo released by the US justice department shows Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell seated close together outside a wooden home, appearing to be a cabin of some kind in a wooded area\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Justice</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The name of Ghislaine Maxwell (R) is one of two names not redacted on an FBI list</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">DoJ says alleged Epstein letter to Nassar is fake</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Larry Nassar from the shoulders up, wearing square framed glasses with wire rims and orange jumpsuit, looks off to his left\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Larry Nassar</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter included in the released batch of documents has gained plenty of attention online. But, according to the DoJ, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home.

Trump was also \"listed as having traveled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was previously married to Marla Maples, Tiffany's mother, from 1993 to 1999.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor also wrote that \"on one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old\", with the third passenger's name redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The timing of Trump's alleged trips coincide with the years that were examined by federal prosecutors for Maxwell's conduct and travels as part of the criminal case they brought against her.

But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage Rupert Murdoch (R) and daughter Elisabeth Murdoch attend the Cheltenham Festival \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'James and Rupert will never patch up differences'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable.

Driven by fears over the more liberal direction they might want the companies to take after his death, the media mogul tried to change the terms of a trust that gave his four oldest children equal control when he dies.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c15/live/dcf38460-dc26-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images (L-R) James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch from 1987\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father Rupert and older brother Lachlan now appears irreconcilable (L-R, James Murdoch, Anna Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch and Lachlan Murdoch)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lachlan, who Rupert had already chosen to run the business, is now - definitively - the only one who will take the reins after his father's demise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lachlan and Rupert Murdoch actually lost the first round of their court fight.

They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years.

They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute. That figure is around 30% for Hispanics, who are 37% of the US Catholic population.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8d56/live/8d045590-d9a8-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US Vice President JD Vance speaks during the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast at the Walter E.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect.

Parliament in Cape Town set up its own panel to investigate the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As I see it now, this is terrorism,\" Gen Mkhwanazi said appearing as the Madlanga Commission's first witness in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are \"people who want to take over government, not through the ballot paper but through these criminal activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the three months of testimony from the parallel inquiries, South Africans have heard about an alleged drug cartel with political connections and a businessman, who is awaiting trial for attempted murder, with alleged ties to leading government figures. A witness at the Madlanga Commission was also murdered after giving evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's what we've learned so far:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Role of the 'Big Five Cartel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most explosive evidence was the testimony given by police crime intelligence boss Lt-Gen Dumisani Khumalo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing before the Madlanga Commission within the first month of hearings, Lt-Gen Khumalo alleged there was a drug trafficking cartel, headed by individuals who he called the Big Five, operating in several provinces, which had \"penetrated the political sphere\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He named two figures from the five alleged leaders of this criminal gang, one of them being controversial businessman Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala is currently facing 25 criminal charges, among them attempted murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These stem from three separate incidents that occurred between 2022 and 2024. He has denied all the charges against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crime intelligence boss claimed the Big Five led a network with widespread influence across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He alleged that it was a cartel, that was operating both locally and abroad, and dealt mainly with narcotics but also carried out contract killings \"associated with the drug trafficking processes\", cross-border hijackings and kidnappings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This cartel had tentacles within the country's criminal justice system, and this allowed them to \"manipulate investigations, suppress evidence [and] obstruct legal proceedings that threaten their activities\", Lt-Gen Khumalo added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was this grouping that was allegedly behind the disbandment of the political killings task team (PKTT), which was working mainly in Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is because the cartel \"mistakenly thought the PKTT was investigating\" them, Lt-Gen Khumalo told the commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Big Five has already penetrated the political sphere and there are documented cases of high-profile connections in the political arena,\" the policeman alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another witness at the Madlanga Commission had been part of the PKTT. Anonymised – and known only as \"witness C\" - he also mentioned what he called the Big Five cartel, alleging it had \"full control and oversight\" in every government department.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is 'Cat' Matlala?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/461d/live/deeb4bd0-de8e-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gallo Images via Getty Images A composite of four head-and-shoulders photographs of Vusimusi Cat Matlala as he was giving evidence to the parliamentary inquiry showing him giving different hand gestures.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gallo Images via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vusimusi \"Cat\" Matlala spent two days giving testimony at the parliamentary inquiry</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Central to the allegations against the suspended police minister is his alleged close relationship with \"Cat\" Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Madlanga Commission, Mkhwanazi repeated claims he had made at a press conference in July that Mchunu was indirectly receiving financial support from the businessman to fund his \"political endeavours\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He shared copies of text messages and a payment allegedly made by Matlala to prove this at the time. These payments were seemingly facilitated by a third party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his appearance at the Madlanga Commission Mchunu refuted the allegations saying that he had \"never been accused of corruption, not once\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the first time I get accused of such.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala had a lucrative contract with the police before it was abruptly cancelled when he was charged for attempted murder in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2001, he was convicted and served time for the possession of stolen goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he would be arrested for a string of alleged crimes, including house robberies, a cash-in-transit heist and assault, but in all cases he denied involvement and was either acquitted or had the charges withdrawn against him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing at the parliamentary inquiry, Mr Matlala said he had turned his life around in 2017, when he \"formally registered my first business which was a security business\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he is now in custody over the attempted murder charge, he gave evidence with restraints around his ankles. Over the course of his two-day testimony in front of MPs Mr Matlala laid bare his description of relationships with former and current ministers as well as top police officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apart from being accused of having close ties to Mchunu, Mr Matlala has been linked to others in the police force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He denied knowing the senior police officers and politicians personally but admitted making payments for ANC-related activities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"From what I understand, the minister [Mchunu] sent [a third party] to go ask for donations there and there, and I was one of them,\" Mr Matlala told MPs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also told the parliamentary panel that after the authorities had returned firearms seized from him, former Police Minister Bheki Cele had demanded \"a facilitation fee\" of 1m rand ($60,000; £45,000) to which he only paid half the amount. Mr Matlala alleged that Cele also allegedly asked for this money to stop harassment from the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cele, who testified before Mr Matlala's appearance at the parliamentary committee, admitted to MPs that he had known Mr Matlala for a couple of months and had stayed at his penthouse on two occasions as these were \"freebies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He, however, denied receiving money from Mr Matlala.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Matlala has not yet appeared at the Madlanga Commission but is expected to have a chance to speak there at some point next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various witnesses, however, painted a different picture of Mr Matlala's relationship with the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness C told the Madlanga Commission that Mr Matlala had \"close relationships with senior [police] officials\" and had detailed the extent of this after police arrested him back in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The witness alleged that Mr Matlala contributed money towards the now-suspended police minister's presidential ambitions within the ANC even though he did not believe he would win.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Commission witness later murdered</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness at the Madlanga Commission was murdered in early December, just three weeks after he gave testimony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear if the two events were connected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marius van der Merwe, who was identified only as \"Witness D\" during his appearance, was killed in full view of his family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had just returned home in the evening and was gunned down as he waited for the front gate to open. No arrests have been made but three people of interest have been identified by police. The motive for the shooting is unclear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The identity of Mr Van der Merwe, a former police officer who ran a private security company, was confirmed by authorities after his murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his appearance in front of Judge Madlanga he had implicated officials, including Brig Julius Mkhwanazi (no relation to Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi) who was acting police chief for an area including parts of Johannesburg.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc71/live/d8e1a060-da8b-11f0-b800-5d5b12ef9423.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gallo via Getty Images A head and shoulders image of Mbuyiseli Madlanga listening to the testimony at the commission.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gallo via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Retired Judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga will chair further sessions in the new year and will then submit a final report</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There he had claimed Brig Mkhwanazi ordered him to get rid of the body of a man accused of robbery who had allegedly been tortured and killed by police officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commenting on this, Mr Van der Merwe told the commission: \"I really did not have a chance to agree.

It is not clear how long the parliamentary inquiry will run but it too is expected to resume hearings in 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africans will now have to wait until some point next year to read the findings and recommendations from both inquiries.
