Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday.

They'll come to your house and take you into the bush,\" one of them told the BBC.  For his safety, the BBC is not identifying him and is calling him Aliyu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His young son is one of more 300 students abducted when armed men stormed the grounds of St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri village in the central state of Niger in the early hours of 21 November. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the children taken are as young as five years old. About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide. We know where they are, but we can't go there ourselves, it's too dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is desperate with worry - especially as vulnerable captives kept in forest hideouts have died during previous abductions, whether from sickness or because ransoms have not been paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel so bitter and my wife hasn't eaten for days...

The gangs are largely composed of ethnic Fulani people, who are traditionally nomadic herders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No details have been released about whether a ransom was paid to free the girls from Maga.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, it is illegal to pay ransoms in Nigeria. However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Katsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open. In addition, the community requested a guarantee that they would not be attacked and that bandits would not enter the community with guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the bandits in Jibia, they requested access to clean drinking water and safe passage for their cattle as they moved to new grazing pastures. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also requested that their women be allowed to buy and trade in local markets.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP/Getty Images A Fulani man in silhouette in northern Nigeria tending cattle with long horns.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Cows are prized possessions for ethnic Fulanis, who walk for hundreds of miles to find pasture for them</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High on the agenda - for both sides - was the release of those kidnapped. The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Audu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Access to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult. It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life had become expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-chris-ewokor-in-abuja\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetuses</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"I know my limits.

While some branches have reopened since a ceasefire took effect seven weeks ago, there are still no working ATMs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But people need cash to buy food and essentials. That has forced them to turn to informal money merchants who charge enormous commissions to turn digital transfers into cash. It has also sparked a huge increase in the use of e-wallets and money transfer apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it means that every existing banknote matters more than ever - no matter how tattered. That's where Baraa comes in. \"My tools are simple: a ruler, pencils, coloured pencils and glue,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ceasefire hasn't changed the financial situation.

For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">E-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme. Since early last year, Unicef says it has been able to make cash transfers to about a million people - half of them children. It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef. She used it to buy basics like rice, lentils and pasta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says: \"My children need vegetables, fruits, meat and eggs. My youngest son especially craves eggs, but I can't get them as prices are still so high and I have to cover the needs of 12 people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan promises an \"economic development plan to rebuild and energise Gaza\", convening \"a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities of the Middle East\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It envisages new investments and \"exciting development ideas\" that can \"create jobs, opportunity and hope for future Gaza\".

This is very typical.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as for the pop tunes blaring out of the speakers in Birmingham - like The Power of Love - you probably wouldn't hear that at markets in Germany - rather it would be Christmas music and carols, she says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nina Adler and Till Rampe were impressed by what they saw in Birmingham</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also visiting the market with us is Katharina Karcher, an academic at the University of Birmingham.

In Charlottenburg Palace in the west of the German capital, the market is bustling and filled with people of all ages when we visit on a Tuesday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The smell of roasted almonds, caramelised apples, chocolate-coated fruit, mulled wine and grilled sausages fills the air, as Christmas carols are performed live on a stage and children enjoy a small, sparkling Ferris wheel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 17th Century Baroque Charlottenburg Palace is illuminated in different colours, with falling snowflakes projected onto its facade and wooden stalls in front.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what exactly makes a traditional German Christmas market?</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Christmas market we visited in Berlin used projections as well as fairy lights</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Typically, they may have (as this one in Berlin does):</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Large tents housing entire restaurants or bars</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Stalls selling a range of handmade gifts, including woolly hats, gloves, scarves, jewellery, handmade candles, wooden nutcrackers and other arts and crafts</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Traditional German foods like Lebkuchen, the German version of gingerbread often seen in cookie form, many kinds of sausages including Bratwurst, cheeses, hearty dishes like Langos (a deep-fried Hungarian flatbread with different savoury or sweet toppings) or goulash, and Spätzle</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Mulled wine for those who drink alcohol, not so much beer</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">A location in a square in the Altstadt, the old part of a town.

Smaller markets, typically in historic settings, are also proving popular on TikTok, sometimes incredibly so. Since 2023, Lincoln Christmas market has been closed because of overcrowding concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC visited the market in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, earlier this week, we saw an open mic night, including a rendition of Neil Young's Heart of Gold, and stalls selling the likes of pasta, Greek gyros and Yorkshire pudding wraps.

Some people told us they'd prefer it if UK-based Christmas markets like in Kingston's sold more small gifts from independent businesses, like German markets do.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Amelia Shannon (second from left) came to Kingston Christmas market with her friends, all drama students</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anne-Teresa Markovic, an academic originally from Nuremberg, says she was struck  by the range of food and drink offerings being \"more prominent\" there than in Germany while visiting Christmas markets in Manchester and Leeds.
