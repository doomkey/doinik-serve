What land was to be swapped? Was Ukraine to be offered part of Russia, in exchange for the land Russia had taken by force?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Volodymyr Zelensky prepares to travel to Washington on Monday to meet Trump, there is likely no \"swap\" element to the US president's thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead, he is reportedly planning to press Zelensky to surrender the entirety of the eastern Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in return for Russia freezing the rest of the front line – a proposal put forward by Putin in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Luhansk is already almost entirely under Russian control. But Ukraine is estimated to have held onto about 30% of Donetsk, including several key cities and fortifications, at a cost of tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both regions – known together as Donbas – are rich in minerals and industry. To surrender them to Russia now would be a \"tragedy\", said the Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Hrytsak.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is Ukrainian territory,\" Mr Hrytsak said. \"And the people of these regions – particularly the miners – played a huge role in the strengthening of the Ukrainian identity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The region had also produced \"famous politicians, poets and dissidents\", he said. \"And now refugees who will not be able to return home if it becomes Russian.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 1.5 million Ukrainians have fled the Donbas since Russian aggression began in 2014. More than three million are estimated to be living under Russian occupation. A further 300,000 are estimated to be in the parts where Ukraine still has control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In areas closest to the front line, life is already a dangerous struggle. Andriy Borylo, a 55-year-old military chaplain in the badly hit city of Sloviansk, said in a phone interview that shells had landed next to his house over the weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is a very difficult situation here,\" he said. \"There is a feeling of resignation and abandonment. I don't know how much we have the strength to endure. Someone has to protect us. But who?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Borylo had been following the news from Alaska, he said. \"I put this on Trump, not Zelensky. But they are taking everything from me, and it is a betrayal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky has consistently said Ukraine would not hand over the Donbas in exchange for peace. And confidence in Russia to abide by any such arrangement – rather than simply use the annexed land for future attacks – is low.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For that and other reasons, about 75% of Ukrainians object to any formal cessation of land to Russia, according to polling by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6212/live/d47216d0-7b8c-11f0-9835-7fcb9fda4fa6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Residents step out of their car to take in the devastation of residential buildings bombed by Russian forces on August 10, 2025 in Kramatorsk, Ukraine\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Ukraine is estimated to have held onto about 30% of the Donetsk region, including several key cities and fortifications</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Ukraine is also deeply fatigued by war. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been killed and wounded since the full-scale invasion began. People are craving an end to suffering, particularly in the Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You ask about the surrender of the Donetsk region, well, I measure this war not in kilometres but in human lives,\" said Yevhen Tkachov, 56, an emergency rescue worker in the Donetsk city of Kramatorsk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm not ready to give tens of thousands of lives for several thousand square kilometres,\" he said. \"Life is more important than territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For some, this is what it comes down to in the end. Land versus life. It leaves President Zelensky \"at a crossroads with no good route in front of him\", said Volodmyr Ariev, a Ukrainian MP from the opposition European Solidarity party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't have enough forces to continue the war for an unlimited time,\" Ariev said. \"But if Zelensky were to concede this land it would be not only a breakdown of our constitution, it could have the hallmarks of treason.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, it is not clear in Ukraine by what mechanism such an agreement could even be reached. Any formal handover of the nation's territory requires the approval of the parliament and a referendum of the people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More likely would be a de-facto surrender of control, with no formal recognition of the territory as Russian. But even in that event, the process is not well understood, said Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no real understanding as to what the procedure should be,\" she said. \"Does the president simply sign the agreement? Does it have to be the government? The parliament?

Prosecutors contest this claim, and cited occasions when she travelled alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US attorney Michael Simpson said their relationship did not constitute a crime, but reflected \"a years-long fraud scheme that used public money for personal ends by exploiting their power and their authority\", according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At an undisclosed point in their relationship, a member of the public took photos of Cantrell and Mr Vappie dining together while the latter was said to be on duty. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cantrell filed a police report and sought a restraining order against the individual, prosecutors claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two are also accused of intimidating subordinates, lying to FBI agents and committing perjury by making false statements to a grand jury - which decide whether charges should be brought in certain cases in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If found guilty, any of the charges could bring multi-year prison sentences and fines of up to $250,000 (£184,000).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cantrell, a Democrat, is the first female mayor of New Orleans in the city's 300-year  history, having served since 2018.

It's hard to miss the evidence: huge, bright ads of chilli-laced dishes and, sometimes, Chinese idioms, in malls, buses and subway stations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From established chains to mom-and-pop stores and chic restaurants that challenge tired stereotypes, they have all been taking off here before leapfrogging further afield, to elsewhere in South East Asia and then across the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Succeeding in Singapore is \"a proof of concept for later expansion, convincing potential investors that the chain is ready to go global,\" says Thomas DuBois, a historian of modern China.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Singapore's Liang Seah Street is chock-a-block with Chinese food</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's an easy enough place for new restaurants to set up shop. And it is diverse, which makes it a great test kitchen for very different palates, from South Asian to European.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And importantly, Singapore is a travel hub where, Mr Dubois says, eating is almost like a national pastime: \"People go to Singapore to eat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And what they will find is menus that go beyond the ubiquitous dumplings and hot pot. The entrepreneurs behind the new Chinese culinary wave want to show people just how vast and diverse China is. And they cannot fake it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the visitors to Singapore are ethnic Chinese – not just from China, but from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Jakarta and so on – with a sophisticated understanding of Chinese cuisine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no one kind of fiery, says Claire Wang, the marketing manager for Nong Geng Ji, a chain from Hunan in central China, which is famous for its spicy dishes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hunan's fare has \"a tangy aftertaste achieved through fermented chilli peppers\", she says, unlike \"Sichuan's numbing-spicy or Guizhou's sour-spicy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After launching more than 100 restaurants in China, Nong Geng Ji opened its first overseas stop in Singapore in late 2023. It has since set up six more here, five in Malaysia, one in Canada, and is now eyeing opportunities in Thailand, Japan, South Korea and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's certainly proof of the growing appetite for chillies, especially the Chinese kind – a trend that would please China's former leader Mao Zedong. Born and raised in Hunan, he believed, \"You can't be a revolutionary if you don't eat chillies\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Finally, 'proper' Chinese food</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the less revolutionary among us, there is plenty more on the table: steamed buns, red meats, preserved vegetables, rice, seasonal stir-fries and delicately-flavoured seafood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's quite the spread compared to the \"Chinese food\" much of the world has become used to, especially in the West – food cooked up by Chinese immigrants in the 19th and 20th Centuries, whose scrubby, nondescript restaurants were often seen as low-brow.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0069/live/0c2037f0-7427-11f0-ab85-c1ec8d2f110b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A crowded street of restaurants and bars in New York City's Chinatown.

Ms Dunlop, a British food writer, has spent her career cooking in China's kitchens and studying its food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there is the stereotype, dubbed the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome, a partly xenophobic myth that the food can make people feel sick because of supposedly high concentration of additives, particularly the flavouring agent MSG. New research suggests MSG does not make you sick, and while older Chinese restaurants probably used shortcuts to flavour, they were hardly unique in using additives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, a growing diaspora is making it possible for Chinese restaurants to stay true to their roots, knowing they have customers demanding \"proper Chinese food\". And that has coincided with more adventurous palates in the world's biggest cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Thomas Tao was a student in New York in the 2010s, he says he rarely came across Chinese fine-dining, but Americans were very willing to pay for, say, Japanese sashimi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now he is the vice-president of the Green Tea Restaurant chain, which has more than 400 outlets in China serving fresh seafood and savoury soups from Zhejiang. It will open its first outpost in Singapore later this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it goes beyond food, with \"immersive\" restaurants.

Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">type 2 diabetes</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

This low fluctuation glycemic response could be beneficial to the body in the long run, researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mangoes are a much-loved fruit and maligned for its possible glucose and weight-elevating effects,\" said Dr Sugandha Kehar, first author of both studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These studies show that within prescribed diets, consumption of mangoes are not detrimental to blood glucose and may even be beneficial.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A second, eight-week randomised trial published in the Journal of Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Disorders - conducted at Delhi's Fortis C-DOC with Indian Council of Medical Research funding - has reinforced the findings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thirty-five adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C test (HbA1c) which measures average blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference and HDL cholesterol.

The fruit is, at once, a favourite indulgence and a quietly powerful social currency. \"Most Indians have a personal favourite mango and parochial regional loyalties have long fuelled heated ranking debates,\" says Pushpesh Pant, a Delhi-based historian and culinary expert.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Good mangoes are not just to be eaten; they are adornments like jewellery. The rules of the mango push the best produce towards those willing to pay the highest price,\" writes Sopan Joshi in Mangifera indica: A Biography of the Mango, a magisterial account of the fruit and its admirers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are more than 1,000 varieties of mango grown in India. Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering. Poet Ghalib called the mango a \"a sealed glass of honey\", and hundreds of books have been written celebrating its allure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Part indulgence, part icon, the mango continues to delight and inspire - now with a surprising nod from science.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Russian troops quickly reached the outskirts of Kyiv and seized huge swathes of the south, including big chunks of two more oblasts, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The war has ebbed and flowed ever since. Russia now controls rather less territory - down from about 27% in the spring of 2022 to around 20% now. In the east, Russian forces are advancing, but very slowly and at great cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now. European allies also insist on a halt in fighting. US President Donald Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin,  Trump has talked instead about territorial swaps. That has sent shockwaves across Kyiv and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows:</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Kyiv, such a concession would be a bitter pill to swallow. For Moscow, whose losses have been even more catastrophic, it would be seen as victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine \"could not\" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pushing hard, and making progress, near the town of Dobropillya. But it's not yet clear whether this marks a significant strategic move or just an effort to show Trump that Moscow has the upper hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What about Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, captured in 2022? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here, it's reported, Russia is offering to halt its offensive and freeze the lines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But would Russia be prepared to give any of it back? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Trump talked vaguely about \"ocean-front property\" – presumably a reference to some of this shoreline, along the Sea of Azov or Black Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is all part of Putin's strategically vital land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's hard to see the Russian leader agreeing to give any of it up. Like Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin regards these places as part of Russia, and illegally annexed them three years ago in four referendums widely regarded as a sham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine, and Europe, territorial swaps – at this very early stage of the talks – are a non-starter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A discussion about future borders may eventually come, but only when the war has stopped and Ukraine's security has been guaranteed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

On Friday, it expected to scrap 500 flights, affecting 100,000 passengers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With the strike in effect, the airline announced it would halt flights on its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the cancellations mounted, the Canadian government used its powers to force the airline and the union into binding arbitration, in an effort to minimise disruptions for travel and the economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The airline, which operates in 64 countries and has a fleet of 259 aircraft, warned that a \"complete cessation of flying\" would begin on Saturday, if the labour issues were not resolved.

The company asked the government to intervene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Government representatives had facilitated some of the negotiations already, but the carrier went further and asked Canada's jobs minister, Patty Hajdu, to refer the matter for binding arbitration.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How did the government respond to the strike? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday,  Hajdu ordered Air Canada and Cupe into binding arbitration by invoking Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Despite significant supports from the government, these parties have been unable to resolve their differences in a timely manner,\" Hadju said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I am exercising this authority because it is critical to maintaining and securing industrial peace, protecting Canadians and promoting conditions to resolve the dispute.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cupe has responded by accusing the of Liberal Party of \"violating our charter rights\". They allege that forcing a bargain to end the strike will \"ensure unresolved issues will continue to worsen by kicking them down the road\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, Air Canada proposed having a third party step in to develop an agreement through what is called \"binding arbitration\", but the union rejected this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It then asked the government to force the parties into binding arbitration, pointing to recent government interventions in negotiations in the rail and port sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In binding arbitration, an independent third party sets the terms of a contract in an agreement that is legally enforceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The union said in a statement on Friday that it had requested that Hajdu not intervene and, instead, allow \"the parties to reach a resolution through free and fair negotiations, without undue interference\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There was growing pressure from other parts of Canada, as well. The Board of Trade for the Toronto region had called<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>for government intervention, while the province of  Newfoundland and Labrador released a statement describing the impact of a strike as \"catastrophic\" for the tourism industry during the summer season.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What to do if your flight is cancelled</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Air Canada has said it will notify passengers if there is a change to the flight's scheduled departure time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Customers whose flights are cancelled will be notified and will receive a full refund, the airline said. The company has also made arrangements with other Canadian and foreign carriers to provide customers alternative travel options.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If it's a round trip, return flights are not automatically cancelled in case the passengers reaches the destination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those bookings can be cancelled with no fees.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There were friends that were like, 'He's actually an amazing guy, he's so great'. There was a lot of people whispering in my ear about you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said it was exactly the moment she had \"been writing songs about, wanting to happen to me since I was a teenager\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was wild, but it worked...
