The tariff would come into force on 27 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, the US president accused India of not caring \"how many people in Ukraine are being killed by the Russian war machine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before Wednesday's talks, Zelensky warned that Russia would only make serious moves towards peace if it began to run out of money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Expectations are muted for a settlement by Friday, and Russia has continued its large-scale air attacks on Ukraine despite Trump's threats of sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before taking office in January, Trump claimed he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine in a day. He failed, and his rhetoric towards Russia has since hardened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We thought we had [the war] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,\" he said last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul have failed to bring the war closer to and end, three-and-a-half years after Moscow launched its full-invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moscow's military and political preconditions for peace remain unacceptable to Kyiv and to its Western partners. The Kremlin has also repeatedly turned down Kyiv's requests for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the US administration approved $200m (£150m) of additional military sales to Ukraine on Tuesday following a phone call between Zelensky and Trump, in which the two leaders also discussed defence cooperation and drone production. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukraine has been using drones to hit Russia's refineries and energy facilities, while Moscow has focused its air attacks on Ukraine's cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Kyiv City Military Administration said the toll of an attack on the city last week rose to 32 after a man died of his injuries. The strike was the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypdxnz6k2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">deadliest on Kyiv</a> since the start of the invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainian authorities on Wednesday reported that a Russian attack on a holiday camp in the central region of Zaporizhzhia left two dead and 12 wounded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's no military sense in this attack.

They climbed on top of the trucks, causing the drivers to lose control, local journalists told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The area was under Israeli military control and the roads were rugged and dangerous, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmoud Basal said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The private transport association now operating in Gaza said that 26 commercial trucks entered the territory on Tuesday.

He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And he identified issues with other key components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"David Lochridge David Lochridge onboard the deck of a ship.

He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I brought up all the issues that I was seeing… but I was just met with resistance all the way,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Titan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Towards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: \"I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks.\" he said. \"OSHA did nothing.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'They beat us down'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned… We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. \"I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had \"followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety… but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The spokesperson said: \"The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The investigation found that the email from OSHA to the coast guard about Mr Lochridge's complaint was not received. It had been sent to a staff member who had responsibility for monitoring OSHA cases – but the employee had moved on to a new job within the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jason Neubauer,  the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate said that in the wake of the accident, it had permanently wound down operations and directed its resources towards cooperating with the inquiry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Since he returned to office in January, recorded aerial attacks from Moscow have reached their highest levels of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to bring an end to fighting in just one day if returned to office. He claimed during his 2024 campaign that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been averted had a president who the Kremlin \"respected\" held office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pauses - announced in March and July and since reversed by the president - came as Russia steadily increased missile and drone production. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, ballistic missile construction in Russia grew by 66% over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared with 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long,\" White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to Nato members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. During this period, Russian attacks on Ukraine briefly fell when compared with the final weeks of the Biden administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The talks, which Rubio said were a starting point to bring an end to the war, have been followed by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crene7d5w2jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">mediated discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials</a> in Turkey. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Attacks peaked early last month, when Moscow launched 748 drones and missiles towards Ukraine on 9 July, according to the Ukrainian Air Force data. More than a dozen people were <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3rvpe06rxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reportedly injured by the barrage and two were killed</a>.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Trump has expressed anger at the escalating Russian attacks on several occasions, his mounting frustration does not appear to have had an impact on Moscow's strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: \"What the hell happened to him [Putin]?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. Trump has responded by demanding that the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c707zrrd7xqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Kremlin reach a peace deal with Ukraine by 8 August</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live,\" Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The growing attacks have renewed calls for the US to send fresh supplies of Patriot anti-air batteries to Ukraine. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has overturned the previous supply pauses and agreed to sell weapons to Nato members, who will in turn supply them to Kyiv. Trump appeared to imply that the deal would include fresh supplies of Patriot batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Justin Bronk, an analyst focussing on the Russian military at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said restrictions on the supply of military equipment imposed by the White House had made Ukraine \"vulnerable\" to missile and drone attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also noted that Russia has ramped up the production of missiles and so-called 'kamikaze' drones such as the Geran-2 - a domestically produced version of the Iranian Shahed drone. Mr Bronk said that Russia's increased stockpiles, coupled with \"significant reductions\" in supply of US interceptor missiles had encouraged Moscow to escalate its air campaign.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A captured Geran drone in Ukraine.

The US government has taken a stake in that company as well, while committing to a minimum price for its output. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since his return to office, Trump has often promoted high-profile commitments of investments by firms like Apple.

The regions of Sicilia and Calabria are two of the poorest in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the project will still need to be rubber-stamped by the Italian Court of Auditors as well as environmental agencies, both at national and EU level.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local residents on either side of the strait whose properties may be expropriated will also have to be consulted and could legally challenge the decision, meaning the construction of the bridge may be delayed or stall altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It would not be the first time that the bridge's building has been held up. Since the first plans for it were drawn up more than 50 years ago, various ideas for it have had to be shelved for various reasons and it has long faced stern opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has included concerns that huge amounts of taxpayers' money would be siphoned off by the Sicilian and Calabrian mafias, which have a broad influence over politics and society in southern Italy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, local politicians reiterated their unhappiness with the government's decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Nicola Irto of the Democratic Party (PD) called the project was \"controversial and divisive\", saying it would divert \"crucial resources from local transportation, modern infrastructure, safe schools and quality healthcare facilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Giusy Caminiti, the mayor of Villa San Giovanni near where the bridge would be built on the Calabrian shore, said her town would be badly affected and urged more time for consultations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Grassroots Calabrian committee \"No to the Bridge\" slammed Wednesday's announcement and said it was a political manoeuvre, rather than the outcome of a thorough technical evaluation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local groups that oppose the bridge also say its construction would use millions of litres of water a day while both Sicily and Calabria regularly struggle with drought. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently the only way for trains to cross the Strait is to have the coaches shunted onto ferries and carried over the sea in a 30-minute journey. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Now that looks increasingly difficult, if not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So what went wrong?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A series of missteps, grandstanding, geopolitics and domestic political pressure seem to have broken down the negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi has been restrained in its response so far to Trump's tirades, hoping that diplomacy might eventually help secure a trade deal. But in Trump's White House, there are no guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has commented on many issues that Delhi considers red lines. The biggest among them is Trump repeatedly putting <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwq0y7d14lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">India and its rival Pakistan on an equal footing</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Oil tanker trucks outside an oil refinery operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp.

He went as far as saying that some day, Pakistan might sell oil to India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another constant irritant for Delhi is Trump's repeated assertion that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India sees its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as its internal affair and has always rejected third-party mediation on the issue. Most world leaders have been sensitive to Delhi's position, including Trump in his first stint as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that's no longer the case. The US president has doubled down on his claim even after Modi told India's parliament that \"no country had mediated in the ceasefire\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi didn't name Trump or the US but domestic political pressure is mounting on him not to \"bow down\" to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The fact that this is happening against the backdrop of heavy and high-level US engagement with Islamabad immediately after an India-Pakistan conflict is even more galling for Delhi and the wider Indian public. This all sharpens concerns harboured by some in India that the US can't truly be trusted as a partner,\" says Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that some of the anger in Delhi might \"be Cold War-era baggage coming to the fore\", but \"this time around it's intensified by real-time developments as well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi's government thrives on nationalist issues, so its supporters would likely expect a firm response to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a Catch-22 situation - Delhi still wants to clinch a deal but also doesn't want to come across as buckling under Trump's pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it appears that Delhi is gradually releasing the restraint. In its response to Washington's anger over India's purchase of Russian oil, Delhi vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard its \"national interests and economic security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question is why Trump, who loved India's hospitality and called it a great country earlier, has gone on a tirade against a trusted ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts see his insults as a pressure tactic to secure a deal that he thinks works for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is a real estate magnate and a tough negotiator. His style may not be diplomatic, but he seeks the outcomes diplomats would. So, I think what he's doing is part of a negotiating strategy,\" says Jitendra Nath Misra, a former Indian ambassador and now a professor at OP Jindal Global University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A source in the Indian government said that Delhi gave many concessions to Washington, including no tariffs on industrial goods, and a phased reduction of tariffs on cars and alcohol. It also signed a deal to let Elon Musk's Starlink start operations in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Washington wanted access to India's agriculture and dairy sectors to reduce the $45bn trade deficit it runs with Delhi.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c938/live/7446e710-71ad-11f0-9882-df01d6887c8b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin welcomes Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for an informal meeting at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence, outside Moscow, on July 8, 2024. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Delhi has said that India and Russia have a time-tested partnership</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But these sectors are a red line for Modi or, for that matter, any Indian prime minister.

Moscow has traditionally come to Delhi's rescue during past crises and still enjoys support among the wider Indian public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moscow is also Delhi's biggest arms supplier, though its share in India's defence import portfolio dropped to 36% between 2020-25 from 55% between 2016 and 2020, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was largely due to Delhi boosting domestic manufacturing and buying more from the US, France and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Russia's role in India's defence strategy can't be overstated.

How Delhi reacts will decide the future of the India-US relationship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has been measured in its response so far but is not holding back completely. In its statement, it said that the US had encouraged it to keep buying oil from Russia for global energy market stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also said that targeting it was unjustified as the EU continues to buy energy, fertiliser, mining and chemical products from Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things seem bad, some analysts say that all is not lost. India and the US have close links in many sectors, which can't be uprooted overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries cooperate closely in the space technology, IT, education and defence sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many large domestic IT firms have invested heavily in the US, and most big Silicon Valley firms have operations in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think the fundamentals of the relationship are not weak. It's a paradox that the day Trump announced 25% tariffs and unspecified penalties, India and the US collaborated in a strategic area when an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy98jnreqvvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Indian rocket sent a jointly-developed satellite into space</a>,\" says Mr Misra. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It will be interesting to see how India reacts to Trump's sharp rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is unapologetically transactional and commercial in his approach to foreign policy. He has no compunction about deploying these potentially alienating harsh tactics against a close US partner like India,\" says Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he adds that there's a lot of trust baked into the partnership, given the work that has gone into it over the past two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So what's lost can potentially be regained.

If that protein in the coronavirus changes or mutates then the body's protection is lessened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We have seen the consequences of that – immunity wanes and the vaccines need to be updated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One theoretical argument is that a different vaccine approach – such as using the whole virus – would give better protection, as the immune system would have more to target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Prof Pollard says the mRNA vaccines performed better than the inactivated ones when tackling Covid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He says that is probably down to the way they are made - and the fact that the process of killing the virus also \"changes the viral proteins so there is less stimulation of the immune system\" in comparison with mRNA vaccines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The need to update vaccines is not a failing of mRNA technology that can be easily solved by pivoting from one technology to another - instead, it is down to the fundamental nature of some viruses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The same measles or HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But some viruses live in a perpetual state of flux.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Flu, for example, is not one virus - but instead a constantly-shifting target. At any time, one strain will be in the ascendancy and be the most likely to cause trouble in winter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In flu, the inactivated flu injection that is given to adults is updated every year - as is the live vaccine that is given to children as a nasal spray. A future mRNA form of flu vaccine would work the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The point about keeping up with variants is about all technologies, not just mRNA,\" says Prof Pollard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">mRNA is 'streets ahead' when speed is needed</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a legitimate scientific question about which vaccine technology is used for which disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What is causing concern among scientists is that pulling mRNA research means we will not have those vaccines at times when we need to do what no other technology can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard says: \"I don't think there's the evidence they are hugely better for protection, but where RNA tech is streets ahead of everything else is responding to outbreaks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The world is highly drilled at making new flu vaccines each year. But even then, there is a six-month process of deciding on the new flu strains to be targeted, growing the vaccine at scale in chicken eggs and then distributing it. Brand new vaccines take even longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But with mRNA, you can have the new vaccine in six to eight weeks, and then tens or hundreds of millions of doses a few months later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the projects that have had their funding pulled in the US were preparing for a bird flu pandemic. That virus, H5N1, has been devastating bird populations and jumping into a wide range of other animals including American cattle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That doesn't make sense and if we do get a human pandemic of bird flu it could be seen as a catastrophic error,\" says Prof Finn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the ramifications of the US turning away from mRNA research could be felt more widely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What impact does this move have on confidence in the current vaccines, mRNA or otherwise? How does it affect the world when the US is one of the most influential countries in medical research? And will it have a knock-on impact on other types of mRNA technology, such as cancer vaccines - or using the approach to treat rare genetic diseases?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard poses another question after RFK Jr's move: \"Does it put us all at risk if a huge market is turning its back on RNA?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is one of the most important technologies we'll see this century in infectious disease, biotherapeutic agents for rare disease and critically for cancer. It's a message I'm troubled about.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Any formal declaration as such would be considered as an act of war by Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Lai has in the past described himself as a \"pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence\", he has also insisted Taiwan has no need to formally declare independence because it is already a sovereign nation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te inspects the troops taking part in the Rapid Response Exercise during a visit at the Songshan military airbase in Taipei on March 21, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Taiwan's President William Lai on a recent visit to a military base </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zero Day Attack has also garnered positive reviews.

Another round will take place later this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has led to questions about the show's timing and if it was meant to influence the recall votes.

About two months later, he finally made it to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan, a soft-spoken man in his late 50s from a small village in Jiangxi province in eastern China, is one of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals who have made the same journey in recent years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Known colloquially as zou xian ke, or \"those who walked the line\", they represent a new wave of migration driven by authoritarian tightening at home and the belief – sometimes naive, often desperate – that the US still offers a fair shot at a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their reasons for exodus varied, but their experiences once on American soil follow certain trends: many have ended up isolated by language, burdened by debt and surviving on gig work as they wait for their asylum claims to crawl through an overwhelming immigration system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some remain hopeful. Others are unravelling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And all of them, now, are living in the long shadow of President Donald Trump's political return - during which the poor US-China relations of recent years have soured even further. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Fatman Ding Plaza, sitting in the centre of Monterey Park, a city outside of Los Angeles, is the \"ground zero\" of Chinese migrants who came to the US</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'Hard work here brings hope'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan is one of several Chinese migrants who I first met two years ago. Like many of the group who he travelled with, he now works in a Chinese restaurant, even though back home, he prided himself on his farming know-how. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In America, those skills don't translate, since the soil conditions are different and he doesn't speak English. Past lives hold little currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a while after arriving, Pan wandered from city to city, sleeping on borrowed couches or bunking with fellow migrants. Eventually, he landed in Barstow, California, a dusty industrial town.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His life today is penned within a tight radius. He cooks and sometimes waits tables at a restaurant during the day, video-calls his wife and children in China at night, and repeats the routine the next day. He lives in a room attached to the kitchen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To outsiders, and even to his family back home, Pan's life might seem unbearably monotonous. But to him, it's defined not by what's lacking, but by what's no longer present. No land seizures. No meddling officials. No fear of arbitrary punishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My family doesn't understand,\" he said with a half-smile. \"They ask why I left a comfortable life behind. But here, even if it's simple, it's mine. It's free.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan's sense of freedom is quiet but stubborn. Two years ago, in a cramped hotel room in Quito, Ecuador, he told me on the eve of his journey that even if he died en route, it would be worth it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He still says the same. \"All of this,\" he repeated, \"is worth it.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Like many newcomers, Pan doesn't have any meaningful social circle – the mounting language and cultural difference challenges confine his life to interactions with fellow migrants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Occasionally, he travels to Los Angeles to join protests outside the Chinese consulate. He admits that is partly to strengthen his asylum claim by establishing a public record of political dissent. But it is also because, after decades of silence, he can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 4 June, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre – a date scrubbed from China's public memory by the authorities – he stood again outside the consulate chanting anti-Chinese Communist Party slogans. That day, among the familiar crowd, he spotted James.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A young man in his early 30s who hailed from western China, James had travelled with Pan from Ecuador through the Darién Gap and up to the US border. But if Pan's story is one of quiet stoicism, James's is more kinetic, more restless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After his release from a US immigration detention centre, James bounced between cash gigs in Monterey Park, a Chinese-majority suburb east of Los Angeles. He ultimately bought a cargo van, drove out to Palm Springs, and made the car both his livelihood and his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The van is cluttered with sleeping bags, gas canisters, and a portable charger - that's all he needs to be content with his life. During the day, he delivers food around the city; at night, he parks outside a 24-hour gym and sleeps with the windows open.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">James was always a hustler in China. But after Covid tanked the economy and political crackdowns left little room to breathe, he decided to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At least your hard work here brings hope, but back in China, you could work over ten hours a day and see no future,\" James told me.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">James, from China's western Qinghai province, is now a delivery driver in Palm Springs, California</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'America is becoming another China'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet hope alone isn't enough. For nearly all the newcomers, including James and Pan who are by and large content with their life in the US, Trump's political return has brought back a gnawing sense of instability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The wave of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids across southern California, Trump's continuous push to deport undocumented immigrants, and rising US-China tensions including a battle over trade tariffs, have all deepened a climate of paranoia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As I was re-connecting with the migrants who I first met in 2023, clashes between protesters and the government police forces were unfolding in downtown Los Angeles over recent ICE raids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The raids were part of the president's aim to enact the \"biggest deportation operation\" in US history - a pledge that helped him to win the White House again last year. A CBS News/YouGov poll conducted in early June found 54% of Americans saying they approved of his deportation policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The administration says its raids have primarily targeted people with criminal records, although critics say innocent people have been caught up in the drive - sparking anxiety among migrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly all of the migrants I reconnected with now hold what's called an Employment Authorisation Document (EAD) that allows them to legally work in the US, but they have not been granted official asylum status. In Trump's expansive ICE raid campaign, people who hold exactly the same status as these migrants have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But what's the driving the fear is a sense of unknowing - of if and when these raids will reach the Chinese community, or when the next downturn of China-US relations could be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Between the two Trump presidencies, US-China relations hardly improved when Joe Biden served in the White House. The Democrat kept earlier Trump tariffs in place, and tensions rose as Beijing escalated its rhetoric over the status of US ally Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For some, all the unease has prompted a question that many Chinese migrants have quietly begun to ask themselves: is America worth it?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kevin, a man in his thirties from China's Fujian province, didn't think so. Like Pan and James, Kevin journeyed through Latin America to reach the US. But the American dream he once believed in now feels like a mirage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When I asked him how settled he was in California's San Gabriel Valley, where he lives with his wife and their newborn son, he referred to the ICE raids in LA and answered: \"Everything feels uncertain. So no, I don't feel settled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kevin's disillusionment runs deep. \"America, to me, feels like it's becoming another China,\" he said. \"A Darwinian society.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If I had known what it would really be like, I might not have come,\" he continued.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Caught in a pincer</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a long time, what bound all these migrants was the journey they shared on that treacherous road.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now, that binding has an extra layer: the emotional undercurrent they now swim against two years after they arrived in the US. It is the creeping realisation that their place in America is precarious, that the country they bet everything on might not have space for them after all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The zouxian wave was driven by desperation – but also by an almost childlike faith in the American idea: that this country, for all its flaws, still offered a shot at dignity. A delivery job. A sliver of land. A bed behind a restaurant where no one came knocking at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, with Trump portraying China as national security threat, warning of \"infiltration,\" and promising sweeping crackdowns on many things China-related, even those modest hopes feel more under siege than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The effect is clear. This new wave of Chinese migrants – many of them still awaiting asylum – now feel themselves caught in a pincer: mistrusted by Americans, unwanted by Beijing, and sometimes suspended in legal limbo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pan, for one, is bracing for the worst. \"The future here doesn't feel as certain anymore,\" he said, standing outside the restaurant in Barstow, watching the freeway traffic blur past. \"I'm worried I might not be allowed to stay. And if I go back to China…\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He trailed off. For a moment, he said nothing. Then he looked at me, steady, calm, resigned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That thought,\" he said, \"is unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was the same look I remembered from that hotel room in Quito, two years and a world ago: worry flickering behind tired eyes, but beneath it, a core of absolute resolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No matter what happens, Pan told me, he's staying.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That led to a spike in inflation around the world. President Trump says he isn't worried because of record US oil production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Tompkins points out that, this time, there are also other reasons to suggest the impact on prices would not be as marked. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explains that \"the current backdrop is one where Opec+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example, its so-called \"shadow fleet\" - consisting of hundreds of tankers with obscure ownership - could be used to conceal the origin of exported Russian oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sanctions maintenance is as big a task as the imposition of sanctions in the first place,\" US sanctions expert Richard Nephew of Columbia University says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Two young people carry a handpainted poster of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump with the writing \"Unpredictable &amp; shocking 25% tariff + penalty\"' class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" the country's foreign ministry said</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Pricier iPhones from India</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.russiafossiltracker.com/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're fuelling the war machine. And if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy,\" President Trump told US outlet CNBC on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A day later, Trump signed an executive order hitting India with an additional 25% tariff over its purchases of Russian oil and raising the total tariff on Indian imports to the US to 50% - among the highest rates imposed by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If secondary sanctions take effect in 21 days' as Trump's executive order specifies, US companies buying goods from India will have to pay a 100% import tax - or tariff - when those products reach US shores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The idea is that it makes these goods so expensive that US businesses will choose to buy them cheaper from elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That, in turn, is supposed to deter India from buying Russian oil. And if Russia is left unable to sell its oil elsewhere because other countries face the same predicament, it will have less cash to finance the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One way in which Americans could experience higher prices as a result of new secondary tariffs is in their purchase of mobile phones from India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">production to India</a> - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If these products are subject to the new tariffs, prices could rise significantly for US consumers. That is because tariffs are paid by the companies that import goods - and those companies tend to pass most, if not all, of their cost increases on to their customers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Imports to the US from India were already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's government has accused the US of double standards, pointing to Washington's own continued trade with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from India which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that's just 10% of 2021 levels. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That trade is dominated by US purchases of raw materials for nuclear energy and fertilizers.

Brussels recently agreed to buy a lot <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">more energy from the US</a>, but some imports from Russia remain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1504\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">acknowledged the problem</a>, saying \"Russia has repeatedly attempted to blackmail us by weaponizing its energy supplies\" as she laid out plans to end imports by the end of 2027.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US-EU trade relationship is the biggest in the world, and the pair have just negotiated new trade terms<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>which will see a 15% tariff be applied on most EU exports to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many in the EU <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgp5q4x4nzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">criticised that deal</a>, saying the tariffs would harm European exporters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now they also fear that secondary sanctions on the EU could do even more harm. Adding 100% tariffs for buying Russian energy could significantly reduce the amount of goods sold by the EU to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However the biggest sellers include pharmaceuticals and machinery, which may be hard to source from elsewhere - meaning Americans have little choice but to pay more. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Potential Russian recession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's own economy has so far proven remarkably resilient since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, growing 4.3% last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqnj17vryjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">recently warned</a> that the country was \"on the verge\" of recession after a period of \"overheating\". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting growth of just 0.9% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If the secondary sanctions are successful in reducing demand for exports, they will push Russia closer to recession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The exact impact of the war on Russia's economy is hard to know, because Moscow has prevented a large amount of economic data from being published since the full-scale invasion - including on oil and gas production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About a third of Russian government spending is funded by oil and gas money, but exports have been falling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Putin is directing a bigger share of spending towards defence than at any time since the Cold War. Defence spending is believed to have reached 6.3% of GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By contrast, Ukraine has been spending a huge 26% of the value of its far-smaller economy on the war. The difference explains why its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly asked for external help from his allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's tariffs are intended to help Zelensky by cutting the amount of money flowing into Russia, and he hopes bring an end to the death, suffering and destruction in Ukraine.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

By the 1980s, Iliescu was out of politics and working as a director at a government-affiliated academic publishing house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His re-emergence during the 1989 revolution, which lasted from 16-25 December and saw more than 1,000 people killed, was seen by some as opportunistic, but to others, it was a stabilising presence amid chaos. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As leader of the National Salvation Front (FSN), a political organisation that formed during the revolution, Iliescu became Romania's interim president and oversaw the rapid dismantling of Ceausescu's regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Christmas Day, Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad after a trial at a military base that lasted two hours.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: The fall of the Ceaușescus - when Romania stood up to tyranny</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 1990, he won Romania's first democratic election in more than 50 years with a staggering 85% of the vote. But the campaign was marred by disinformation and state-aligned propaganda against liberal rivals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later that year, Iliescu faced growing protests from students and opposition supporters. His now-infamous call for miners to descend on the capital to \"restore order\" led to days of brutal street violence known as the Mineriads, during which dozens were injured and several killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He served another full term after winning the 1992 elections, then returned for a final presidency between 2000 and 2004.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Turbulent years followed the revolution. Deep-rooted and insidious influential figures, dating back to the communist era persisted, and Iliescu's presidency was marked by widespread corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Critics argue that his reluctance to fully reform the justice system or confront the legacy of the Securitate – the feared secret police – allowed a culture of impunity to take root. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than three decades on from the revolution, Romania still struggles with political corruption and remains one of the poorest and most corrupt members of the European Union – a reality that some trace back to Iliescu's rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His later years in office saw progress on Romania's Western integration – including Nato membership and the closing of EU accession talks. There were also market reforms, allowing small businesses to open, and Romania adopted its first democratic constitution in 1991, which still shapes the country today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Iliescu remained dogged by questions over his role in the bloodshed of the early 1990s.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2017, he was formally indicted for crimes against humanity in connection with both the 1989 revolution and the 1990 Mineriads. The legal proceedings dragged on for years without resolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After stepping down, Iliescu remained a respected figure within the Social Democratic Party (PSD), eventually being named honorary president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He largely withdrew from public life in his later years but occasionally posted political commentary on his personal blog. His final entry, in May 2025, congratulated President Nicusor Dan on his electoral victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ion Iliescu built Romania's democracy, Teodor Tita says, but he was \"also a ruthless politician who wasn't afraid to incite violent conflicts between competing parts of the society\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As a politician, Iliescu was ruthless, skilful and always with an eye to history.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He has also threatened to expel them from office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Democrats left because at least two-thirds of the 150-member legislative body must be present to proceed with a vote on re-drawing Texas's electoral map. The plan would create five more Republican-leaning seats in the US House of Representatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This high stakes battle may seem both bizarre and confusing – but it is one that could spread to other states in advance of next year's national midterm elections. At its heart, it's a bare-knuckle fight over political power, who can wield it most effectively and who can keep it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why does Trump want redistricting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US House of Representatives is made up of 435 legislators who are elected every two years. They represent districts with boundaries determined in processes set by their state governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Who draws the lines and how can go a long way in shaping the ideological tilt of the district and the likelihood that it elects a Democrat or a Republican.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the moment, the House rests on a knife edge with 219 Republicans and 212 Democrats. There are four vacancies likely to be filled by three Democrats and one Republican in special elections later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It wouldn't take much of a shift in the political winds for Democrats to take back control of the House of Representatives in next year's midterm elections. And the party that controls the lower chamber of Congress has powers that extend far beyond simply setting the legislative agenda for the next two years, as important as that may be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">House leaders can launch sweeping investigations of presidential actions, as Democrats did in the second half of Donald Trump's first term and Republicans did in Joe Biden's final two years. They can also dig in on policy issues and trigger government shutdowns. They can even vote to impeach a president, as Democrats did in December 2019 and Republicans contemplated during Biden's presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump appears focused on taking steps to improve his odds of avoiding a similar fate in his second term. He is reportedly fixated on the midterm races and encouraging Texas lawmakers to draw new congressional maps that could increase the likelihood of Republicans winning more House seats from there.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How does redistricting usually work?</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: What is gerrymandering? We use gummy bears to explain</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">District lines are typically redrawn every 10 years, after a national census, to reflect shifts in the population within and between states. The most recent regularly scheduled redistricting took place in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In some states, the process is set by independent commissions but in others the state legislatures are responsible for line-drawing – and the results can frequently be crafted by the party in power to give their side a distinct advantage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In North Carolina, for instance, Republican-drawn lines gave their party 10 of the state's 14 House seats in last year's national elections even though Trump only won the state by a slim margin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Democrats in Illinois hold 14 of the state's 17 House seats, while former Vice-President Kamala Harris won the state with 54%. If Trump has his way, and the maps lead to a five-seat gain next year, Republicans would control 30 of the state's 38 seats. Last year, he won Texas with 56%.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">So what could happen next?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Republican push in Texas has leaders in Democratic-controlled states calling for a response, which could set off a redistricting \"arms race\" that spreads across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">California Governor Gavin Newsom, for example, has asked legislators in his state, where Democrats control 43 of the 52 seats, to find ways to increase their advantage. Governors Kathy Hochul in New York and JB Pritzker in Illinois have issued similar calls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Everything's on the table,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on social media. \"We've got to do everything we can to stand up and fight back - we're not sitting around and complaining from the sidelines when we have the ability to stop them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Grassroots Democrats, many of whom have been frustrated by the inability of their party's national political leaders to block the Trump administration's policy agenda, may welcome such confrontational language. States like California and New York have laws that mandate congressional districts be drawn by a bipartisan commission to create constituencies that are compact and fair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such efforts were the result of a push to remove political considerations from the redistricting process, but now some Democrats view those moves as unilateral disarmament that gave Republicans an advantage in the fight for a House majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm tired of fighting this fight with my hand tied behind my back,\" Hochul told reporters at the New York Capitol in Albany on Monday. \"With all due respect to the good government groups, politics is a political process.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She said the \"playing field\" has changed dramatically during Trump's second term and Democrats need to adjust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Democrats may not have the final say, however. Republicans are already looking beyond Texas for more places to pick up seats. Vice-President JD Vance is reported to be considering a trip to Indiana later this week to push for new district lines in that state. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis recently said his Republican-dominated state may undertake a similar process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite its explicit political designs, all of this is fair game under the US Constitution – at least the way a narrow majority of the US Supreme Court interpreted it in a landmark 2019 case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Partisan \"gerrymandering\", as the process is sometimes called, has a long tradition in US politics – one that frequently creates oddly shaped constituencies that stretch for miles to include, or exclude, voters based on their political affiliations, all with the goal of giving one party an electoral majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Republican move in Texas isn't even without precedent. In 2003, Republican leaders redrew their congressional maps to boost their electoral advantage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The state's Democrats even responded in a similar way – leaving the state to delay the legislative proceedings. The redistricting ultimately passed after enough Democrats returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a risk in all of this, even for the party doing the line-drawing. While the goal is to maximise the number of seats where victory is probable, in an election where one side outperforms expectations even seemingly safe seats can flip sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Texas, and other redistricting states, could create an electoral map that does not survive a political deluge, leading to otherwise avoidable losses at the ballot box.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a close election, however, every seat counts. And if next year's midterm elections continue the recent trend of narrowly decided political battles, what happens in state legislatures over the next few months could have dramatic political consequences in Washington DC – and, consequently, across America.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.
