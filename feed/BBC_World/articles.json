There is little documentation of its subsequent use, but it is believed to have been taken out of circulation at some point in the 1930s, because of concerns about its long-lasting effects. CS gas - often referred to as \"tear gas\" - was used as a replacement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Konstantine Chakhunashvili was one of those who gathered outside Georgia's parliament in Tbilisi during the first week of protests - which began on 28 November 2024. Demonstrators were incensed by the ruling party's announcement that it was pausing EU accession talks. The goal of EU membership is enshrined in Georgia's constitution.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Konstantine Chakhunashvili ran a study on protesters' symptoms after he himself suffered ill-effects from the water cannon</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia's police responded with a variety of riot-control measures including the use of water cannon, pepper spray and CS gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili, a paediatrician who was among those sprayed by the cannons, and who has taken part in many of the demonstrations, said his skin felt like it was burning for days, and the sensation couldn't be washed away. In fact, he said, \"it was worse when trying to wash it off\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili wanted to find out if others had suffered similar effects. So he appealed, via social media, for those also targeted by crowd control measures during the first week of the demonstrations to fill out a survey. Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lasha Shergelashvili Lasha wearing army fatigues and a cap standing on an armoured vehicle and resting his arm on a mounted rifle \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Lasha Shergelashvili</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lasha Shergelashvili used to be in charge of weaponry for Georgia's riot police</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas. Even after we washed our faces with water, and then with a special solution of baking soda and water, which was prepared in advance, we still couldn't breathe freely.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shergelashvili says that as a result of his tests, he recommended against the chemical's use. But he says the water cannon vehicles were nevertheless loaded with it - and that this remained the case at least up until 2022, when he quit his job and left the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking from his new home in Ukraine, he tells the BBC that when watching footage of the protests last year, he immediately suspected that demonstrators were being subjected to the same chemical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colleagues he has remained in touch with, and who are still in post, have also told him this is the case, he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the BBC spoke to another former high-level police officer who confirmed that whatever was loaded into the water cannon vehicles when Mr Shergelashvili was in position was the same compound deployed in the protests of November-December 2024.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"><i id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-at-19:00,-1-december-on-bbc-two\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"viewers-in-the-uk-can-see-more-on-global-eye-at-19:00,-1-december-on-bbc-two\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Viewers in the UK can see more on Global Eye at 19:00, 1 December on BBC Two</b></i><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i></li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"><i id=\"outside-the-uk,-watch-the-film-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"outside-the-uk,-watch-the-film-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Outside the UK, watch the film on </b></i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/z4-koO916Gk\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 kgTYQp\"><i id=\"bbc-world-service-youtube\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"bbc-world-service-youtube\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">BBC World Service YouTube</b></i></a></li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Mr Shergelashvili was asked if the product he tested could have just been CS gas - which irritates the eyes, skin and respiratory system, but only temporarily -  he said it appeared to be far stronger than that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I cannot name an example or compare it with anything [else],\" he said, adding it was \"probably 10 times\" stronger than more conventional riot-control agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For example, if you spill this chemical on the ground, you won't be able to stay in that area for the next two to three days, even if you wash it off with water.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shergelashvili does not know the name of the chemical he was asked to test.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the BBC managed to obtain a copy of the inventory of the Special Tasks Department, dated December 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We discovered it contained two unnamed chemicals. These were simply listed as \"Chemical liquid UN1710\" and \"Chemical powder UN3439\", along with instructions for how they should be mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We wanted to check whether this inventory was authentic, so we showed it to another  former high-ranking police officer from the riot police who confirmed it seemed genuine. He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our next step was to work out what these chemicals were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Shutterstock Hundreds of people demonstrating in the Georgian capital - massing on the street in the darkness with the parliament lit up to the side.

Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Camite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards.

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early polling results from the Honduras general election show Nasry Asfura, leader of the right-wing National Party, has a very narrow lead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their first update on the vote, the electoral council said that the conservative candidate was just ahead of former TV host and vice president Salvador Nasralla, with a little over a third of the ballots counted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asfura has been backed by US President Donald Trump, who has threatened to cut financial aid to the Central American nation if his preferred candidate does not win. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stressing that the results were both \"preliminary and partial\", the head of the agency said that the race was on a knife-edge between the two conservative candidates. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asfura is fractionally in the lead with 40.6% of the vote, while his nearest challenger, Nasralla, is on 38.8%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In third place is the ruling leftwing Libre party candidate, Rixi Moncada. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are five presidential candidates, but the poll is essentially being seen as a three-way race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are still a lot of ballots left to be counted, and the lead could easily change hands as the votes come in, especially from the more remote communities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, so far it has been an encouraging night for Asfura's supporters – both in Honduras, and in Washington.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Voting was extended for an hour in some places where there were long queues, but most Hondurans it seems were able to cast their votes without issue. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main parties and their candidates have all said they will respect the outcome of the election – although the Libre party has said it will not accept a decision based on preliminary results, only on the final count of the paper ballots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Presidents in Honduras can only serve a single four-year term, so the incumbent, Xiomara Castro, who was the country's first female president when she took office in 2021 for the Libre party, was not on the ballot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has backed Moncada to take her place. The 60-year-old lawyer has pledged to protect \"natural wealth\" from \"21st-century filibusters who want to privatise everything\" if she wins. Moncada has also expressed her commitment to combating corruption \"in all its forms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Moncada accused Trump of meddling in the election, calling his endorsement of her right-wing opponent \"totally interventionist\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had said that the US would be \"very supportive\" if Asfura won the presidential election, in which voters were also choosing all 128 members of congress and almost 300 local representatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he doesn't win, the United States will not be throwing good money after bad, because a wrong Leader can only bring catastrophic results to a country, no matter which country it is,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US sent more than $193m (£146m) to Honduras last fiscal year, according to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/honduras/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the State Department website</a>, and despite aid cuts, has sent more than $102m this year.

If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has not commented publicly since the verdict was delivered. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, a group of senior lawyers raised concerns with Bangladesh's representative in the UK over how the trial had been conducted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Signatories to that statement included ex-justice secretary Robert Buckland, former attorney general Dominic Grieve, and Lady Cherie Blair, a human rights lawyer and wife of former prime minister Sir Tony Blair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter first reported by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/uk-lawyers-condemn-bangladesh-trial-london-labour-mp-tulip-siddiq\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the Guardian</a>, they said Siddiq had not been able to secure proper legal representation during the trial, adding: \"Such a process is artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The verdict comes <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial</a> over her role in a brutal crackdown against the protests which ultimately forced her from office in July 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was found guilty of crimes against humanity over the deaths of an estimated 1,400 people at the hands of the police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That trial was held in Hasina's absence, as she has been in exile in India since being ousted. She denied the charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq, whose mother is the former prime minister's sister, continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh, including two ongoing trials in relation to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Hasina was given a 21-year prison sentence after being put on trial in her absence alongside two of her children over a land deal in the Purbachal area of the capital, a case which has ran in parallel to the case against Siddiq.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq and her family have also been investigated in relation to allegations of embezzlement around a £3.9bn deal in 2013 connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to the allegations, which originated with claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladeshi authorities have said they estimate that around $234bn (£174bn) was appropriated through corruption during Hasina's reign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prior to Siddiq's resignation from the British government, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said he had not found \"evidence of improprieties\" following an investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he said it was \"regrettable\" Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Siddiq continued to insist she was not guilty of any wrongdoing, she quit her junior ministerial role in order not to be a \"distraction\" for the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq was not compelled by authorities to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant. </p></div></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\". There is no question that in Lebanon in particular there has been a great deal of anticipation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It means a lot to me. He could have visited other countries, but he gave priority to Lebanon while it is still at war,\" Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, leader of the Maronite Catholic Church (to which most Lebanese Christians belong) told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He brings hope when the Lebanese feel abandoned and we feel uplifted,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope's visit here provides a boost to the third of the country that is estimated to be Christian, but all Lebanese have been granted a two-day national holiday and those from all major faiths have welcomed him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Hezbollah, the Shia Muslim political party and militia considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and US, conveyed its greetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an open letter, the group talked of a \"full welcome\" and \"deep appreciation\" for the Pope's \"honourable presence\". Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man in white clerical garb talks to a man in a black business coat. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a \"medium-sized\" one. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space.

Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such vaccination is allowed in an emergency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/animal-diseases/diseases-and-control-measures/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under EU rules,</a> and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Tassos Manakas says he is closed for business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

They'll come to your house and take you into the bush,\" one of them told the BBC.  For his safety, the BBC is not identifying him and is calling him Aliyu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His young son is one of more 300 students abducted when armed men stormed the grounds of St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri village in the central state of Niger in the early hours of 21 November. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the children taken are as young as five years old. About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide. We know where they are, but we can't go there ourselves, it's too dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is desperate with worry - especially as vulnerable captives kept in forest hideouts have died during previous abductions, whether from sickness or because ransoms have not been paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel so bitter and my wife hasn't eaten for days...

The gangs are largely composed of ethnic Fulani people, who are traditionally nomadic herders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No details have been released about whether a ransom was paid to free the girls from Maga.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, it is illegal to pay ransoms in Nigeria. However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Katsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open.

It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life had become expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-chris-ewokor-in-abuja\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Huge brands such as Guinness and Jamesons are major exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2020 supermarkets and corner shops across the country have had to erect physical barriers between sections selling alcoholic drinks and general products, while some bottles and cans of alcohol now carry among the strongest warning labels anywhere in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First signed into Irish law in 2023, products with the new labels - which state drinking causes liver disease and is linked to fatal cancers - are already on sale in pubs and supermarkets across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a move condemned by public health advocates, the Irish government has delayed their compulsory introduction until 2028, blaming uncertainty with world trade - which some believe is the result of lobbying by the drinks industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, the industry body, Drinks Ireland, said it did look to the Irish government to give some \"breathing space\" on health warning labels and that it believes they should be agreed on an EU-wide level.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Labels warn of the link between alcohol and fatal cancers, and advise it can cause liver disease and affect foetuses</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was when Jack moved to Dublin in 2015 to study journalism that he really got to know the capital's nightlife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Dublin's a great spot because it's always spontaneous drinking, and that's why it's famous,\" he says. \"It's very pub-centric, drink-heavy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A big weekend night out for Jack usually begins with pre-drinks at someone's house - perhaps a bottle of gin mixed with tonic shared between him and three friends - before going on to a club for shots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even though he sometimes drinks a considerable amount, Jack, who works in advertising, says he knows his limits and feels healthy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a pretty fit person, I ran a marathon a year ago,\" he says. \"As long as you know what your limits are, I think its fine, health-wise.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jack outside a bar on Drury Street in the centre of Dublin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three-quarters of the population here drink and celebrations, from birthdays to weddings, often involve alcohol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumption has fallen by around a third over the past 25 years, according to figures from The Drinks Industry Group of Ireland (DIGI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Young people, on average, now start drinking at 17 - two years older than the average 20 years ago. But once they start, their consumption and binge drinking is among the highest in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A report from public health advocacy group Alcohol Action Ireland found the proportion of 15-24-year-olds consuming alcohol had risen - from 66% in 2018, to 75% in 2024 - and that two out of three 15-24-year-olds regularly binge-drink.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Campaigners believe Ireland's alcohol warning labels are making an incremental impact. But 23-year-old Amanda, who's seen the labels, isn't so sure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You look at it and you're like, 'Oh, I just drank that. Should I drink another one?'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll be</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down.

It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drink</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life?

While some branches have reopened since a ceasefire took effect seven weeks ago, there are still no working ATMs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But people need cash to buy food and essentials. That has forced them to turn to informal money merchants who charge enormous commissions to turn digital transfers into cash. It has also sparked a huge increase in the use of e-wallets and money transfer apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it means that every existing banknote matters more than ever - no matter how tattered. That's where Baraa comes in. \"My tools are simple: a ruler, pencils, coloured pencils and glue,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ceasefire hasn't changed the financial situation.

For those without accounts, The Bank of Palestine offers e-wallets and says there are now more than 500,000 users in Gaza. These transactions can be done without an internet connection or app, using text services on any mobile phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">E-wallets are being used to send financial aid directly to needy families, by humanitarian agencies including Unicef and the World Food Programme.

It prioritises vulnerable children, including amputees and orphans, and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Basically, you can go to the grocery store and the phone is used as a payment card, you can buy with it,\" explains Jonathan Crickx from Unicef. \"That allows a very high traceability of how the money is actually spent. From what we observed, 99% of all beneficiaries are spending first on food and water, second is hygiene items, like soap, and third is electricity through generators.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Crickx says he has personally witnessed families having to buy 2kg (4.4lb) of tomatoes for about $80, and 5kg (11lb) of onions for $70.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hanan Abu Jahel, who is displaced from Gaza City and lives in a camp in al-Zawaideh in central Gaza with her extended family, recently received 1,200 shekels ($367) from Unicef.
