from the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was the 100th homicide recorded in Washington DC this year, according to local media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Police say the

precaution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to crime figures published by Washington DC's Metropolitan Police, violent offences peaked in 2023 and fell 35% last year to their lowest level in three decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But DC Police Union chairman Gregg Pemberton has disputed those figures, previously accusing the city police department of \"deliberately

made up of the eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk - has been partly occupied by Russia since 2014.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moscow now holds almost all of Luhansk and about 70% of Donetsk but speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Zelensky reaffirmed that Ukraine would reject any proposal to leave the Donbas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If we withdraw from the Donbas today - our fortifications, our terrain, the heights we control - we will clearly open a bridgehead for the Russians to prepare an offensive,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky has previously insisted that Ukrainians would not \"gift their land to the occupier\", and pointed to the country's constitution, which requires a referendum before a change in its territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his nightly address on Tuesday, Zelensky also said Moscow was preparing new offensives on three parts of the front - Zaporizhzhia, Pokrovsk and Novopavlov areas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week Trump said there would be \"some swapping of territories to the betterment of both\" Russia and Ukraine - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clyrlvwx9rgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">sparking concern in Kyiv and across Europe</a> that Moscow could be allowed to redraw Ukraine's borders by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia currently controls just under 20% of Ukrainian territory.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House on Tuesday said the Alaska talks would be a \"listening exercise\" for Trump and added having him and Putin sit down in the same room would give the US president \"the best indication on how to end this war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It follows Trump describing the summit as a \"feel-out meeting\" on Monday, seeming to tone down expectations that Friday's meeting could bring Ukraine and Russia closer to peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When he announced the summit last week, Trump sounded positive that the meeting could result in concrete steps towards peace. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think my gut instinct really tells me that we have a shot at it,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Ukrainian President Zelensky once again expressed serious doubts that the talks could result in a positive outcome for Kyiv, which has been excluded from the summit. \"I don't know what they will talk about without us,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky has steered clear of criticising Trump but in recent days his frustration at being sidelined has become apparent, and on Tuesday he said the choice of Alaska as a location was a \"personal victory\" for Putin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He is coming out of isolation, because they are meeting with him on US territory,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Ukrainian leader has previously said any agreements without Kyiv's involvement would amount to \"dead decisions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, Zelensky is due to join a virtual meeting with Donald Trump, EU leaders, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Nato chief Mark Rutte. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">All sides will try to convince Trump of the need not to be swayed by Putin when the two meet at the hastily organised summit.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Israel denies there is starvation in Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has accused UN agencies of not picking up aid at the borders and delivering it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The joint statement also demanded an end to the use of lethal force near aid distribution sites and lorry convoys, where the UN says more than 1,300 Palestinians have been killed, mostly by the Israeli military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Separately, the World Health Organisation on Tuesday appealed to Israel to let it stock medical supplies to deal with a \"catastrophic\" health situation before it seizes control of Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We all hear about 'more humanitarian supplies are allowed in' - well it's not happening yet, or it's happening at a way too low a pace,\" said Rik Peeperkorn, the agency's representative in the Palestinian territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We want to as quickly stock up hospitals,\" he added. \"We currently cannot do that. We need to be able to get all essential medicines and medical supplies in.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's war cabinet voted on Monday to occupy Gaza City, a move condemned at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council later that day. On Tuesday the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was \"at the beginning of a new state of combat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli government has not provided an exact timetable on when its forces would enter the area. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's forces had been instructed to dismantle the \"two remaining Hamas strongholds\" in Gaza City and a central area around al-Mawasi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid in Gaza, including designating safe corridors for aid distribution, as well as more air drops by Israeli forces and other partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the ground, however, residents of Gaza City said they had come under unrelenting attack from the air. Majed al-Hosary, a resident in Zeitoun in Gaza City, told AFP that the attacks had been \"extremely intense for two days\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"With every strike, the ground shakes. There are martyrs under the rubble that no one can reach because the shelling hasn't stopped,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It sounded like the war was restarting,\" Amr Salah, 25, told Reuters. \"Tanks fired shells at houses, and several houses were hit, and the planes carried out what we call fire rings, whereby several missiles landed on some roads in eastern Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said that 100 dead had been brought to hospitals across Gaza over the past 24 hours, including 31 people who were killed at aid sites. Five more people had also died of malnutrition, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has faced mounting criticism over the 22-month-long war with Hamas, with UN-backed experts warning of widespread famine unfolding in the besieged territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Tuesday members of an international group of former leaders known as \"The Elders\" for the first time called the war in Gaza an \"unfolding genocide\" and blamed Israel for causing famine among its population. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Following a visit to the Gaza border, Helen Clark and Mary Robinson, a former prime minister of New Zealand and a former president of Ireland, said in a joint statement: \"What we saw and heard underlines our personal conviction that there is not only an unfolding, human-caused famine in Gaza. There is an unfolding genocide.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The statement mirrors those of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c776xkvz6vno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">leading Israeli rights groups</a>, including B'Tselem, which said it had reached an \"unequivocal conclusion\" that Israel was attempting to \"destroy Palestinian society in the Gaza Strip\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel strongly rejects the accusations, saying its forces target terrorists and never civilians, and that Hamas was responsible for the suffering in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Sunday, the IDF killed <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqyyrp3yq9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">five Al Jazeera journalists</a> in a targeted attack on a media tent in Gaza City, sparking widespread international condemnation. It said it had killed well known reporter Anas al-Sharif, whom it alleged \"served as the head of a terrorist cell in Hamas\", and made no mention of the others. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Media freedom groups said it had provided little evidence for its claims. Al Jazeera's managing editor said Israel wanted to \"silence the coverage of any channel of reporting from inside Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas killed more than 1,200 people and took 251 hostage in its attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. Israel's response in Gaza has killed at least 61,599 Palestinians, according to the health ministry, whose toll the UN considers reliable.</p></div></div></body></html>"

from goods and services to contracts for public works such as roads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some 40,000 high-value tenders worth £38bn from federal ministries will now be open to bidding for UK businesses in strategic sectors like transport, green energy and infrastructure - areas which have thus far been heavily protected from foreign competition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The access is unprecedented, trade experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is \"far greater\" than what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates and \"sets a new benchmark\", Ajay Srivastava of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the agreement, UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated almost on par with Indian suppliers and also have real-time access to information on forthcoming public tenders and procurement opportunities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also, goods from the UK made with just 20% domestic input can now be supplied to the Indian government, allowing UK companies the flexibility to source up to 80% of the parts or raw material from other countries and still qualify for procurement preference in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minimum contract value at which these firms can bid for government projects has also been sharply reduced as a result of which \"UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects - such as rural roads, solar equipment for schools, or IT systems for government offices - that were previously out of reach\", said Mr Srivastava.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A rural village mud road in Purulia district, West Bengal flanked by fields and coconut trees. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects such as rural roads</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But for British companies, realising this opportunity on the ground will be easier said than done, several experts told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While UK suppliers are eligible to participate as Class-II local suppliers, Indian companies will continue to get preferential treatment as Class-I suppliers, says Dr Arpita Mukherjee, a trade expert with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moreover, pricing plays a key role in winning contracts, and \"UK companies tend to have higher prices\" compared with Indian companies, which will be a major challenge for them, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A more significant deterrent will be delayed payments and difficult contract enforcement, which are \"major legacy issues when it comes to public procurement in India\", says Srijan Shukla of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He says a study on procurement by India's central public sector enterprises from 2017 to 2020 found that pending payments to suppliers were often more than the total average procurement in a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This will impact UK players trying to enter India's public procurement markets, especially when it comes to public contracts that have long-time horizons and are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties,\" Mr Shukla told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pending dues have been a major irritant for India's small businesses too, leading to short-term liquidity issues that often \"force them out of these procurement markets and reallocate that business to the big players\", according to Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Much of this is reflected in India's poor ranking - 163 out of 190 - on contract enforcement in the World Bank's Doing Business report, the latest round of which was in 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things have improved since these rankings were published - with one-stop-shop portals like Government e-Marketplace, the Central Public Procurement Portal or the recently launched online dispute resolution portal bringing more transparency to the public tendering process - payment discipline by government entities continues to remain a challenge, says Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Ms Mukherjee, the India-UK trade agreement emphasises transparency in procurement but omits issues like pending dues, contract enforcement and penalties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She adds the deal excludes the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement's dispute settlement provisions for four years after the CETA takes effect - these provisions usually define how disputes are resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Doing business in India is an acquired skill. Over time, companies from the UK will have to learn the way to work around complexities regarding the art of winning public tenders and navigating though complex regulations,\" Mr Shukla says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman worker with a headscarf, wearing a maroon tunic, handles a sheet of processed leather at a tannery in Jalandhar, Punjab, India,. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">India's public procurement market has long been reserved for local small and medium enterprises</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite the niggling issues, allowing foreign players entry into India's government procurement market marks a far-reaching policy shift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It shows the Indian government's intentions to open up a space that has long been reserved for local small and medium enterprises, and could be reflective of the concessions Delhi is willing to give foreign players in future trade agreements like <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz71w1dgl84o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the one being negotiated with the US</a>, according to GTRI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India is late to including deep government procurement clauses in trade deals, making its current efforts a catch-up game, says Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is also a sign, he says, of the Indian government's \"confidence that its own firms can compete with global firms both externally and at home\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The hope is that more foreign players will force more accountability from the Indian government and \"help standardise\" its tendering and public procurement process - marked by payment delays and poor contract enforcement - to global standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It preys on the vulnerable and benefits those who seek to profit from abuse and exploitation,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/689b4b9beb300a86d83d0c34/Service_Inquiry_to_investigate_the_circumstances_surrounding_alleged_unacceptable_behaviour_by_UK_Service_Personnel_in_Kenya_in_contravention_of_MoD_and_Army_policy_on_Sexual_Exploitati.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">The service inquiry investigation</a> was carried out by a panel of four people, including two serving officers, a civil servant and an independent adviser.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It investigated the behaviour of troops stationed at Batuk and assessed the army's systems to prevent breaches of its regulation JSP 769 which bans soldiers from paying for sex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report details 35 instances in which Batuk soldiers were suspected to have paid for sex, since guidance for soldiers on the rule was published in July 2022. During that period 7,666 British soldiers served at the base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It notes that of those, 26 cases happened before training on the new rule was initiated for all army staff in November of that year, with nine reported cases since then. In the majority of cases, the allegation that soldiers had paid for sex was never proven.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to those detailed in the report, the Foreign Office told the BBC there was a small number - less than five - cases of alleged use of sex workers currently under investigation. The alleged incidents happened after the inquiry was concluded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report said that despite the training given by the Army and the control measures in place, the reality was that \"transactional sexual activity\" by UK personnel in Kenya was still happening, and that \"the level is somewhere between low and moderate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is not out of control, but the best way for the Army to manage the risk is for the Army to assume it may be at the upper end of that scale between low and moderate,\" the report added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report noted efforts by the Army to stamp out the practice, including regular training and the use of \"sharkwatch\" patrols with a non-commissioned officer of the rank of sergeant or above deployed to monitor the conduct of junior personnel when they left the base for nights out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The army said it would implement recommendations from the report, including making it easier to dismiss soldiers found to have used sex workers and the implementation of additional training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report follows years of controversy about the conduct of soldiers at Batuk sparked by an investigation by the Sunday Times in 2021 which revealed the alleged involvement of a British soldier in the murder of Ms Wanjiru, a mother of one whose body was found dumped in a septic tank near a hotel where she had been seen with soldiers on the night she vanished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Separately in Kenya,  MPs have been conducting an inquiry into wider allegations of mistreatment of local people by soldiers at Batuk and have heard claims at public hearings of injuries allegedly sustained through the behaviour of British troops and of soldiers fathering children to Kenyan mothers and then abandoning them when they returned home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June this year a soldier stationed at the base was sent back to the UK after being accused of rape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Service Inquiry behind the latest report said it had spoken to many local Kenyans and found \"the vast majority\" of local residents were happy with the presence of the Batuk camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

The US is offering $5m (£3.7m) for information leading to his arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The group has been accused of multiple murders, kidnappings and attacks on infrastructure.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's a good reason that there's a $5m reward for information leading to Cherizier's arrest,\" US Attorney Jeanine Pirro said at a news conference on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He's a gang leader responsible for heinous human rights abuses, including violence against American citizens in Haiti.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prosecutors say he is suspected of playing a key role in the 2018 La Saline massacre, in which 71 people were killed, more than 400 houses were destroyed, and at least seven women raped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Richardson, who was arrested in Texas last month, is a naturalised US citizen who grew up in Haiti, prosecutors say. He was residing in North Carolina before he was taken into custody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also known as Fredo, Fred Lion, Leo Danger, and Lepe Blode, he helped raise funds that were then used to pay gang leaders and purchase weapons, according to officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both men helped \"bankroll Cherizier's violent criminal enterprise, which is driving a security crisis in Haiti\", said Assistant US Attorney General John Eisenberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that the US \"will continue to pursue those who enable Haiti's violence and instability\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, US officials designated Viv Ansanm, which has controlled the capital since around 2020, as a foreign terrorist organisation. Earlier this year, the group announced that it was declaring itself a political party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to the US, Mr Cherizier is also under sanctions from the United Nations,  Canada and Britain, which accuse him of fueling violence in Haiti. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If arrested, he could be extradited to the US. However, he remains in a position of significant power on the streets and is protected by his group's members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then the country - the poorest in the Americas - has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control and increasingly violent gang warfare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent months, a UN backed Kenyan led security force has failed to take back control of the Haitian capital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in the country has sunk to new levels. UN reports estimate that 5.7 million people – more than half of Haiti's population – are facing acute food insecurity and there are over one million internally displaced people.</p></div></div></body></html>"

At night the lights are turned out and they work in the dark, with little safety equipment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The escapees told us that the workers are confined to their construction sites day and night, where they are watched by agents from North Korea's state security department.

Then in 2019, the UN banned countries from using these workers in an attempt to cut off Kim's funds and stop him building nuclear weapons, meaning most were sent home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But last year more than 10,000 labourers were sent to Russia, according to a South Korean intelligence official speaking to the BBC on the condition of anonymity. They told us that even more were expected to arrive this year, and in total Pyongyang would eventually dispatch more than 50,000 workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sudden influx means North Korean workers are now \"everywhere in Russia,\" the official added. While most are working on large-scale construction projects, others have been assigned to clothing factories and IT centres, they said, in violation of the UN sanctions banning the use of North Korean labour.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fedstat.ru/indicator/38479\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Russian government figures show</a> that more than 13,000 North Koreans entered the country in 2024, a 12-fold increase from the previous year. Nearly 8,000 of them entered on student visas but, according to the intelligence official and experts, this is a tactic used by Russia to bypass the UN ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June, a senior Russian official, Sergei Shoigu, admitted for the first time that 5,000 North Koreans would be sent to rebuild Kursk, a Russian region seized by Ukrainian forces last year but who have since been pushed back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The South Korean official told us it was also \"highly likely\" some North Koreans would soon be deployed to work on reconstruction projects in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Russia is suffering a severe labour shortage right now and North Koreans offer the perfect solution.

Most workers go hoping to escape poverty and be able to buy a house for their family or start a business when they return. Only the most trusted men are selected after being rigorously vetted, and they must leave their families behind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the bulk of their earnings is sent straight to the North Korean state as \"loyalty fees\". The remaining fraction – usually between $100-200 (£74-£149) a month  - is marked down on a ledger. The workers only receive this money when they return home – a recent tactic, experts say, to stop them running away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Once the men realise the reality of the harsh work and lack of pay, it can be shattering. Tae said he was \"ashamed\" when he learnt that other construction workers from central Asia were being paid five times more than him for a third of the work. \"I felt like I was in a labour camp; a prison without bars,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The labourer Jin still bristles when he remembers how the other workers would call them slaves. \"You are not men, just machines that can speak,\" they jeered. At one point, Jin's manager told him he might not receive any money when he returned to North Korea because the state needed it instead. It was then he decided to risk his life to escape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tae made the decision to defect after watching YouTube videos showing how much workers in South Korea were paid. One night, he packed his belongings into a bin liner, stuffed a blanket under his bed sheets to make it look as if he was still sleeping, and crept out of his construction site. He hailed a taxi and travelled thousands of kilometres across the country to meet a lawyer who helped arrange his journey on to Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent years, a small number of workers have been able to orchestrate their escapes using forbidden second-hand smartphones, bought by saving the small daily allowance they received for cigarettes and alcohol.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A handful of labourers have managed to escape Russia during the war and reach Seoul</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In an attempt to prevent these escapes, multiple sources have told us that the North Korean authorities are now cracking down on workers' already limited freedom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Prof Kang from Dong-A University, one way the regime has tried to control the workers over the last year is by subjecting them to more frequent ideological training and self-criticism sessions, in which they are forced to declare their loyalty to Kim Jong Un and log their failings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare opportunities to leave construction sites have also been cut. \"The workers used to go out in groups once a month, but recently these trips have reduced to almost zero,\" Prof Kang added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kim Seung-chul, a Seoul-based activist who helps rescue North Korean workers from Russia, said these outings were being more tightly controlled. \"They used to be allowed to leave in pairs, but since 2023 they have had to travel in groups of five and are monitored more intensely.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In this climate, fewer workers are managing to escape. The South Korean government told us the number of North Koreans making it out of Russia each year and arriving in Seoul had halved since 2022 - from around 20 a year to just 10.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Lankov, the expert in North Korea-Russia relations, said the crackdowns were likely in preparation for many more workers arriving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These workers will be the lasting legacy of Kim and Putin's wartime friendship,\" he said, arguing the workers would continue arriving long after the war had ended, and the deployment of soldiers and weapons had ceased.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jake-kwon-and-hosu-lee\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Will the gamble pay off? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. \"It's day to day,\" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,\" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why rare earths matter</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The phrase \"rare earths\" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors  - is something of a misnomer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,\" Professor Eksteen explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windshield wipers and breaking sensors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact \"somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck\", Professor Eksteen adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,\" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,\" Professor Eksteen explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,\" says Mr McGrath.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The Australian government sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,\" Mr McGrath says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A strategic necessity</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies – making their control a pressing national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn't exist. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,\" Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,\" Ms King adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry – pollution.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Labourers work at the site of a rare earth metals mine at Nancheng county, Jiangxi province\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Critics say China's environmental protections and regulations are weak</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In China, environmental damage from years of processing rare earths has led to chemicals and radioactive waste seeping into waterways - cities and people bearing the scars of decades of poor regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With rare earths, it's not so much about the mining footprint, rather the processing that is a dirty business – because it involves extraction, leaching, thermal cracking and refining which produce radioactive components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think there is no metal industry that is completely clean... unfortunately, it's a matter of picking your poison sometimes,\" Professor Eksteen says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Australia, we've got mechanisms to handle that.

In a post on Instagram he described Qreiqeh as having a \"very calm\" soul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cameraman Ibrahim Zaher, 25, was also from Jabalia, according to Al Jazeera. Bader said he had been a journalist from the beginning of the war, while also volunteering with medical services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cameraman Moamen Aliwa was described as \"friendly, helpful, kind, polite\" by Bader. He wrote on Instagram Aliwa had originally studied engineering but during the war became a journalist. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammed Noufal, described as both a cameraman and crew driver by Al Jazeera, was also from Jabalia. The news outlet said the 29-year-old's mother and brother were killed by Israeli attacks earlier in the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Freelance journalist Mohammed al-Khaldi posted a number of videos on social media documenting his life and that of others in war-torn Gaza.

Israel has previously denied targeting journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He described this as a \"longstanding pattern\" and referred to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-63871856\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the Israeli military's killing of veteran Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Aqla</a>, who was shot in the head during an Israeli army raid in the occupied West Bank in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military concluded that one of its soldiers probably killed her, but called her death unintentional. Al Jazeera said its evidence showed it was a \"deliberate killing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Here is a crucial fact: had Israel been held accountable for Shireen's assassination, it would not have dared to kill 200 journalists in Gaza,\" said Fakih.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sharif knew he risked being targeted by Israel after its Arabic-language spokesman posted a video of him in July and accused him of being a member of Hamas' military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a post published on his X account, which was prewritten in the event of his death, Sharif said he \"gave every effort and all my strength to be a support and a voice for my people...

Those born here can apply for passports if a parent was born in India between 1950 and 1987 -  but must surrender the certificate to do so. Many hesitate, as it's closely tied to their Tibetan identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July, as the Dalai Lama turned 90, thousands of Tibetan Buddhists gathered in Dharamshala - a quiet town nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas in the north Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. The town serves as the headquarters of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) - the Tibetan government-in-exile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even as they prayed for their leader's long life, many like Mr Tsundue found themselves reflecting on the uncertainty of living in exile. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The emotional weight of displacement, the legal limbo of statelessness and geopolitics around the Dalai Lama hung heavy on the birthday celebrations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5213/live/3bfdf8e0-6c57-11f0-8986-e507bff11528.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Sandeep Yadav/BBC The Dalai Lama seen on stage with several people as devotees watch.

He now lives with his son and wife in a  neighbourhood largely inhabited by Tibetans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For many like Mr Sangbo, fleeing to India may have provided security - but they still yearn for their homeland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A home is a home, after all,\" says Pasang Gyalpo, who fled Tibet to Nepal before settling in India in 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Five years later, Mr Gyalpo bribed Nepalese guards and slipped into Tibet to bring his family to India.

India-focused datasets will hopefully one day give people developing AI-based models the tools to make it much easier to adapt them for the entire population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently, designing any AI programme to deal with complex processes such as healthcare can be extremely challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kshitij Jadhav, an associate professor at the Koita Centre for Digital Health at IIT Mumbai, is working on an AI programme which would help people quit smoking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explains that people at different stages of the process need different advice and they usually need a well-trained human to make that assessment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are a limited number of practitioners who can help, particularly those that can operate in multiple languages, so Professor Jadhav is hoping his AI model can bridge the gap. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The AI \"will first identify the kind of conversation the person needs and accordingly will frame questions, show empathy, emotions,\" says Professor Jadhav.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And all that, hopefully, will eventually be done in 22 languages. Initial experiments are underway in English and Hindi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will be very customized, it will not be something just off the shelf,\" he says.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back on the streets of the city, Vineet Sawant has increased the number of parcels he delivers from ten to around 30 a day, helped in part by the translation function in the delivery app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He thinks it will help more people like him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It makes us feel like we belong.

It has led to a growing number of such providers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The development comes amid China's sluggish economy and jobs market. Chinese youth unemployment remains stubbornly high, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/youth-unemployment-rate\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">at more than 14%.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With real jobs increasingly hard to come by, some young adults would rather pay to go into an office than be just stuck at home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shui Zhou, 30, had a food business venture that failed in 2024. In April of this year, he started to pay 30 yuan ($4.20; £3.10) per day to go into a mock-up office run by a business called Pretend To Work Company, in the city of Dongguan, 114 km (71 miles) north of Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There he joins five \"colleagues\" who are doing the same thing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I feel very happy,\" says Mr Zhou. \"It's like we're working together as a group.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such operations are now appearing in major cities across China, including Shenzhen, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Kunming. More often they look like fully-functional offices, and are equipped with computers, internet access, meeting rooms, and tea rooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And rather than attendees just sitting around, they can use the computers to search for jobs, or to try to launch their own start-up businesses. Sometimes the daily fee, usually between 30 and 50 yuan, includes lunch, snacks and drinks.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Attendees can either just sit around, or use the provided computers to apply for jobs</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Christian Yao, a senior lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Management in New Zealand, is an expert on the Chinese economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The phenomenon of pretending to work is now very common,\" he says. \"Due to economic transformation and the mismatch between education and the job market, young people need these places to think about their next steps, or to do odd jobs as a transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Pretend office companies are one of the transitional solutions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou came across the Pretend To Work Company while browsing social media site Xiaohongshu. He says he felt that the office environment would improve his self-discipline. He has now been there for more than three months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou sent photos of the office to his parents, and he says they feel much more at ease about his lack of employment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While attendees can arrive and leave whenever they want, Mr Zhou usually gets to the office between 8am and 9am. Sometimes he doesn't leave until 11pm, only departing after the manager of the business has left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that the other people there are now like friends. He says that when someone is busy, such as job hunting, they work hard, but when they have free time they chat, joke about, and play games. And they often have dinner together after work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou says that he likes this team building, and that he is much happier than before he joined.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Shanghai, Xiaowen Tang rented a workstation at a pretend work company in Shanghai for a month earlier this year. The 23-year-old graduated from university last year and hasn't found a full-time job yet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her university has an unwritten rule that students must sign an employment contract or provide proof of internship within one year of graduation; otherwise, they won't receive a diploma.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She sent the office scene to the school as proof of her internship. In reality, she paid the daily fee, and sat in the office writing online novels to earn some pocket money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you're going to fake it, just fake it to the end,\" says Ms Tang.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Biao Xiang, director of the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology in Germany, says that China's pretending to work trend comes from a \"sense of frustration and powerlessness\" regarding a lack of job opportunities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Pretending to work is a shell that young people find for themselves, creating a slight distance from mainstream society and giving themselves a little space.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The owner of the Pretend To Work Company in the city of Dongguan is 30-year-old Feiyu (a pseudonym). \"What I'm selling isn't a workstation, but the dignity of not being a useless person,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He himself has been unemployed in the past, after a previous retail business that he owned had to close during the Covid pandemic. \"I was very depressed and a bit self-destructive,\" he recalls. \"You wanted to turn the tide, but you were powerless.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In April of this year he started to advertise Pretend To Work, and within a month all the workstations were full. Would-be new joiners have to apply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feiyu say that 40% of customers are recent university graduates who come to take photos to prove their internship experience to their former tutors. While a small number of them come to help deal with pressure from their parents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The other 60% are freelancers, many of whom are digital nomads, including those working for big ecommerce firms, and cyberspace writers. The average age is around 30, with the youngest being 25.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Feiyu, the owner of Pretend to Work Company says he is selling people \"dignity\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Officially, these workers are referred to as \"flexible employment professionals\", a grouping that also includes ride-hailing and trucker drivers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the longer term Feiyu says it is questionable whether the business will remain profitable. Instead he likes to view it more as a social experiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It uses lies to maintain respectability, but it allows some people to find the truth,\" he says. \"If we only help users prolong their acting skills we are complicit in a gentle deception.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Only by helping them transform their fake workplace into a real starting point can this social experiment truly live up to its promise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Zhou is now spending most of his time improving his AI skills. He says he's noticed that some companies are specifying proficiency in AI tools when recruiting. So he thinks gaining such AI skills \"will make it easier\" for him to find a full-time job.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 gMiqnK iuHqSH\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 jdmgui\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's part of a pioneering summer camp for a very special group of Ukrainian children, those with a parent who has disappeared during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some are soldiers missing in action on the front line, presumed dead. Some are in captivity or trapped in occupied areas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Ukrainian government says more than 70,000 people are officially listed as missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The charity that runs the camp, Gen.Ukrainian, helps thousands of traumatised children across Ukraine and runs several summer camps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is the first for this category of children, and the BBC was given exclusive access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Many of these children have multiple traumas because not only are their fathers missing, but some of them have uncles and grandmothers missing too,\" explains Vanui Martirosyan, lead psychologist at the charity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're living like in a frozen state.

The channels often contain violent content related to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They feel fear of crying, they think that if they start crying it will continue for forever. This type of trauma is maybe the most difficult to work with.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The day after the campfire meeting, I speak to Dima, who wants to tell me more about his dad.

I realised I wouldn't see my dad for a while.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">For many of the children the camp is an opportunity to escape the constant threat of missile strikes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During all our interviews with the children, including with Dima, a Gen.Ukrainian psychologist was present.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I kept hoping until the end that Dad is a prisoner of war somewhere. Even now I still hope,\" Dima says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dima's trauma only intensified after his mum began to look into the circumstances of his dad's disappearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Initially she was told by the military that her husband was missing following an airstrike on his position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Then someone else called mum, the chief of something-or-other, and said the Russians shot everyone, and someone saw Dad's body lying there without any legs. Then another soldier who was at Dad's position said they saw him dead, with shrapnel wounds to the head.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dima says the effect on both him and his mother was profound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mum cried a lot because of that. I supported her,\" Dima says. \"When Dad left, he said, 'Dima, no matter what happens you must look after Mum because you're a man, and you're her son.\"'</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Group therapy at the camp takes place daily, held in small rooms. We are allowed to observe the start of one of the sessions - the rest is confidential.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One psychologists, Olena, shows a colour chart to the children, used to describe emotions. Green is happy, blue is sad, yellow is anxious or overstimulated, and red is anger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, they'll be discussing sadness. The more unpleasant and sad we feel, says Olena, the more we love the people we are sad about. That shows these people are important to us.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Camp psychologists say physical exercise such as hiking heals trauma, triggering hormones and reducing stress</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The children are encouraged to express their feelings, including through art. At an art therapy session, many of the paintings show happy families, houses and pets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One seven-year-old boy, Zahar, tells me his painting is called \"Daddy comes home.\" It shows yellow stick men in front of a blue sky - the colours of the Ukrainian flag.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the children live in cities that come under near-constant bombardment by Russian drones and missiles. Like 16-year-old Nastia's hometown of Kharkiv, in the north-east of Ukraine, close to the frontline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If there's bombing nearby, I go and shelter in the corridor. I worry and stress a lot,\" Nastia says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her father was also a soldier. He disappeared around a year ago on the frontline. She last saw him two weeks before he went missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I ask her what memories of your father she has and her eyes glisten.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He was very kind, he spoilt me a lot. He had a sweet tooth like me, and always knew what treats to buy me,\" Nastia says. \"I remember only the good things about Dad. The only sad thing I remember is that he disappeared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I love him very much and I know he loves me too,\" she continues, adding, \"I hope we can make new memories with him again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This camp also offers the kids a chance to catch up on sleep, uninterrupted by air-raid sirens - and to just have fun and play. There are regular trips to the swimming pool, hikes and games of volleyball.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's important for the body to make movements in order to heal the trauma,\" explains head psychologist Vanui.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The therapy helps traumatised children understand that they are not alone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the camp closing ceremony, it's time for the children and staff to say goodbye.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One boy, Ilya, is in floods of tears - he doesn't want to go home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have a child like this in every camp,\" smiles Oksana Lebedieva, the founder of Gen.Ukrainian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She points to the throngs of children playing in the garden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Maybe for the first time in their lives, they've found people who went through the same experience. And it's very important. Group therapy is more important than anything - to see you're not alone with the pain.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oksana says the scale of the task facing her charity is overwhelming. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Millions of Ukrainian children are traumatised by war.

We are in a transitional phase,\" acknowledged Nahid Islam, a student leader who helped spearhead the protests and acted as an adviser to the interim government until recently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Islam agrees there are challenges facing the country, but dismisses concerns of growing Islamist influence, saying it was \"part of a broader cultural struggle\" that has existed for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are also signs of progress. Many credit the interim government with stabilising the country's economy and, contrary to fears, the banking sector has survived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bangladesh has met its loan obligations, kept food prices largely stable, and maintained robust foreign exchange reserves - currently at $30bn (£22bn) - thanks to remittances and international loans. Exports have also held steady.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there are other, less easily measurable things.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Islam argues that, since the fall of Hasina, \"a democratic environment has been established, and now everyone can express their views freely\". That is something to be celebrated in a country shaped by a history of political turbulence, military coups, assassinations, and bitter rivalries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that is being questioned by some.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The influence of student leaders over the interim government has drawn criticism. They were given the roles in recognition for their leadership in the unprecedented protests which toppled Hasina.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, two remain in the cabinet, and critics say some controversial decisions, such as the temporary ban on the Awami League, were made under student pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The government has at times complied with some of the populist demands, particularly by the students, fearing more threatening protests could otherwise erupt. However, that was the exception rather than the rule,\" Mr Bergman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, an exiled leader from the Awami League alleges that the party's supporters are being silenced by not being allowed to contest the next poll - with most of its leaders in exile or in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The elections will not be inclusive without the participation of the Awami League,\" Mohammad Ali Arafat, former minister in Hasina's cabinet, tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its latest report, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/authoritarian-system-yet-be-taken-apart-39\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) said there had been an alarming rise in mob violence</a> while extra-judicial killings and deaths in custody had persisted in the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have overthrown an authoritarian regime, but unless we put an end to the authoritarian practices, we cannot really create a new Bangladesh,\" Iftekhar Zaman, the executive director of the TIB, said during the launch of the report earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Bangladesh stands at a crossroads, the next six months will be critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some argue that, if there are no meaningful changes to the chequered political system, the sacrifices of those killed in the uprising could be rendered meaningless. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Symbols like the Celtic harp and the Shamrock are seen by many as belonging to both traditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a complex and evolving set of choices, with frequent arguments. Promotion of the Irish language is bitterly opposed by a vocal section of Unionism. For most Catholics their Irish identity was historically something to be defended in a Unionist dominated state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was an identity that helped bind them to their co-religionists on the rest of the island, particularly in the fields of Gaelic sport and culture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But as politics has changed there is less preoccupation with religious background, a greater sense of belonging to an international culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And this is without even beginning to speak of an identity that is demonstrably northern Irish with its shared dry humour.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Everyone has their own menu of what being \"culturally Irish\" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It can also mean a sense of a particular landscape, either one you loved, or were glad to escape - or for second or third - generation Irish, a landscape of brief immersion on summer holidays from England. That was the world of \"the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting\" evoked by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are as many definitions of \"culturally Irish\" as there are Irish people, or people who want to be Irish.

I am also a Cork, Kerry and Waterford person. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Fergal Keane today, alongside a photo of him as an aspiring young folk singer back in Limerick in the 1980s</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1lpvn6369po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">The Irish language </a>and music is an essential part of my cultural makeup. But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: \"And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. Identity is also a story of deep and loving relationships, whether in Ireland, London, the African continent or France, to name but three important ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My feelings about identity are also inextricably linked to my experiences as a war reporter. I spent too many years witnessing ethnic cleansing, genocide and crimes against humanity often carried out because of hatred of a different identity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The great writer, James Joyce, rejected any identity built around \"nationality, language, religion\" and defiantly vowed to \"fly by those nets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was writing about a different, much narrower Ireland of the early 20th century. But the policing of identity – who you are allowed to be - is disturbingly present in many societies, and many guises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, if somebody asks me to narrow my identity to a single label, I refuse, because it is mine, not to be explained or justified. And if it shifts tomorrow, that is my business.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'The old battle of identities is far from finished'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The nature of identity is evolving - in Ireland it is absorbing the influences of other cultures, but also influencing those cultures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professor Nic Dháibhéid hopes the prominence of Irish cultural identities in Britain will prompt a greater interest in the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly among the under-25s who, as she sees it, \"will have no memory of the Troubles, and so there is an even greater need to ensure that there is good mutual understanding between the people on our two islands.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The big British <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly290dk226o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">audiences for Kneecap,</a> to take an example, didn't happen because young people had a sudden awakening about the problems of life in nationalist west Belfast.

Now, they fuel her fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Between 2018 and 2024, those panels were installed at Rubí and Clemesí, two massive solar plants in Peru's Moquegua region, about 1,000 kilometres south of the capital, Lima. Together, they form the country's largest solar complex – and one of the biggest in Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From her home in the small settlement of Pampa Clemesí, Rosa can see the rows of panels glowing under white floodlights. The Rubí plant is just 600 metres away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet her home – and the rest of her village – remains in total darkness, unconnected to the grid the plant feeds into.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The Rubí solar plant can be seen from various spots throughout the town</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Power from the sun, but not at home</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">None of Pampa Clemesí's 150 residents have access to the national power grid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few have solar panels donated by Rubí's operator, Orygen, but most can't afford the batteries and converters needed to make them work. At night, they use torches – or simply live in the dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The paradox is striking: the Rubí solar power plant produces around 440 GWh a year, enough to supply electricity to 351,000 homes. Moquegua, where the plant is located, is an ideal site for solar energy, receiving over 3,200 hours of sunshine annually, more than most countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that contradiction becomes even sharper in a country currently experiencing a renewable energy boom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2024 alone, electricity generation from renewables grew by 96%. Solar and wind power depend heavily on copper due to its high conductivity – and Peru is the world's second-largest producer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Peru, the system was designed around profitability. No effort was made to connect sparsely populated areas,\" explains Carlos Gordillo, an energy expert at the University of Santa María in Arequipa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Orygen says it has fulfilled its responsibilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've joined the government project to bring electricity to Pampa Clemesí and have already built a dedicated line for them. We also completed the first phase of the electrification project, with 53 power towers ready to operate,\" Marco Fragale, Orygen's executive director in Peru, told BBC News Mundo, the BBC's Spanish-language service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fragale adds that nearly 4,000 metres of underground cable were installed to provide a power line for the village. The $800,000 investment is complete, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the lights still haven't come on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The final step – connecting the new line to individual homes – is the government's responsibility. According to the plan, the Ministry of Mines and Energy must lay about two kilometres of wiring. Work was slated to begin in March 2025, but hasn't started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">BBC News Mundo tried to contact the Ministry of Mines and Energy but received no response.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Residents gather for dinner in darkness, illuminated only by a solar-powered torch</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A daily struggle for basics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rosa's tiny house has no sockets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each day, she walks around the village, hoping someone can spare a bit of electricity to charge her phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's essential,\" she says, explaining she needs the device to stay in touch with her family near the border with Bolivia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the few people who can help is Rubén Pongo.

A layer of dust settles on the lampposts on the main plaza, waiting to be installed.

But as the economy has waned post-Pandemic - and with multiple trade wars on the horizon - the market may be drying up.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the whiskey, which is traditionally made with corn and aged in charred oak barrels, has roots going all the way back to the 18th Century, it wasn't until 1964 that it became an iconic piece of Americana, when Congress passed a law declaring it a \"distinctive product of the United States\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But drinking trends come and go, and by the end of the 20th Century, bourbon was considered a bit old fashioned - pun intended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You often see these kind of generational shifts where people don't want to drink what their parents drink,\" said Marten Lodewijks, the US president of IWSR, which collects alcoholic beverage data and provides industry analysis. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then, as the world recovered from the 2008 recession, drinkers seemed to rediscover this classic spirit, for a few different reasons. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For starters, the price point was good, which made it attractive for bar managers to purchase and incorporate into cocktails and for younger drinkers to sample. Then, in 2013, a law was passed in Kentucky that made it easier for companies to purchase and resell vintage bottles, opening up a high-end collectible market. Add to that the rise in mid-century nostalgia fuelled by shows like Mad Men, and bourbon was due for a full-blown Renaissance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sales of bourbon grew by 7% worldwide between 2011-2020, which is more than three times the growth of the decade prior, according to industry data company IWSR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soon, some bourbon distillers were becoming quasi-celebrities, and people were starting to buy up bourbon bottles not to drink, but as an investment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Everyone was going crazy over the bourbon market, and treating like a commodity, like a stock,\" recalls Robin Wynne, a general manager and beverage director for Little Sister in Toronto, Canada, who has been a bar manager for about 25 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People would go in as a prospector, to flip bottles for two to three times the value.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But like most market bubbles, this one was bound to burst. The pandemic's lockdowns tanked bar sales, and inflation has made many would-be bourbon drinkers choose less expensive options - or forgo drinking all together. Amongst Gen-Z, many 20-somethings <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220920-why-gen-zers-are-growing-up-sober-curious\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">are drinking less</a> than their older siblings and parents did at their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those factors have contributed to declining alcohol sales, with bourbon sales specifically slowing down to just 2% between 2021-2024, according to IWSR data. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Donald Trump's global tariffs have been the final straw. The EU has announced retaliatory tariffs against US goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Californian wine, although implementation has been delayed for six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, most provinces in Canada have stopped importing American alcoholic beverages in retaliation. The country accounts for about 10% of Kentucky's $9bn (£6.7bn) whiskey and bourbon business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves ... that's a very disproportionate response,\" Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has said that tariffs will boost made-in-American businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Republican Senator Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, said the tariffs will hurt local businesses and consumers in his home state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it's always passed through as a cost. So, there will be higher prices,\" he told ABC's \"This Week\" in May.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A long wooden hall is flanked by stacks of wooden bourbon barrels on either side, with industrial lights illuminating the way\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">There are 86 distilleries in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association, and over 10 million barrels of bourbon aging </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These economic pressures have created a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Liquor giant Diageo, reported that sales of Bulleit, a Kentucky distillery that makes bourbon, rye and whiskey, where down 7.3% this fiscal year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wild Turkey - a Kentucky bourbon owned by Campari - sales were down 8.1% over the past six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While big, international brands will likely be able to weather the storm, the sales hit has led to a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July, LMD Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - just one month after opening the Luca Mariano Distillery in Danville, Kentucky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This spring, Garrard County Distilling went into receivership.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And in January, Jack Daniel's parent company closed a barrel-making plant in Kentucky.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The bottom of the barrel has not yet been reached, warned Mr Lodewijks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'd be extraordinarily surprised if there weren't more bankruptcies and more consolidation,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In part, bourbon has become a victim of its own success - the rise in bourbon sales, and the growth of the premium market, helped fuel many small distilleries. Because bourbon must age in barrels for years, what's on the market today was predicted a few years ago, which means that there is currently an oversupply, which is driving down prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while these economic conditions are harsh, Mr Lodewijks said that history has shown how tough times can create innovation. Scotch whisky used to be fairly simple, a blend of middle-of-the road tipples. But when sales declined in the second part of the 20th century, distillers started aging their excess bottles, which helped create the market we have now for premium, aged Scotch whisky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Canada, where bourbon imports have slowed to a trickle, local distilleries have started experimenting with bourbon-making methods to give Canadian whiskey a similar taste.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The tariff war has really done a positive for the Canadian spirits business,\" noted Mr Wynne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've got lots of grains to make these whiskeys without having to rely on the States.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But DeepSeek hasn't disappeared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DeepSeek challenged certain key assumptions about AI that had been championed by American executives like Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were on a path where bigger was considered better,\" according to Sid Sheth, CEO of AI chip startup d-Matrix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps maxing out on data centres, servers, chips, and the electricity to run it all wasn't the way forward after all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that \"with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The surge of interest in DeepSeek took hold over a weekend in late January, before corporate IT personnel could move to stop employees from flocking to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while exact numbers aren't available, plenty of Americans still use DeepSeek today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Certain Silicon Valley start-ups have opted to stick with DeepSeek in lieu of more expensive AI models from US firms in a bid to cut down on costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One investor told me for cash-strapped firms, funds saved by continuing to use DeepSeek are helping to pay for critical needs such as additional headcount. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are, however, being careful. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In online forums, users explain how to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-run-deepseek-r-1-locally\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices</a> rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China -

But years of migration to cities have shrunk families and turned places like Seoul into sprawling metropolises. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unaffordable housing, rising costs and gruelling working hours have led more and more young people to reject marriage or parenthood, or both.

But Seoul is not the first to do this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2018, the UK appointed a Minister for Loneliness.

The choice of name - \"convenience stores\" - was a deliberate attempt to distance them from psychiatric clinics, important in a country where there is still a stigma against asking for help for mental health - especially among older residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, some of their reservations can still be seen when they walk through the door for the first time, compounded by their experience of isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Visitors are often uncomfortable speaking to another person or eating together initially, store manager Lee says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The typical loneliness, if that repeats for days, months, and half year, that is now more than a feeling,\" Lee explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Those folks start to avoid places with people.

Added worries over pace ace Jasprit Bumrah's fitness further dimmed India's prospects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Losing the first Test at Headingley from a winning position, as England chased 373 in the fourth innings, confirmed pundits' doubts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But India recovered from this setback in style to win the next Test at Edgbaston by a whopping 336 runs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The swift turnaround came not from luck but skill and relentless determination - qualities that defined India's performance for the rest of the series.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The three Tests that followed were bitterly fought, both teams raising the intensity and skill levels, matching each other blow-for-blow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This sparked frequent heated clashes but also unforgettable acts of heroism, with players from both sides battling fatigue and injury to keep their teams in the fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some aspects of what kept India in the fight right through the neck-and-neck contest comes through in the stats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three batters - Gill, Rahul and Jadeja - topped 500 runs in the series. England had one, Joe Root. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were 12 centuries made by India, England had nine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammed Siraj with 23 was the highest wicket-taker from either side. The only bowler to take 10 wickets in a match was Akash Deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Failures were scant, heroes were plenty, but the pillars of India's extraordinary show in the series were Gill and Siraj.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gill, in Bradmanesque form, made 754 runs, 430 of them coming in one Test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He failed by a mere 20 runs to break Sunil Gavaskar's record series aggregate, and was also second to Don Bradman (810) for highest runs made in a series by a captain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To be mentioned alongside Bradman and Gavaskar testifies to Gill's achievement and potential. His prolific scoring earned his team's full respect, and after a hesitant start, he quickly grew in confidence, showing fine temperament and smart tactics in tough situations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images India's Akash Deep (L) and India's Yashasvi Jaiswal 2L) celebrate winning the final Test cricket match between England and India at The Oval in London on August 4, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The future looks rosy for the young Indian team</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj, who since his 2021 debut had lived in the shadows of Bumrah and Shami, emerged so spectacularly that he instantly entered cricket folklore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feisty and indefatigable, he bowled with a lion's heart - steaming in at full tilt, sparing his body no mercy, embracing the spearhead's role in Bumrah's absence, and inspiring the other pacers to bowl out of their skins - earning universal awe and admiration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj's 23 wickets came at an average of 32.43, with an economy rate of 4.02 and a strike rate of 48.43 - hardly earth-shattering figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In India's two victories, he was the decisive force. At Edgbaston, his six wickets in the first innings (seven overall) swung the match firmly in India's favour. At the Oval, he took nine wickets - four in the first innings and five in the second - turning the match on its head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">How India held their nerve for 25 days under immense pressure - driven by willpower, ambition, and skill - culminating in a thrilling final 56-minute comeback at the Oval to win and level the series, is one of Test cricket's most riveting tales.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also marked this Indian young team's transition from apprehension and misgivings one of rich promise fuelled by ambition and excellence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The future looks rosy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And when asked the following day whether he was giving Israel a \"green light\", he instead spoke about the US strikes on Iran earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Washington's Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was even more direct - and his answer was that Netanyahu's Gaza plan is not America's concern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" he said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has faced some opposition to his plan - notably from the Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had argued against a full-scale occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the event, an announcement after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet did not say Israel would take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, but rather that it would \"prepare for taking control of Gaza City\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It did, however, mention that one of five principles for ending the war was \"Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some have suggested a full takeover of Gaza has always been on the table. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Netanyahu had always planned to take over Gaza, he just was waiting for the right moment,\" Amin Saikal, emeritus professor of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has suggested Israel does not want to keep the territory, however, but \"hand it over to Arab forces\" - without specifying which. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the plan, however, the Trump administration is not giving Netanyahu any public indication that he is wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That represents a marked change in White House policy. Trump previously had been more than willing to outline his views on Gaza's future - even when it caught Netanyahu and the Israelis by surprise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Americans also expressed their unhappiness with Israeli attacks on Syria last month - publicly disapproving, while offering even sharper criticism in private.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bibi acted like a madman,\" a White House official told the news website Axios. \"He bombs everything all the time.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As recently as a month ago, the White House was optimistic that a deal was within reach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire,\" Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a \"lasting peace in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But just over two weeks later, ceasefire talks had collapsed, and Witkoff was publicly accusing Hamas of being selfish and not acting in good faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hamas didn't really want to make a deal,\" Trump said on 25 July. \"I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, that will become apparent soon enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Trump administration has got a lot of leverage, \" said Prof Saikal of the Australian National University. \"I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on,\" Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. These moves were designed to bring additional pressure on Israel to wind down its military operations and reach a negotiated settlement with Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both represent a tacit acknowledgement that the current situation is untenable, and that a negotiated peace is further away than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, there is no telling how long this trend will last.
