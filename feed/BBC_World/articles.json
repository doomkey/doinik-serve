BBC Persian is banned from reporting inside Iran by the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the largest nationwide anti-government protests took place on Thursday, the twelfth night of demonstrations.

Unmarked cars were also driven into alleys, with occupants shooting at residents who were not involved in the protests, they said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Two or three people were killed in every alley,\" one witness alleged.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those who have given accounts to BBC Persian say the reality inside Iran is hard for the outside world to imagine, and the death toll reported by international media so far only represents a fraction of their own estimates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International news outlets are not allowed to work freely inside Iran and they are mostly relying on Iranian human rights groups who are active outside the country. On Monday the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 648 protesters in Iran had been killed, including nine people under the age of 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some local sources and eyewitnesses report very high numbers of people killed across different cities, ranging from several hundreds to thousands. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC is currently unable to independently verify these figures and, so far, Iranian authorities have not provided official or transparent statistics on the number of deaths of protesters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Iranian media has reported that 100 security personnel had been killed during the protests, saying that protesters - whom they refer to as \"rioters\" - set fire to dozens of mosques and banks in various cities. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba91/live/c275c1f0-efe2-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Eyewitness image A large group of people gather in front of buildings in Babol.

The Justice Department has been contacted for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ probe was first disclosed by Powell in an unscheduled video statement on Sunday.  He said the Justice Department had threatened a criminal indictment over testimony he gave to a Senate committee last year about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Powell called the investigation \"unprecedented\" and said he believed it stemmed from Trump's anger that the Fed had not brought interest rates down more quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings,\" Powell said. \"Those are pretexts.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The central bank lowered the target for its key lending rate three times in the second half of 2025, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% - its lowest level in three years. But Trump has repeatedly said that the central bank has not cut interest rates as sharply as he would like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ probe \"should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure\", Powell said in his statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's public condemnation of the DoJ move has been signed by former federal government officials appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by Fox News on Monday about the Fed's independence, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt deferred to the Justice Department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jerome Powell has proved he's no good at his job,\" Leavitt said. \"As to whether he's a criminal, that's an answer the Department of Justice is going to have to find.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: The unusual move Powell made in disclosing criminal investigation</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has publicly urged Powell to cut interest rates in order to reduce the US government's hefty borrowing costs and to make it easier for Americans to get mortgages and other loans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, he spent months attacking Powell on social media and in remarks to reporters. He floated the possibility of firing Powell, only to quickly abandon the idea, which analysts say would rock financial markets and spark a legal battle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yellen, who served as Fed chair for a year during Trump's first term before she was replaced by Powell, said in separate comments that the probe was \"extremely chilling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Knowing Powell as well as I do, the odds that he would have lied are zero so I do believe they're going after him because they want his seat and want him gone,\" Yellen told CNBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She suggested investors should be concerned about the development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt… It is the road to banana republic.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is expected to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g907zekllo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">name someone in the coming weeks</a> to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chairman will end in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Justice Department investigation and subsequent backlash could disrupt the confirmation process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial reaction in US stock markets was muted on Monday. The S&amp;P 500 was roughly flat in early afternoon trading - a notable contrast to last year, when markets were jolted by perceived threats to the Fed's independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global markets also proved \"remarkably resilient\" on Monday, said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. She noted that despite the overall calm, financial stocks did slump, as investors weighed the effects of a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlkxjm88ko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">possible 10% cap on credit card interest rates</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, analysts said the market reaction could grow if Trump succeeded in influencing Fed policy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican lawmakers also raised concerns about how the Justice Department probe might affect the Fed's work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative French Hill, the Republican chair of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement that the investigation was causing an \"unnecessary distraction\" and it could \"undermine this and future administrations' ability to make sound monetary policy decisions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee, criticised Powell in a statement but added: \"I do not believe however, he is a criminal. I hope this criminal investigation can be put to rest.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That vote was lacked \"basic transparency and integrity\", according to the UN, and was denounced as rigged by the US which did not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his comments, Juan Pablo Guanipa was tracked down by Venezuelan security forces and detained in May 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After hearing about the planned prisoner release, Ramón Guanipa took the first available flight from Maracaibo, in the west of the country, to Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When they tell you they're going to release your family, everything else becomes small,\" he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when his father was not among those freed, he felt \"defeated\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But at the same time, you find another reason to fight. I'm fighting for them [the interim government] to actually do what they say they're going to do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government has not commented on the pace of the releases, and the attorney general has declined a BBC interview request.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The developments are being viewed as the first test of Trump's influence in Venezuela following the removal of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interim President Delcy Rodríguez has appeared to welcome co-operation with the Trump administration, but her public statements have condemned any form of US intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's announcement about prisoner releases came a day after Trump said that the Venezuelan authorities would shut down El Helicoide, the country's most notorious prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">El Helicoide was originally designed to be a shopping centre and a symbol of Venezuela's oil-fuelled prosperity, but became a fortress of political repression under Maduro.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">El Helicoide prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside El Helicoide in western Caracas, the atmosphere is tense, with relatives keeping vigil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend, while he was in hospital in western Venezuela. Their families have heard nothing since.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farfán does not know where her son is being held but has come to El Helicoide to join others in pleading for their relatives' release - wherever they may be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beside her, Reyes' sister-in-law, cries as she describes how the three were arrested in November 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope they tell us where they are keeping them. We are desperate. We've been waiting for many days without any answers,\" Farfán says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have long accused the government of using detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics, but officials repeatedly denied Venezuela held any political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for criminal activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition activists have described the release of political prisoners as an \"urgent\" step towards any transition of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the small number freed so far has raised doubts about the interim government's intentions and questions over the extent of its willingness to cooperate with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-daniel-wittenberg.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Daniel Wittenberg.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However they continue to argue for other measures, with some experts raising similar concerns.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans,\" Meta said in a blog update.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company said it blocked 330,639 accounts on Instagram, 173,497 on Facebook, and 39,916 on Threads during it's first week of compliance with the new law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They again put the argument that age verification should happen at an app store level - something they suggested lowers the burden of compliance on both regulators and the apps themselves - and that exemptions for parental approval should be created.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy is wildly popular with parents and envied by world leader, with the Tories this week pledging to follow suit if they win power at the next election, due before 2029.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However some experts have raised concerns that Australian kids can circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it robs young people of connection - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Like other chimpanzees at the centre, Ai would scrawl marker pens over blank paper without having to be motivated by food rewards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japanese media outlet Kyodo news reported that she once escaped with another primate - using a key to unlock her cage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2000 she gave birth to a son, Ayumu, who is also known for his remarkable memory.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2017 - the 40th anniversary of the Ai Project - a scarf made from one of Ai's paintings was gifted to renowned primatologist Dame Jane Goodall.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead &amp; Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tributes started to pour in late on Saturday from fellow musicians.

One of these men, who goes by the name Mr Guo, told Chinese media that they intended to raise money by selling 10% of the company for a million yuan. That is a lot more than the 1,000 yuan ($140) they say it cost to build the app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And they're also looking to grow their target audience - saying they are exploring the idea of a new product specifically designed for the elderly in a country where over one-fifth of its population is over the age of 60. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an indication that it was seriously looking at this option, it posted over the weekend, \"we would like to call on more people to pay attention to the elderly who are living at home, to give them more care and understanding.

But his critics say he has maintained his grip on power through a mixture of sidelining opponents and compromising independent institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00nw591\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"We don't believe in [presidential] term limits,\" he once told the BBC</a>, secure in his role after winning a fifth election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, the age limit for a presidential candidate was removed - paving the way, many believe, for Museveni to become president for life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's journey began in 1944, when he was born into a family of cattle keepers in Ankole, western Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He came of age during Uganda's struggle for independence from the UK, which was followed by a period of brutality and turbulence under Milton Obote and Idi Amin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many years, Museveni did not know his birth date, writing in his memoir: \"We had real life-threatening challenges such as extra-judicial killings and looting… we had no time to worry about details such as dates of birth.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 1967, Museveni left Uganda to attend the University of Dar es Salaam in neighbouring Tanzania. There, he studied economics and political science and forged alliances with politically active students from around the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's name gained currency in the 1970s, after a coup by the notorious Amin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni helped form the Front for National Salvation - one of the rebel groups that, with Tanzania's help, ousted Amin. Amin was infamous for crushing dissent and expelling the country's Asian community. Under his eight-year rule an estimated 400,000 people were killed.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0cf6/live/7a1c2310-ebf3-11f0-8608-ef259671aea9.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images An old photo of Nelson Mandela talking to Yoweri Museveni, who wears one of his signature wide-brimmed hats and a suit\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Museveni, wearing his trademark hat, with Nelson Mandela in 1998</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was part of the colonial system,\" <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6IKioxOavQ\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Museveni told the Global Indian Network in a recent interview</a>. \"Idi Amin was ignorant... a bit chauvinistic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following Amin's fall, former President Milton Obote returned to power via a general election. However, Museveni refused to accept Obote's leadership, claiming the vote had been rigged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He launched a guerrilla struggle in 1981 and five years later, his rebel group, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), seized power and Museveni became leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Uganda's economy began to grow steadily and over 10 years, the country saw an average annual growth of more than 6%. Primary school enrolment doubled and HIV levels dropped because of an anti-Aids campaign spearheaded by the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni became a darling of the West, but his reputation took a hit in 1998, when Uganda and Rwanda invaded neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in support of rebels fighting to overthrow the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around this time, critics also complained that the president was growing less tolerant of opposing views. It also became clear he had no plans to cede power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni had said, in a 1986 collection of writing: \"The problem of Africa in general, and Uganda in particular, is not the people but leaders who want to overstay in power.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by 2005 his views had seemingly changed<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>and Uganda's constitution was amended, removing the cap on how many terms a president could serve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2017, the age limit for presidential candidates was also eliminated - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-41398849\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a move which led to MPs throwing chairs in a chaotic parliamentary brawl</a>.</p></div><figure></figure><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni has also faced allegations that he has weakened the independence of key institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In particular, Uganda's judiciary has been accused of recruiting so-called \"cadre judges\" whose loyalty lies with the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When judges have gone against the government, they have sometimes found themselves at loggerheads with the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, in December 2005, armed security personnel raided the High Court in the capital, Kampala, re-arresting members of a suspected rebel group, who had just been acquitted of treason charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The media has also had its independence threatened. On the surface, Uganda has a lively media industry, but numerous outlets have been raided and journalists detained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps the most significant factor in Museveni's longevity is the neutering of potential opposition forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it became clear that Museveni did not intend to leave power, some of his former associates started to break away. As they did, the security agencies turned their attention to them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For instance, Kizza Besigye of the opposition Forum for Democratic Change, who was once Museveni's doctor, first ran against the president in 2001. Since then, he has been arrested and prosecuted numerous times. In 2024, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgeg6rz8xvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he mysteriously disappeared in Nairobi, only to appear four days later in a Ugandan military court</a>.

These have all later been dropped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021 the police tear-gassed and even shot at Bobi Wine and his supporters, saying they had defied coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the current campaign period, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/statements/20260109-press-rel-launch-publ-upt-uga-uganda-office-hc-en.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security forces have used \"firearms and live ammunition to disperse peaceful assemblies\"</a> and abducted opposition party members in unmarked vans, a UN report says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid this environment, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/KagutaMuseveni/status/2001614713315049549\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Museveni ominously told the public that \"one soldier carries 120 bullets\"</a>. However, he also ordered the police not to beat opposition supporters and use tear gas instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's supporters point to the relative stability Uganda has enjoyed in the decades he has been in power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-africa-36284316\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Emmanuel Lumala Dombo, a spokesperson for the NRM, points out that more than 1.7 million people have moved to Uganda</a> after fleeing strife in their own countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Forty years ago, we were among the biggest exporters of refugees among the neighbouring countries that surround us,\" Dombo told the BBC. \"Right now Uganda is the biggest host of refugees in Africa.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This sentiment was echoed by a Museveni supporter who had, surprisingly, turned up to a Bobi Wine rally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ndyasima Patrick told the BBC he would vote for Museveni because \"he has kept us alive for all these years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also respects Museveni's age and feels Bobi Wine would only be ready to lead Uganda when he hits his 50s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's government has recently been encouraging foreign investment, striking deals with the likes of China, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates. He says he wants Uganda to become a middle-income country by 2040.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni sees himself not only as a stable, ambitious presence, but also as a nurturing figure for Uganda's youth. He fondly calls his young followers Bazukulu (meaning grandchildren in the Luganda language) and they refer to him by the nicknames M7 or Sevo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with an eye on Bobi Wine, who is roughly half of Museveni's age, the president has been keen to show his vitality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, to encourage exercise during lockdown he was filmed doing press-ups, and then repeated the trick several times that year, including in front of cheering students.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has addressed his health on numerous occasions, saying late last year: \"I have been here with you for 40 years now. Have you ever heard that I have been in hospital? Except when I had [coronavirus] for 21 days.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Museveni ages, critics worry that he is turning the country into his family's fiefdom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They note that the president's wife, Janet, is the education minister and his son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba is head of the army. Museveni's grandson also enrolled into the army in July, a move seen as potentially perpetuating the family dynasty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NRM has said little about how it will manage Museveni's succession, but speculation that 51-year-old Gen Kainerugaba will step up is rife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Should this come to pass, it could jeopardise Museveni's legacy of stability. Gen Kainerugaba is known for being unpredictable and provocative, especially on social media. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-63136511\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">He has used X to joke about invading Kenya</a>, rile Ethiopia by backing Egypt during a dispute between the two countries and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62x4n90gj0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">admit to detaining Bobi Wine's bodyguard in his basement</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, however, with almost four decades of experience behind him, Museveni is confident he will bag a seventh victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Uganda is secure.

What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?</b></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A protest sign in New Brunswick.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog.

(Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches, hallucinations and seizures. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms that can have a psychological root - sometimes described as being an issue with the brain's 'software' rather than any structural damage. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero, and observed her having a seizure at the clinic. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge is still struggling with her condition, but she has received some treatment for FND and is pursuing more.

She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Global News</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It has been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43940122\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">maligned for gas leaks</a>, and was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46120507\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the reason a plane was grounded</a> after passengers remonstrated against the smell wafting from the cargo hold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans from the region have christened it the \"King of fruits\", but on the internet it has earned a less flattering tag — the world's smelliest fruit — as tourists unused to its odour seek it out with squeamish curiosity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet it has found a growing fanbase in China: as an exotic gift exchanged among the affluent; a status symbol to be unboxed on social media; and the star of culinary heresies from durian chicken hotpot to durian pizza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand and Vietnam are the top durian suppliers to China, accounting for nearly all of its imports. Malaysia's share of the market is sprouting fast, having earned a reputation with premium varieties such as the Musang King.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The average price of durian starts at less than $2 (£1.4) in South East Asia, where they are grown in abundance. But luxe versions like the Musang King could cost anywhere from $14 (£10) to $100 (£74) a pop, depending on their quality and the season's harvest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once I ate Malaysian durian, my first thought was, 'Wow, this is delicious. I have to find a way to bring it to China',\" says Xu Xin, who has been sampling durians at a shop in Raub. The 33-year-old sells the fruit back home in northeastern China, and is on the hunt for the best durians to import.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Koh Ewe Side view of a middle-aged man in a white T-shirt holding a slice of durian in one hand and a yellow glob of durian in the other hand.

Farmers say they have been using the land for decades without any issue, and allege they are now being forced to pay a lease to continue farming there, or face eviction.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/246e/live/82677890-e61b-11f0-bc37-99d14a64a534.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Wide shot of green durian trees and palms planted on hilly terrain\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Durian trees and oil palms dominate Raub's landscape </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a coup may be on the way in China's island province of Hainan, where years of trial and error are bearing fruit.

The natural gas industry is pushing more and more production overseas, contributing to higher domestic prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Electricity generation was \"being saddled with ever-increasing costs of fuel\", said John Quigley, a senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent shifts away from clean energy investments could also be at play. A report from the climate advocacy group Climate Power cites the Trump administration's cancellation of projects that would have produced enough electricity to power the equivalent of 13 million homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gutting of clean energy projects has contributed to a 13% jump in electricity bills since Trump returned to the White House, the report found, as the US increases its dependence on foreign oil.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d75d/live/8c492270-ed5d-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images An aerial view shows cooling vent fans on the roof next to generators on the lower level of a Digital Realty data centre in Ashburn, Virginia\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Energy-hungry data centres have proliferated in places like Virginia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another key factor: energy demand from the artificial intelligence boom is straining the power grid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Technology companies from Alphabet to Amazon are ramping up their investments in AI infrastructure, and data centres require massive amounts of electricity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Continued and increasing electricity demand for data centres is pushing up prices for everyone, Quigley said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'You can deal with people's frustrations'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News in November that electricity prices were a \"state problem\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are things that the federal government can control.
