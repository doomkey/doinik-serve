They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis. The authority – which has been under international pressure to make reforms – says it has recently changed its welfare system</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Alaa Salameh, owner of family-run Afteem restaurant</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The grim economic outlook means that for many Palestinian Christians, even though there are now public events as well as religious services, it will be an austere Christmas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the edge of Manger Square, a few customers are waiting to buy sizzling balls of falafel from a row of shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're preparing for Christmas after one of our hardest periods as Palestinians and as Christians,\" says Alaa Salameh, an owner of Afteem, a decades-old family restaurant which has seen its income plummet. He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Crafted out of titanium sheets, limestone, and glass, the museum was instantly celebrated as a modern marvel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Architect Philip Johnson, Gehry's American contemporary, described the structure as \"the greatest building of our time\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other cities tried to replicate its success, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1HL3drXNNWQVq7tpC6pMRsJ/the-bilbao-effect-how-20-years-of-gehrys-guggenheim-transformed-the-city\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">branded the \"Bilbao effect\"</a>, where investment in daring art could revitalise ailing economies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cultural phenomenon was parodied in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, in which the fictional town of Springfield invites Gehry, who voiced himself in the cartoon TV show, to design a new concert hall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the episode, the shape of the concert hall is jokingly inspired by a letter Gehry had scrunched up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The guest appearance later \"haunted\" Gehry, who told the Observer in 2011 that people sincerely believed his real-life designs were inspired by crumpled paper instead of complex computations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Pushing the envelope'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His work in Bilbao put him in high demand, and he went on to design iconic structures in cities all over the world: the Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago's Millennium Park, the Gehry Tower in Germany, and the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He bestowed upon Paris and upon France his greatest masterpiece,\" said Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH, the worlds largest luxury goods company which owns Louis Vuitton.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a largely unpredictable style, no two of his works look the same. Prague's Dancing House, finished in 1996, looks like a glass building folding in on itself; his Hotel Marques in Spain, built in 2006, features thin sheets of wavy, multicoloured metal; his design for a business school in Sydney looks like a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-31087980\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">brown paper bag</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gehry also designed the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, layered in metal resembling sails billowing in the wind. After it opened in 2003, critics described it as a \"pile of broken crockery\", a \"fortune cookie gone berserk\" and an \"emptied waste basket\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a 2007 interview with the New Yorker, Gehry shrugged off the concert hall's critics: \"At least they're looking!\" he quipped. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tributes are celebrating his eagerness to discard convention - and forge his own creative legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paul Goldberger, author of Building Art: The Life and Work of Frank Gehry, came to know Gehry closely, and said he wanted to work \"until the day he died\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was one of the very few architects of our time to engage people emotionally,\" Goldberger told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was all about pushing the envelope... wanting to use the most advanced technology to do the most adventurous things.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney extended his \"deepest condolences\" to Gehry's family and the \"many admirers of his work\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"His unmistakable vision lives on in iconic buildings around the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum posted a video tribute to Gehry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will be forever grateful,\" the museum wrote on Instagram, \"his spirit and legacy will always remain connected to Bilbao\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Carney has credited it with shielding Canadian businesses from the bulk of US-imposed tariffs on Canada. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those underlying tensions seemed distant on Friday, when the leaders took the stage together to select the balls of their own countries from bowls, marking the beginning of a process to select groups for the initial stage of the jointly-hosted tournament. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaders' body language appeared cordial and warm. Collectively, they posed for a selfie with Fifa President Gianni Infantino on stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reporters later saw Trump sitting with Sheinbaum, who had said earlier in the week that she planned to have a brief one-on-one with Trump to discuss trade matters, including steel, aluminium and automobile tariffs, on the sidelines of the event.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has largely backed away from threats to impose steep tariffs as negotiations continue. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney was sitting beside Sheinbaum. Both have expressed an interest in securing the future of the USMCA, which has been in place in some form since 1994. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate is uncertain pending the outcome of the mandatory review due to be completed in the summer of 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also met for a brief 45 minutes with Sheinbaum and Carney on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Sheinbaum said they talked about the World Cup and separately  \"agreed to continue working together on trade issues with our teams\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney's office said the three agreed to keep working together on the USMCA. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1ead/live/4d713270-d20c-11f0-936b-f537e2f59ee5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Gianni Infantino taking a selfie on stage with Donald Trump, Claudia Sheinbaum and Mark Carney. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The US, Mexico and Canada are jointly hosting next year's Fifa World Cup. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump told reporters in the White House on Wednesday that the US will \"either let it expire, or we'll maybe work out another deal with Mexico and Canada\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that he believed both Canada and Mexico had \"taken advantage\" of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told news outlet Politico on Thursday that Trump is considering dividing the agreement into two parts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our relationship with the Canadian economy is totally different than our relationship with the Mexican economy,\" Greer said, adding: \"It actually doesn't make a ton of economic sense why we would marry those three together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current USMCA deal was signed by Trump during his first term.

It is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to reform the nation's immigration system and combat what they have called \"significant threats to national security and public safety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration has argued the 14th Amendment clause \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" means the amendment excludes children of people who are not in the country permanently or lawfully.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cecillia Wang, national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the plaintiffs in the case, told the BBC's news partner CBS that no president can change the 14th Amendment's fundamental promise of citizenship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For over 150 years, it has been the law and our national tradition that everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth,\"  Ms Wang said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We look forward to putting this issue to rest once and for all in the Supreme Court this term,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is one of about 30 countries - mostly in the Americas - that grant automatic citizenship to anyone born within their borders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After legal challenges were brought to Trump's executive order, several federal  court judges ruled that it violated the Constitution, while two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from going into effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump then went to the Supreme Court to fight the injunctions. In a win for Trump, the court ruled in June that the injunctions issued by the lower courts exceeded their authority, though it did not address the issue of birthright citizenship itself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Solicitor General D John Sauer has argued that the amendment was adopted \"to confer citizenship on the newly freed slaves and their children, not on the children of aliens temporarily visiting the United States or of illegal aliens\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has said it's a \"mistaken view\" that birth on US soil confers citizenship and has argued that that understanding has had \"destructive consequences\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the US in 2016 - a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007, according to The Pew Research Center.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study published in May by the thinktank Migration Policy Institute and Pennsylvania State University's Population Research Institute suggested that repealing birthright citizenship could increase the size of the unauthorized population in the US by an additional 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Netflix is becoming even more powerful</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix has been pulling ahead in Hollywood for years now, ranking as the world's biggest streaming subscription service and largest producer of new content in California. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this deal - the biggest in the industry for years - would confirm its position at the head of the pack, handing the company a catalogue with nearly a century's worth of titles and beefing up its already formidable production capacity.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's not to mention its sheer subscriber might, as Netflix prepares to add some of HBO's 128 million subscribers to its already more than 300 million-strong base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Netflix is already the biggest streaming service and now you add HBO Max to that and it becomes arguably untouchable,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president at research firm Forrester.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61af/live/1b6ba860-d1ed-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Murray Close/Getty Images On the set of the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione looks serious while pointing her wand.

It could mean prices go up.... or down</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix said it hopes to complete the deal in the next year to 18 months.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But executives are coy about how - or whether - they plan to incorporate Warner Brothers and its flagship HBO brand into the existing Netflix service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix's co-chief executive Greg Peters said the HBO name was \"very powerful\" and would give the firm \"a lot of options\", but would not elaborate further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix could package up films and programmes into different bundles, although analysts say they would be surprised to see the HBO brand disappear altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The impact on prices is also unclear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix's dominance could allow it to charge customers more. But if viewers find they are paying for one streaming service rather than two, it could cost them less.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">3. Streaming is the future and Hollywood feels cast aside</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros is one of the studios that defined Hollywood, creating classics such as Casablanca and the The Exorcist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this takeover is an illustration of how cinema's golden age has faded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trajectory is clear, Forrester's Mr Proulx said, the future is \"all-streaming\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With this deal it is official: legacy media is ending.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix has promised to keep releasing films in cinemas, a decision that makes some sense as it will be acquiring the DC superhero franchise, films that do very well in movie theatres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But not everyone believes that will remain a priority for the streamer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, earlier this year Netflix's co-chief executive officer Ted Sarandos said he believed movie-going was an \"outdated concept\".

But if regulators adopt a broader definition, one that includes cable and broadcast TV and even YouTube as Netflix's competitors \"the concentration concerns become less and less\", he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School, said usually a merger like this would be a \"clear-cut case for a challenge\", typically pushing for better terms for consumers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time, she is worried the Trump administration might put pressure on Netflix over questions like diversity and political bias, as has happened in other cases.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">5.

And Trump has always shown a keen interest in the media and entertainment industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been no comment from competition regulators in the US, but a senior Trump administration official told CNBC that it views Netflix's bid for Warner Bros with \"heavy scepticism\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

If they find other countries' practices are superior, then Trump directs them to change the US schedule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He noted in the memo that some other countries recommend fewer immunisations for children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also praised the advisory committee for their Friday decision, calling it \"very good\" in a social media post. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Acip is responsible for making recommendations to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on when and who should be vaccinated. The acting director of the CDC has the final sign-off on the recommendation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new guidance also suggests that babies who do not receive a birth dose of the vaccine should get their initial dose of the shot \"no earlier than two months of age\", a recommendation that several members of the group opposed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public health experts worry the vote could raise unfounded safety concerns about the vaccine and encourage some people to opt out, leading to more sickness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The concern was shared by some members of the Acip panel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hepatitis B vaccine recommendation is very well established,\" Dr Cody Meissner said before voting no. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know it's safe and we know it's very effective. And to make the changes that are being proposed, we will see more children and adolescents and adults infected with hepatitis B.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The panel continues to recommend that babies born to mothers who have tested positive for hepatitis B be given a birth dose of the vaccine. The move is not expected to affect insurance coverage of the shot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hepatitis B is a liver infection that spreads through direct contact with bodily fluids, and can lead to dangerous liver conditions including cancer, liver failure and cirrhosis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pregnant people who have hepatitis B also can transmit the virus to newborns during delivery, which can lead to chronic infections that can damage the liver.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People infected with HBV do not always have symptoms, meaning they may not even be aware they are carrying the virus and can spread it while caring for children and infants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's decision came after a tense two-day meeting on the issue, after the Acip decided to postpone a vote on the hepatitis B shots two times.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, several members of the panel voiced their objections to the new guidelines, and in particular, that shots be recommended no sooner than two months of age. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The voting choices are \"incredibly problematic\", Dr Joseph Hibbeln said, while Dr Meissner said members were acting on \"baseless sceptisicm\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One committee member in favour of the change, Retsef Levi, said the US hepatitis B vaccine policy was \"misaligned\" with other countries around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World Health Organization recommends vaccinating children against HBV at zero, one and six-months old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, vaccines are recommended at eight weeks, 12 weeks and 16 weeks old, unless a mother has tested positive for the virus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During hours of meetings on Thursday and Friday, the committee heard from several physicians, including many who criticised the panel for considering ending universal vaccination recommendations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Committee members who voted in favour of the new recommendations argued that the risk of catching the virus was low and that vaccines should be tailored to individual patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics of the birth dose have argued that babies should only be vaccinated as newborns if their mother tests positive for the virus. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But doctors say this leaves some babies at risk, because not all pregnant people have reliable access to testing, while others could receive a false negative test for hepatitis B.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kennedy and his allies have questioned the safety of the hepatitis B vaccine and have argued it is primarily spread through sexual contact and sharing needles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Research has shown, however, that it can also spread through indirect contact such as shared toothbrushes and razors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office, Kennedy has made a number of changes to US vaccine policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Acip's decision to revisit the vaccine recommendations sparked anger from Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who cast a deciding vote in confirming Kennedy as health secretary despite worries about his previous stances on vaccines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,\" Cassidy said in a statement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the committee's vote, Maryland's state health department issued an issued an advisory on Friday, citing a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, urging health care providers and hospitals to continue to offer the hep B vaccines at birth and said it was working to secure access to the vaccine for all infants and children in the state.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A bipartisan push to release all the records has dogged the president during his second term in office. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The newly enacted law compels the justice department, FBI and federal prosecutors by 19 December to disclose the tranche of materials amassed during investigations into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, was moved from a Florida prison to a new minimum-security facility in Texas in August. On Wednesday, Maxwell's attorney filed a letter in Manhattan federal court asking to be released early. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the transparency law gives the justice department 30 days to release the files, the law also allows it to withhold material related to an active criminal investigation that could identify victims of Epstein's abuse, invade their privacy, or contain images of physical and child sex abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Material that could jeopardise an active federal investigation, is classified or that pertains to national defence or foreign policy is typically not made public, under justice department policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released images of Epstein's infamous island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The photos showed several bedrooms in the US Virgin Islands home, as well as a room with masks on a wall and a phone with the names Darren, Rich, Mike, Patrick, and Larry written on speed-dial buttons.</p></div></div></body></html>"

something Twitch <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/Twitch/status/1979464697364779065\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">refuted in a statement</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Harassment - or the threat of it - is an issue which Blaire says she has also had to face since her rise in popularity online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I could open my Instagram DMs right now and read you 100 horrible things about why or how I could be harmed by people,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021, Blaire said she spent over $2,000 (£1,500) every month to have heavily edited photos of her removed from the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then in January 2023, she discovered a deepfake website was using a likeness of her in pornographic material, alongside other popular female streamers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, she said despite opening a craft shop in Los Angeles earlier this year, it's rare she ever visits -

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans.

At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"International Rescue Committee 3 women sitting in a room, smiling.

Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first.

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.

Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Try to remain civil'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He is now on bail, according to local media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police told the BBC that it \"would handle any action taken in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was also a strong public reaction to the arrest. To some, the decision to arrest him was \"baffling\". To others, it was simply Beijing's playbook, replicated. The Hong Kong government says that it's about trying to protect rule of law in a testing moment for the city. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'A human response to tragedy'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's Executive Council, disputed the suggestion that Hong Kongers are being suppressed. \"The government is trying to be prudent,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regina Ip, another Hong Kong lawmaker, also defended the arrests.

Spain was one of the \"big five\" countries who automatically qualify for the final, due to the size of their financial contribution to the staging of the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years that figure has been between €334,000 to €348,000, according to figures published by Spain's broadcaster, RTVE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other countries will now have to pick up that bill – although the costs will presumably be shared between all competitors, with France, Germany, Italy and the UK taking the lion's share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And if other countries pull out, the cost for every competing nation will presumably rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To lose some of your biggest financial contributors does have a huge impact, and it also has a ripple-down effect for some of the smaller countries,\" according to Jess Carniel of the University of Southern Queensland, a Eurovision scholar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So it does probably mean that we might have a smaller show [in 2026], unless the Austrian broadcaster can get together a bit more cash to make sure that it's still a spectacle.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Severely wounded</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That all means the competition is severely wounded, but the injuries aren't fatal... yet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday was \"a very seismic day in Eurovision\" history, according to Callum Rowe from The Euro Trip podcast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans are \"equally up in arms and devastated at what happened\", he told BBC Radio 5 Live.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're losing countries that have got an illustrious and storied history in the competition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The four boycotting countries won't change their minds before next May's contest in Vienna, Mr Rowe said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whether they'll have a change of heart for 2027 is another question. If they see that Israel don't perform very well in Eurovision in 2026 they might think, oh, well, the rule changes have done what they were meant to do. But I think it's difficult to say at this point.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eurovision director Martin Green estimates that 35 nations will still take part next year in Vienna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The loss of four competitors is balanced by the return of three others – Moldova, Romania and Bulgaria – who have skipped the last couple of years.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Not 'united by music'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The row will cast a long shadow of the contest next year, and probably in future years too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With much of the music industry throwing its weight behind Palestinian causes, it may prove harder than normal to find artists willing to share the stage with Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contest hasn't lived up to its slogan - \"United by music\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mr Weissmann insisted he didn't think the boycott would be damaging for Eurovision as it approaches its 70th anniversary in 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was built 10 years after World War Two - united by music - and that's what is all about.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a difficult situation all over the world with crisis [and] wars, and now it's our duty to keep in contact, to listen to each other, to argue - but then find democratic ways to deal with it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Right now, however, it's difficult to see how the ties that were cut on Thursday can be stitched back together.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

India is the world's fastest growing major economy.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That makes it a hugely attractive market for Russian goods and resources - especially oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is the world's third largest consumer of crude oil and has been buying large volumes from Russia. That wasn't always the case. Before the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, only 2.5% of India's oil imports were Russian.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That figure jumped to 35% as India took advantage of Russian price discounts prompted by sanctions against Moscow and Russia's restricted access to the European market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India was happy. Washington less so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, the Trump administration slapped <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dxr1g4y7yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an additional 25% tariff</a> on Indian goods, arguing that by purchasing oil from Russia, India was helping to fund the Kremlin's war chest. Orders from India for Russian oil have since dropped. President Putin will be keen for India to keep buying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Moscow, weapons sales to India are another priority and have been since Soviet times. Ahead of Putin's visit, there were reports that India plans to purchase state-of-the-art Russian fighter jets and air defence systems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, hit by a labour shortage, also sees India as a valuable source of skilled workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's geopolitics at play, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin enjoys demonstrating that Western efforts to isolate it over the war in Ukraine have failed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying to India and meeting Prime Minister Modi is one way of doing that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is travelling to China and holding talks with Xi Jinping, as Putin did three months ago. He met Modi on the same trip. The image of the three leaders <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cn0r02zgjj4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">smiling and chatting together</a> sent a clear message that, despite the war in Ukraine, Moscow has powerful allies who support the concept of a \"multi-polar world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia lauds its \"no limits partnership\" with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is just as vocal about its \"special and privileged strategic partnership\" with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is a stark contrast to Moscow's strained relationship with the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the Kremlin is sure that the West, including Europe, totally failed,\" believes Novaya Gazeta columnist Andrei Kolesnikov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not isolated, because we have connections to Asia and the Global South. Economically, this is the future. In that sense Russia returned as the main actor in these parts of the globe, like the Soviet Union. But even the Soviet Union had special channels and connections to the US, West Germany and France. It had a multi-vector policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But now we are totally isolated from Europe. This is unprecedented. Our philosophers always said that Russia was a part of Europe.

India-US ties have hit <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15lqe7v302o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">an all-time low</a> in recent months as the two countries have failed to resolve the tariff deadlock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Putin's visit assumes more significance for Modi than ever before because it will test India's geopolitical autonomy. He will be walking the proverbial diplomatic tightrope here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would want to show Indians at home and in the wider world that he still counts Putin as his ally and hasn't given into pressure from Trump, whom he has earlier called his \"true friend\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has also faced pressure from his allies in Europe - just this week, the German, French and UK ambassadors in India wrote a rare <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-plus/international/world-wants-the-ukraine-war-to-end-but-russia-doesnt-seem-serious-about-peace/articleshow/125675348.cms\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">joint article</a> in a major newspaper criticising Russia's stance on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, Modi will have to ensure that the strengthening of India-Russia ties does not overshadow ongoing trade talks with the US and his partnership with Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For India, the challenge is strategic balance - protecting autonomy while navigating pressure from Washington and dependence on Moscow,\" said the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4303/live/3e27e920-d041-11f0-a224-bf3cbaf1e70d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks during a meeting with New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani in the Oval Office of the White House on November 21, 2025 in Washington, DC\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump has imposed an additional 25% tariff on India as penalty for buying Russian oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi's other priority will be to unlock the potential of bilateral trade between India and Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts have often said that the economic relationship between the two strong allies has underperformed for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their bilateral trade rose to $68.72bn at the end of March 2025, up from just $8.1bn in 2020. This was largely due to India sharply increasing discounted Russian oil purchases. This has skewed the balance heavily in favour of Russia and that is something Modi would want to correct.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Indian firms already reducing oil purchases from Russia to avoid sanctions from Washington, the two countries will look at other areas to boost trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence is the easiest pick. India's defence imports from Russia reduced to 36% between 2020 and 2024, from the peaks of 72% in 2010-2015 and 55% between 2015 and 2019, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was largely due to India's attempt to diversify its defence portfolio and boost domestic manufacturing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a closer look at these numbers tells a different story. Several Indian defence platforms still rely heavily on Russia. Many of its 29 air force squadrons use Russian Sukhoi-30 jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's limited armed conflict with Pakistan in May this year proved the indispensable role of Russian platforms like the S-400 air defence systems in its armed forces but it also showed the vulnerabilities that the country urgently needs to fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggest that India wants to buy the upgraded S-500 systems and the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. Pakistan's purchase of the China-made J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter has not gone unnoticed in Delhi, and it would want to secure a comparable jet as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia is already facing a shortage of critical components due to sanctions and the war in Ukraine. The deadline to deliver some units of the S-400 have reportedly been delayed to 2026. Modi will seek some guarantees on timelines with Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi would also want Russia's economy to open space for Indian products to fix the massive trade imbalance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consumer-oriented and high-visibility categories remain marginal: smartphones ($75.9m), shrimp ($75.7m), meat ($63m) and garments at just $20.94m underscore India's limited penetration in Russia's retail markets and electronics value chains despite geopolitical churn,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Modi aims to position Indian goods in Russia's market, especially once the war ends and Moscow is reintegrated into the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would seek to lessen trade dependence on oil and defence, aiming for a deal that strengthens ties with Russia while leaving room to deepen relations with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin's visit is not a nostalgic return to Cold War diplomacy. It is a negotiation over risk, supply chains and economic insulation. A modest outcome will secure oil and defence; an ambitious one will reshape regional economics,\" GTRI said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

\"Just because you have an accent does not make you less American.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump made disparaging comments criticising the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday. \"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you… their country is no good for a reason,\"he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awed said the comments were

At least, not right now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And certainly not the deal (or deals) on the table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No compromise version has yet been found,\" commented Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov after five hours of talks in Moscow involving Putin, US envoy Steve Witkoff, and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No compromise is no real surprise, considering the Kremlin leader's uncompromising comments in recent days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In various statements he has condemned the Ukrainian leadership as a \"thieving junta\", accused European leaders of trying to sabotage peace efforts, and insisted that Russia holds the initiative on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a couple of recent occasions Russian TV showed Putin in military fatigues, studying maps of the front line and trumpeting military gains, many of which Ukraine and international observers have denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After nearly four years of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, despite the heavy losses Russia has suffered on the battlefield and the damage to the Russian economy, President Putin seems convinced that he is winning this war and that now is not the moment to stop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least, that is what he would like the West to believe: that nothing can stop him now from achieving his goals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I've said before that, in many ways, Vladimir Putin reminds me of a car with no brakes, no steering wheel and no reverse gear; a vehicle careering full speed down the motorway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly four years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine there is still no sign of the \"Putinmobile\" turning off, turning back, or coming to a halt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He certainly wants his opponents to think that nothing or no one can force him to change direction: neither European leaders, nor the Trump administration, nor President Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But cars need fuel (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, to fight a war, countries need money (a constant supply).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, despite international sanctions, Russia's government is still able to finance the \"special military operation\" - its war on Ukraine. But economic pressures are building: revenues from oil and gas have been falling, the budget deficit growing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Putin admits there are problems, referring to \"imbalances\" in the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In several sectors, production output not only failed to increase this year but actually decreased,\" Putin said this week. \"Are we satisfied with such trends? No.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big unknown: at what point, if at all, will economic concerns start to influence the Kremlin's calculations on the battlefield?</p></div></div></body></html>"
