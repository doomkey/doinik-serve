This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, tensions continued to build.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.</p></div></div></body></html>"

More than 450 drones and 30 missiles were used in overnight strikes, he added, leaving two people injured and thousands without electricity across seven regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's defence ministry said it used weapons including Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes - which are hard to track as they can change direction mid-flight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant temporarily lost all offsite power overnight \"due to widespread military activities affecting the electrical grid\", but is now reconnected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plant is in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. It isn't operating, but relies on a constant power supply to cool its reactors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Russia, regional governor Roman Busargin said two people were killed in Saratov after a drone strike hit a residential building.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains one of the most intractable topics in the negotiations, with Kyiv refusing to cede land which has been illegally occupied, and Moscow repeating its intention to take the Donbas region in full by force unless Ukraine withdraws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgjnd9y52pno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reacted sceptically to the White House's latest proposal</a> on resolving the territorial question, which is for Ukraine's army to pull out of the region and for it to be turned into a \"special economic zone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president told reporters that under the US-proposed terms, the Kremlin would undertake not to advance into the areas vacated by Ukraine's forces, with the land between Russian-controlled parts of the Donbas and Ukraine's defensive lines effectively turned into a demilitarised zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The proposal, seemingly an attempt to resolve the question of legal ownership by creating a new status for the land, has been publicly questioned by Zelensky, who said: \"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine and allies in Europe have said publicly that the US-led talks have been fruitful, and have hailed progress on securing amendments to a plan which was widely viewed as favouring Russia when it first emerged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there have been signs in recent weeks that Trump is losing patience with Zelensky and his backers on the continent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkr83p73o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">scathing interview with Politico earlier this week</a>, the US president labelled European leaders \"weak\" and renewed his calls for Ukraine to hold elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said elections could be held within 90 days if the US and Europe provided the necessary security. Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, European Union governments <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkr83p73o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets</a> held in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hoped that agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials were still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government being particularly sceptical due to its particular legal exposure as the main holder. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official. It was unclear whether Washington had approved that element of the draft.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

As a result, about $110m worth of medicines were destroyed - estimated at up to 30% of Ukraine's monthly supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a missile and drone strike against our facility. The missiles flew past, but the drones hit it,\" said Dmytro Babenko, acting director-general of pharmaceutical distributor BADM.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They caused a fire which unfortunately proved impossible to contain and the whole facility was destroyed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BADM is one of two companies that supply about 85% of Ukrainian pharmacies in roughly equal shares.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other company is Optima Pharm, whose warehouses have been hit three times this year - on 28 August, 25 October and 15 November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The October attack destroyed its main storage facility in Kyiv, and cost the company more than $100m, says Optima Pharm's chief financial officer Artem Suprun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia denies hitting civilian targets, but when the Optima Pharm warehouse was hit in October, the defence ministry in Moscow said only that it had targeted a factory producing drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the day BADM's warehouse was destroyed, Russia said it had hit \"a warehouse storing military equipment\" as well as energy and transport infrastructure.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks significantly complicate the treatment of sick and wounded in Ukraine,   after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an NGO that had been using the warehouse in Dnipro, says it lost $195,000 worth of medication and supplies, which could have served 30,000 people in need.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I arrived at the site I was devastated, the scene was simply awful. All of this medicine could have served people for years, and in a single moment it was all lost,\" says the IRC's Andriy Moskalenko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IRC said the Dnipro facility had served \"as a critical hub for hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies and humanitarian actors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Babenko from BADM said the Russian attack had destroyed \"vitally important medicines\" that had been imported and are not produced in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a pretty complicated situation,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he is hopeful that the attack will not leave Ukrainians without medicines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There won't be significant shortages, possibly only of certain types of goods. We're hoping to restore all supplies in a month or a month-and-a-half,\" Mr Babenko said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian authorities accuse Russia of deliberately targeting hospitals, ambulances, medics and rescue workers, claims Moscow has denied. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the government in Kyiv, more than 2,500 medical institutions have been damaged or destroyed, and more than 500 civilian doctors, nurses and other medical workers killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said it had recorded 2,763 attacks on Ukraine's healthcare system since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it said that in 2025 there had been a 12% increase in attacks from the previous year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

UN experts have previously accused it of having \"de facto control\" of the rebel force's operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda denies the allegations, however, its presence in Washington was a tacit acknowledgment of its influence over the M23.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rebels were not signatories to Trump's deal - and have been taking part in a parallel peace process led by Qatar, a US ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest fighting risks further escalating an already deeply complex conflict.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why did the M23 seize Uvira now?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist who specialises in the region, told the BBC that the view in M23 circles was that \"they need more leverage in the negotiations\", while the feeling in the Rwandan government is that<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i>Tshisekedi cannot be trusted<i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the assault on Uvira, in South Kivu province, \"flies in the face of all the negotiations that are under way\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It appears to humiliate the US government. I'm not sure what strategic purpose that would serve,\" Prof Stearns told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23's new offensive in South Kivu started a few days before Kagame and Tshisekedi flew to Washington last week to ratify the agreement first hammered out in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bram Verelst, a Burundi-based researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank, said the assault appeared to be an attempt to force Burundi to withdraw the troops it had in eastern DR Congo backing the army against the rebel forces and Rwanda.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Uvira - which lies just 27km (17 miles) from Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika - was of strategic importance because of the presence of at least 10,000 Burundian troops in South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Uvira is Burundi's gateway into eastern DR Congo, to send troops and supplies. That has now been cut off,\" Mr Verelst told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It seems that many Burundian troops are withdrawing, but it's not clear if all contingents will retreat,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yale Ford, an Africa Analyst for the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that Uvira, which had a population of about 700,000, was the DR Congo government's last major foothold and military hub in South Kivu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/what-m23s-capture-of-uvira-means-for-the-drc-wider-region-and-peace-talks-africa-file-special-edition\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the M23 was now likely to establish a parallel administration in the city</a>, and use its military gains \"as a bargaining chip in peace talks\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the DR Congo government, it has not acknowledged its latest military setback, but says that the \"gravity of the situation is compounded by the now proven risk of regional conflagration\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What does it mean for Burundi?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo for years because of its enmity with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both accuse the other of backing rebel groups seeking to overthrow their respective governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbours share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu, it would strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an apparent attempt to placate Burundi's fears, the M23 said it had \"no sights beyond our national borders\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our fight has the objective of peace, the protection of the population, the rebuilding of the state in DR Congo, as well as the stability of the Great Lakes region,\" the group added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has shut its border with DR Congo, but, according to Mr Verelst, it is still allowing people to cross into its territory after carrying out security checks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid agencies say that about 50,000 people have fled into Burundi in the past week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundian troops - along with the Congolese army and allied militias - fought to block the rebel advance towards Uvira, but the city itself fell \"without much fighting\", Mr Verelst said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Uvira would hit Burundi's already struggling economy as the country has been suffering from a severe shortage of foreign currency and fuel, and had been heavily dependent on eastern DR Congo for both, he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How did the M23 manage to capture Uvira?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 began a major advance earlier this year when it captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on the border with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, South African troops were deployed to help DR Congo's army, but they were forced to withdraw after the M23 seized the city in January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly afterwards the rebels captured the next big city in eastern DR Congo, Bukavu, capital of South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move on Uvira came after the rebels broke the defence lines of the DR Congo army, militias allied with it and Burundian troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the M23 was estimated to have more than 10,000 fighters, but there was likely to have been an \"influx\" of Rwandan troops for the recent offensive to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The reason why they are able to defeat their enemy is that the Rwandan army, at least, is very disciplined, and I think discipline matters more than manpower,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The conflict in recent days has also featured the extensive use of drone technology on both sides but the Rwandans have used this more to their advantage than the Congolese,\" he added.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Where does this leave the peace process?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears to be in deep trouble.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US ambassador to the UN blamed Rwanda for the recent fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Instead of progress toward peace, as we have seen under President Trump's leadership in recent weeks, Rwanda is leading the region toward more instability and toward war,\" Mike Waltz told a Security Council meeting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier statement - issued by the US, European Union, and eight European governments - went further, saying that both the M23 and the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) should immediately halt \"offensive operations\", and Rwandan troops should withdraw from eastern DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the policy experts he had spoken to were \"baffled\" by the timing of the move to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was literally as they were signing a peace deal in Washington that Rwandan troops were amassing, and then invaded the area around Kamanyola, which is across the border from Rwanda, and then advanced on Uvira,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Leaders of Rwanda and DR of Congo sign peace deal alongside Donald Trump</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda's foreign ministry has not responded to the claims that its troops were in South Kivu, but said the ceasefire violations and fighting could not be \"attributed\" to Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It accused the DR Congo and Burundian armies of bombing villages near the Rwandan border, and said Burundi had \"amassed\" nearly 20,000 troops in South Kivu in support of DR Congo's army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it was now clear that DR Congo was \"never ready to commit to peace\", and even though Tshisekedi had attended the ceremony in Washington, it was \"as if he had been forced to sign\" the peace accord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DR Congo's government levelled a similar accusation against Kagame, saying he had made a \"deliberate choice\"  to abandon the Washington Accord, and to undermine Trump's efforts to end the conflict.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Can the deal be salvaged?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the US-led peace process was now on a \"troubled path, perhaps it is stuck\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that the success of the deal hinged on DR Congo's army launching an operation to disarm the FDLR militia group, members of which were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and which Kagame's government sees as a continued threat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, Prof Stearns said, he could not see DR Congo's army launching such an operation at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The peace deal also envisaged economic co-operation between DR Congo and Rwanda, including on hydro-electric power, mining and infrastructure development - something that the US hopes would pave the way for American companies to increase investments in the mineral-rich region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said he could not see this happening either while Rwandan troops remained in eastern DR Congo, and fighting continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that his understanding was that the parallel peace process in Doha - led by Qatar's government to broker a peace deal between the M23 and DR Congo's government - was also on hold at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's very difficult to imagine the Congolese returning there right now after there has been this major offensive by the M23,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Tshisekedi's options?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said that Tshisekedi was under \"very serious\" pressure from the public for his failure to keep his numerous promises to bring an end to the fighting in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Tshisekedi might also be under pressure from parts of the army, with whom he had a strained relationship after the arrest of generals for alleged corruption and because of the setbacks in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Tshisekedi was banking on the US to put pressure on Rwanda to withdraw its support for the M23.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be very difficult for the Congolese army to muster a response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's now in the hands of the various peace brokers, the US in particular, and perhaps Qatar and other donors,\" the academic said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's to be seen how much they care about ending this conflict, and how much political capital they are willing to spend.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about the DR Congo conflict:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Germany later expelled two Russian diplomats, as prosecutors suspected that he was acting on the orders of Russia's state security agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it is yet to respond to the latest allegations, Moscow has previously denied  European allegations of a Russian sabotage or hybrid campaign.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Iran does not appear to have commented.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mohammadi was awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism against female oppression in Iran and promoting human rights. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December 2024, she <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c75w695k932o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was given a temporary release from jail</a> for three weeks on medical grounds, after being held in Tehran's notorious Evin prison since 2021. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was expected to return to prison soon after, where she was serving multiple sentences. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her latest arrest reportedly came as she attended a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a lawyer found dead in his office last week. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Norway-based group Iran Human Rights had called for an independent inquiry to establish how he died, saying the circumstances around his death were \"suspicious\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several other activists were detained at the ceremony, where it's reported they shouted slogans, including \"death to the dictator\" and \"long live Iran\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taghi Rahmani, Ms Mohammadi's husband, told BBC Persian: \"They arrested Narges violently.

The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/articles/c5y9y2r5l77o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most vets disagree. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An audience member even compares the atmosphere to \"Woodstock without the drugs\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans aren't just obsessed with the music. They hear themselves in her lyrics and see themselves in her public persona, as she navigates love, heartbreak, illness, treachery and finding your place in the world. She's a best friend, or an older sister, or a combination of the two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So when Swift takes a phone call in the documentary and says, \"Baby\", the whole theatre erupts -

laughing boisterously at on-screen jokes, marking the choreography through aggressive chair dancing, and cheering for each other as they rotated into scenes and through plot lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swift is both comfortable and content to let this diverse cast  \"pull focus\" and steal scenes, both on and off the stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During one particularly moving segment, dancer Kameron Saunders - one of the tour's breakout stars - talks about his struggle to get hired because of his size and look.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, when his mum attends the tour, he tells her how much her love and support meant as he waited for his opportunity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As those scenes played in New York, Swift affectionately turned to Saunders and yelled, \"YES!\" as he giggled and covered his face in feigned shyness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's easy to feel how life-changing the tour was for everyone involved.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">5) We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Taylor Swift with her crew at the premiere of the Eras tour movie in 2023\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Emotions ran high throughout the world tour</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As any Swiftie who has endlessly shout-sung the bridge to their favourite break-up song can tell you, there is no shortage of weeping in the Taylor-verse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Truly, there is So. Much. Crying. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The docuseries is no exception.

The simplest answer is that they're a rite of passage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putting the show together, Swift says she was \"thinking of all the girls I was before this one,\" while re-recording her albums and \"surgically tweaking\" songs to make them fit the show.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would seem the tears are a manifestation of feeling fully seen through her lyrics - of not feeling like you're being \"too much,\" or \"too dramatic,\" or \"too sensitive,\" as Swift broadly puts it - and having the freedom to express femininity without shame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As you watch, it becomes clear that these record-breaking shows were intended as a place safe to explore a wide spectrum of emotions and, in that, they truly succeeded.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

(2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar.

He believed that human societies were moving towards more rational forms regulated by effective and binding legal frameworks because only such frameworks enabled people to live in harmony, to prosper and to co-operate. However, his belief in inevitable progress was not based on an optimistic or high-minded view of human nature. On the contrary, it comes close to Hobbes's outlook: man's violent and conflict-prone nature makes it necessary to establish and maintain an effective legal framework in order to secure peace. We cannot count on people's benevolence or goodwill, but even 'a nation of devils' can live in harmony in a legal system that binds every citizen equally. Ideally, the law is the embodiment of those political principles that all rational beings would freely choose.

The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office A note from police search of Mr Mangione\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prosecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald's</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A fake name leads to an arrest</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald's</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bullets, a journal and cash: a peak into Mr Mangione's backpack</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office Dozens of $100 bills found during Mr Mangione's arrest\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Evidence found during Mr Mangione's arrest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hearing is expected to continue into next week.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin in a dark suit with a burgundy tie patterned with white dots shakes hands with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who wears a dark suit and an orange tie with white dots\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025.

It's a circuitous route from home in Perth to the Fiona Stanley Hospital - but it's worth it, he says, to sit down for a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons with people he may not know but with whom he shares a great deal in common.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sadmir and his board game companions are just some of the 300 patients at the gaming disorder clinic, Australia's only publicly-run institution of its type, helping patients wean themselves off excessive online gaming habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The room where they meet is a simple space in a faceless hospital but in the corner, there's a pile of boardgames on a chair.

So I think that for me, the damage has already been done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former quantum finance intern interested in AI, Mr Koo lost his job just before the pandemic. Living in Sydney, he had no family nearby and no regular work. He says he lost confidence and ended up consumed by online gaming, likening his experience to substance abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Vecchio agrees with the comparison - if she had her way, she'd be tempted not just to expand the social media ban to gaming but to raise the age to 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaming disorder is also now recognised by the World Health Organisation as an official diagnosis and, according to a 2022 Macquarie University study, around 2.8% of Australian children are affected by it. Vecchio thinks the number at risk is higher.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether he might have benefited from a social media ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government says its ban is about protecting kids from harmful content, cyberbullying, online grooming and \"predatory algorithms\" among other things – some or all of which could arguably be said to exist with gaming platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australia Federal Police are among those who have warned chatrooms on these sites are hotbeds for radicalisation and child exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, as the eSafety Commissioner said last month, the legislation enforcing the ban means platforms were not selected according to \"safety, a harms or risk-based assessment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, platforms have been selected according to three criteria: whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exceptions were made for gaming, for example, because its primary purpose is not social-media style interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law, say some experts, makes no sense.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's incompetence, it's reactionary,\" says Marcus Carter, professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Social interaction is not a bad thing… There are a bunch of probably legitimate concerns about these big tech platforms and what they are affording children and what they are exposing them to so as a result we've said we are banning social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just wish the government was trying to figure out how to help rather than put a band-aid on a bullet wound,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 seconds</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, also says the ban on social media is too blunt a tool – instead a more nuanced approach is needed, including towards gaming platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is such a wide spectrum of gaming from incredibly positive, nurturing, fun, creative, expressive spaces - something like Minecraft comes to mind where it's had so many positive uses.\" However, platforms like Roblox are at the other end of the spectrum, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Roblox isn't a game. It's a series of enabling tools for other people to make games. And we know that some of the games that have been made that clearly feel like they're meant for adults have been accessed by very young people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Professor Leaver's desk at the university are three plushies with inbuilt ChatGPT inside them. On the box, it says they are suitable for three and above. This, he says, has also gone too far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do think there needs to be age-appropriate regulation,\" he says, referring to young people going online. \"I do think we're at a moment, and it's not just Australia, you look across the EU, there is huge appetite for all sorts of regulation.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A treatment plan, not a cure</h2></p><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Mr Koo's case, for example, his vice wasn't just gaming. It was AI chatbots, another feature of online life that has come under scrutiny for everything from making things up to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3xgwyywe4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">allegedly encouraging children to kill themselves</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is evidence they are designed to manipulate users into prolonging interactions and their use has even given rise to a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24zdel5j18o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new phenomenon called AI psychosis</a>, in which people increasingly rely on AI chatbots and then become convinced that something imaginary has become real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Koo also started googling his mental health issues and relying on AI to help confirm his diagnoses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're Googling stuff that you think you already know and then you kind of tick the box after that saying, oh, I've already done my work for today, my therapy work with ChatGPT,\" he says. Mr Koo suffered a psychotic episode and after extensive therapy with a professional, he now takes a different approach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I might Google or ChatGPT something and then I'll check it with my therapist in person,\" he says. \"I do think being able to read human emotions and having that face-to-face conversation with someone is completely different.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has said it will continually review the list of banned platforms and at the end of November added Twitch, a streaming platform where people typically play video games while chatting to viewers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Communications Minister Anika Wells also <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnv2z059745o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the BBC last week</a> that the eSafety Commissioner \"definitely has her eye on Roblox\". And, she said, the social media ban \"isn't a cure, it's a treatment plan\" that will \"always evolve\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demand for platforms to do better is growing. So too are the queues of families waiting to get help at the gaming disorder clinic, but Vecchio has to turn them away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[The legislation] is excluding platforms where children interact with many others and some of them can be people who harm them,\" says Vecchio. \"Children need to be protected, they need to be safeguarded.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's pitch black. We're using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the risks, they didn't. Machado arrived safely in Oslo, Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize just before midnight on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had been living in hiding in her own country since Venezuela's widely disputed elections last year, and hadn't been seen in public since January. Her grown-up children, who she hadn't seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grey Bull specialises in rescue missions and evacuations, especially from conflict and disaster zones. A representative from Machado's team confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the organisation was behind her rescue operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Stern said that Grey Bull had been building up a presence in the Caribbean, including inside Venezuela and the neighbouring island of Aruba, for months to get ready for potential operations in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've been building infrastructure on the ground in Venezuela designed to get Americans, allies and Brits and other people out should the war in Venezuela start,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speculation has been mounting over possible US military action against Venezuela, after US President Donald Trump called on President Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Stern said the challenge in this case was getting somebody out who is as well-known as María Corina Machado - a household name in Venezuela for the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of the infrastructure his firm had built up in the country, he said, was \"designed for the second most popular person in the damn country with a target on her back.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: María Corina Machado on her 'very dangerous' escape from Venezuela</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he was first put in contact with Machado's team, they did not initially disclose her identity, but Mr Stern said he was able to guess. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they got in touch with him in early December, through a contact who knew Machado's team, it was apparently the second attempt to get her out of Venezuela, after an initial plan \"didn't go well,\" Mr Stern said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The operation was dubbed \"Golden Dynamite\" because \"Nobel invented dynamite\" and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize award.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Matters moved quickly. Mr Stern said he spoke with the team on a Friday, they deployed on the Sunday, and by Tuesday, their mission was complete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His team had explored various possibilities to get Machado out of the country, and settled on a plan that involved a tumultuous sea journey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To protect his future work in Venezuela, Mr Stern can only reveal so much about the trip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By land, they moved Machado from a house where she was in hiding, to a pick-up spot for a small boat, which took her off the coast to a slightly bigger boat where she met up with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The voyage was in \"very rough seas\" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in \"pitch-black darkness,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet, we were all soaked, the waves were very rough, and we used that to our advantage.
