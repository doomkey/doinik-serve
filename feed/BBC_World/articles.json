China called the \"collective punishment\" of people in Gaza unacceptable, while Russia warned against a \"reckless intensification of hostilities\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">UN Assistant Secretary General Miroslav Jenca told the meeting: \"If these plans are implemented, they will likely trigger another calamity in Gaza, reverberating across the region and causing further forced displacement, killings, and destruction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ramesh Rajasingham from the UN's humanitarian office said the hunger crisis in Gaza was no longer looming, adding that \"this is starvation, pure and simple\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the United States defended Israel, with Ambassador Dorothy Shea telling the meeting the US had been working \"tirelessly\" to free hostages and end the war, and the meeting undermined those efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She added the war \"could end today if Hamas let the hostages go\", and accused other members of taking advantage of the meeting to \"accuse Israel of genocide\", an allegation she insisted was \"demonstrably false\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later on Sunday, Netanyahu's office said he had spoken with US President Donald Trump about Israel's plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4ged13jjglo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across Israel</a> to oppose the government's plan, fearing it puts the lives of hostages at risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his press conference, Netanyahu said the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had been instructed to dismantle the \"two remaining Hamas strongholds\" in Gaza City and a central area around al-Mawasi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also outlined a three-step plan to increase aid in Gaza, including designating safe corridors for humanitarian aid distribution as well as more air drops by Israeli forces and other partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the plan would also include increasing the number of safe distribution points managed by the controversial US and Israeli-backed Gazan Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN reported earlier this month that 1,373 Palestinians had been killed seeking food since late May, when GHF set up aid distribution sites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu claimed Hamas had \"violently looted the aid trucks\", and, when asked about Palestinians killed at GHF sites, said \"a lot of firing was done by Hamas\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked about the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza - 20 of whom are still thought to be alive - Netanyahu said \"if we don't do anything, we are not going to get them out\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli leader also took aim at the international press, saying it had bought into Hamas propaganda. He labelled some of the photos of malnourished children in Gaza that have run on newspaper front pages across the world as \"fake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout the war, Israel has not allowed international journalists into Gaza to report freely. But Netanyahu said a directive telling the military to bring in foreign journalists had been in place for two days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since Saturday, five people have died as a result of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza, bringing the total number to 217 deaths, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also said that in total more than 61,000 people have been killed as a result of Israel's military campaign since 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel launched its offensive in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October that year, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past, figures from the Hamas-run health ministry were widely used in times of conflict and seen as reliable by the UN and other international organisations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In a place where nation, religion and war are linked inextricably with politics and the possession of land, Simcha chose a patch of shade under a fig tree next to a spring of fresh water. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From his dusty car, a small Toyota fitted with off road tyres, he produced a bottle of juice made from fruit and vegetables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Don't worry, there's no extra sugar,\" he said as he poured it into plastic cups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha is the leader of a group of Jewish settlers steadily transforming a big stretch of the rolling terrain south of Hebron in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He moved two large flat stones into the shade as seats, and we sat down in a patch of lush grass, kept alive in the harsh summer heat by water dripping from a pipe coming out of the spring. It was a small oasis at the foot of a steep, arid, rocky slope and the location, if not our conversation, felt peaceful in a way that the West Bank rarely does these days.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea started well over a century ago when Zionists from Europe began to buy land to set up communities in Palestine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has been shaped by significant turning points. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest has come from the deadly 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas and Israel's devastating response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The consequences of the last 22 months of war, and however more months are left before a ceasefire, threaten to spread across years and generations, just like the Middle East war in 1967, when Israel captured Gaza from Egypt and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The scale of destruction and killing in the Gaza war obscures what is happening in the West Bank, which smoulders with tension and violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since October 2023, Israel's pressure on West Bank Palestinians has increased sharply, justified as legitimate security measures.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The enemy in our land lost hope to stay here, says Meir Simcha</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Evidence based on statements by ministers, influential local leaders like Simcha and accounts by witnesses on the ground reveal that the pressure is part of a wider agenda, to accelerate the spread of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories and to extinguish any lingering hopes of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians and human rights groups also accuse the Israeli security forces of failing in their legal duty as occupiers to protect Palestinians as well as their own citizens - not just turning a blind eye to settler attacks, but even joining in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Violence by ultra-nationalist Jewish settlers in the West Bank has risen sharply since 7 October 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ocha, the UN's humanitarian office, estimates an average of four settler attacks every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The International Court of Justice has issued an advisory opinion that the entire occupation of Palestinian territory captured in 1967 is illegal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's rejects the ICJ's view and claims that the Geneva Conventions forbidding settlement in occupied territories do not apply - a view disputed by many of its own allies as well as international lawyers.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the shade of the fig tree, Simcha denied all suggestions he had attacked Palestinians, as he celebrated the fact that most of the Arab farmers who used to graze their animals on the hills he has seized and tend their olives in the valleys had gone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He looks back to the Hamas October attacks, and Israel's response ever since, as a turning point.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think that a lot has changed, that the enemy in our land lost hope. He's beginning to understand that he's on his way out; that's what has changed in the last year or year and a half.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today you can walk around here in the land in the desert, and nobody will jump on you and try to kill you. There are still attempts to oppose our presence here in this land, but the enemy is starting to understand this slowly. They have no future here. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The reality has changed. I ask you and the people of the world, why are you so interested in those Palestinians so much? Why do you care about them? It's just another small nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Palestinians don't interest me. I care about my people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha says the Palestinians who left villages and farms near the hilltops he has claimed simply realised that God intended the land for Jews, not for them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 24 July this year, a panel of UN experts came to a different conclusion. A statement issued by the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said: \"We are deeply troubled by alleged widespread intimidation, violence, land dispossession, destruction of livelihoods and the resulting forcible displacement of communities, and we fear this is severing Palestinians from their land and undermining their food security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The alleged acts of violence, destruction of property, and denial of access to land and resources appear to constitute a systemic pattern of human rights violations.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha has a plan to dig a swimming pool at the base of the spring where we sat to talk. Like many others who are leading the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, he is full of plans. When I met him first, not long after Hamas burst through Israel's border defences on 7 October 2023, he lived in a small group of isolated caravans on a hilltop overlooking the Judean desert as it sweeps down to the Dead Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, Simcha says his community has expanded into around 200 people on three hilltops. He was part of the faction of the settler movement known as hilltop youth, a radical fringe that became notorious for the violent harassment of Palestinians. Most Israelis who have settled in the occupied territories are not like Simcha. They went there not for ideological and religious reasons, but because property was cheaper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now men like Simcha are at the centre of events, with their leaders in the cabinet, leading the charge, married, older, thinking not just about swimming pools for their children but of victory over the Palestinians, once and for all, and everlasting Jewish possession of the land. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Simcha comes across as a happy man. He believes his mission - to implement the will of God by turning the West Bank into a land for Jews, and not for Palestinians - is progressing nicely.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Israel's decades-old project</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's project to settle Jewish citizens in the newly occupied territories started within days of its victory in 1967. Over the last almost 60 years, successive Israeli governments and some wealthy sympathisers have invested vast amounts of money and energy to get to the point where around 700,000 Israeli Jews live in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">I have been watching the settlements grow for about half of the lifetime of the project, since I first reported from the occupied Palestinian territories in 1991. In that time, the terrain of much of the West Bank has been transformed. The bigger settlements look like small towns, and the West Bank is carved into sections by a network of roads and tunnels built by Israel that are as much about staking an immovable claim to the land as they are about traffic management. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On remote hilltops at night, you can see the lights coming from the caravans of settlers who see themselves as Jewish pioneers. Olive groves, orchards and vineyards owned by Palestinian farmers along the road network are often overgrown, sometimes dotted with piles of rubble left from buildings Israel has demolished. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Controlling the land around the roads is necessary, Israel says, to stop attacks on Jews in the West Bank. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Farmers in areas under settler pressure often need military permission to visit their land, sometimes just once a year.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian farmers going about their business in vans or on donkeys used to be a common sight. In many parts of the West Bank, you just do not see them anymore, especially in places like the settlements east of Shiloh on the road to Nablus, where small groups of shacks and caravans on hilltops have connected up into sprawling residential hubs linked by sinuous road networks.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Motaz Tafsha, mayor of West Bank town Sinjel: \"They want to take our land, and they have the green light\"</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When first I reported on settlements, Israeli leaders would often say that national security depended on them. Enemies lurked across the Jordan valley, and pushing out the frontier, building the land, was a Zionist imperative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like the kibbutz movement of collective farms in the 1920s and 1930s inside present-day Israel, settlements in the occupied territories after 1967 were strategically placed as a first line of defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In this conflict, land is a vital commodity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trading land taken by Israel in 1967 for peace with Palestinians who wanted it for a state was at the heart of the Oslo peace process that ended in violence but provided a false dawn of hope in the 1990s.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were headlines around the world when, after months of secret negotiations in Norway in 1993, there was a handshake on the White House lawn between Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. They had signed a declaration of principles that was hoped would lead to the end of the conflict.  Israel would relinquish occupied land to Palestinians.

He claims he campaigned to serve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two ministers are very different people to the secular politicians - retired generals like Yigal Allon from the Israeli left and Ariel Sharon from the right - two men who drove the settlement movement forward in its first two decades after 1967.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just like Allon and Sharon, they believe that security requires power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But for Smotrich, Ben Gvir and their followers, that is underpinned by the certainty of religious belief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The influence they have acquired in return for supporting Netanyahu and keeping him in power continues to frustrate and enrage secular Israel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Smotrich's Israeli opponents use the word \"messianic\" as term of abuse when they talk about him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Allon and Sharon could be ruthless. After the 1967 war, Allon advocated the annexation of large parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. Neither man believed they were doing the will of God.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas uses religion to justify its violent opposition to the existence of Israel. Religious Zionists in the settler movement believe they are doing God's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Belief in a direct connection with God does not guarantee war.

He is one of Israel's most prominent opponents of the occupation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shaul founded an organisation called Breaking the Silence after, as a soldier, he saw first-hand the inherently brutal realities of a military occupation that has lasted almost 60 years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fellow Israelis have branded supporters of Breaking the Silence, which he no longer leads, as traitors many times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli military crackdowns since the October attacks have reduced Palestinian violence against settlers, while settler attacks on Palestinians have grown sharply.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shaul says that the line between settlers and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has become blurred. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The war in Gaza has required the longest mobilisation of military reservists - the backbone of the IDF - in Israel's history.

People scour the inhospitable landscape stretching across several countries in the hope of finding one to sell on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was \"sold by the local community to an international dealer\" and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The University of Florence's magazine described the person as \"an important Italian gallery owner\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A team of scientists led by Giovanni Pratesi, mineralogy professor at the university, was able to examine it to learn more about its structure and where it came from. The meteorite was then briefly on display last year in Italy, including at the Italian Space Agency in Rome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was next seen in public in New York last month, minus two slices that stayed in Italy for more research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sotheby's said that NWA 16788 was \"exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A spokesperson added that Sotheby's was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and \"we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Sereno, who founded the organisation NigerHeritage a decade ago, is convinced Nigerien law was broken.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the country's vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Niger's cultural and natural heritage – including anything that has fallen from outer space - returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A stunning museum on an island on the River Niger that runs through the capital, Niamey, is being planned to house these artefacts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"International law says you cannot simply take something that is important to the heritage of a country - be it a cultural item, a physical item, a natural item, an extraterrestrial item - out of the country. You know we've moved on from colonial times when all this was okay,\" Prof Sereno says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A series of global agreements, including under the UN's cultural organisation Unesco, have tried to regulate the trade in these objects. But, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/maps.13396\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">according to a 2019 study</a> by international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. It is left to individual states to clarify the position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Niger passed its own law in 1997 aimed at protecting its heritage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Sereno points to one section with a detailed list of all the categories included. \"Mineralogical specimens\" are mentioned among the art works, architecture and archaeological finds but meteorites are not specifically named.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its statement on the Sotheby's sale, Niger admitted that it \"does not yet have specific legislation on meteorites\" - a line that the auction house also pointed out. But it remains unclear how someone was able to get such a heavy, conspicuous artefact out of the country without the authorities apparently noticing.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc7e/live/1e7d38f0-7218-11f0-887a-cdb25e1d5cde.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A meteorite hunter walks across a desert landscape looking down as he searches for rocks.

She admits though that the new rules have not been entirely successful in stemming the flow of the meteorites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2011, Prof Chennaoui was responsible for gathering material in the desert from an observed meteorite fall that turned out to be from Mars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Later named the Tissint meteorite, it weighed 7kg in all, but now she says only 30g remain in Morocco.

The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he had shyly asked to the prom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes.

That is ruled out, absolutely ruled out.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The New York Times reported on Friday that Trump had secretly signed a directive to begin using military force on foreign soil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement to the BBC, the White House did not address the directive but said that Trump's \"top priority is protecting the homeland\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The reported directive appears to follow an executive order signed by Trump earlier this year formally designating eight drug cartels as terrorist entities - six of which are Mexican.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to reporters, Sheinbaum said the Mexican government was informed that an order on the cartels was coming, and \"that it had nothing to do with the participation of any military personnel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is not part of any agreement, far from it.

In the past, Aliyev has demanded that Armenia give his country a railroad corridor to Nakhichevan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Armenia wanted to have control of the road and the Azerbaijani leader has in the past threatened to take the corridor by force. The issue has halted and stalled previous peace negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both leaders praised Trump and his team throughout the meeting: \"President Trump, in six months, did a miracle,\" Aliyev said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump said he had also signed a bilateral agreement with both countries to expand  energy and technology trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US president has sought to make peace deals between several warring countries during his second term.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The summit on Friday also signifies the US expanding its influence in the region at the expense of Russia. For more than a century, the Kremlin has played the role of power and peace broker there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most recently, Russian President Vladimir Putin himself has acted as the main mediator in the conflict. The last agreement signed by Aliyev and Pashinyan was crafted by Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump now bringing the two countries together, Putin is largely sidelined. Moscow has worked to insert its interests into peace talks, but both sides abandoned those proposals in favour of an American solution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The announcement on Friday came shortly before Trump announced that he would meet Putin for talks in Alaska next week.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Symbols like the Celtic harp and the Shamrock are seen by many as belonging to both traditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are unionists who cheer for an Irish rugby team but would never dream of singing the anthem of the Republic - a new song, Ireland's Call, was written for the 1995 World Cup.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a complex and evolving set of choices, with frequent arguments. Promotion of the Irish language is bitterly opposed by a vocal section of Unionism. For most Catholics their Irish identity was historically something to be defended in a Unionist dominated state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was an identity that helped bind them to their co-religionists on the rest of the island, particularly in the fields of Gaelic sport and culture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But as politics has changed there is less preoccupation with religious background, a greater sense of belonging to an international culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And this is without even beginning to speak of an identity that is demonstrably northern Irish with its shared dry humour.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Cultural Irishness: from Sally Rooney to The Beatles</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Everyone has their own menu of what being \"culturally Irish\" means - for me, it's about humour, about a love of words and music, and a refusal to take ourselves, or anybody else, too seriously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It can also mean a sense of a particular landscape, either one you loved, or were glad to escape - or for second or third - generation Irish, a landscape of brief immersion on summer holidays from England. That was the world of \"the streams, the rolling hills/Where his brown eyes were waiting\" evoked by Shane MacGowan of the Pogues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are as many definitions of \"culturally Irish\" as there are Irish people, or people who want to be Irish.

I am Irish. Living in Britain. I was born here while my father was a real-life cultural import, acting in the West End in J.M. Synge's landmark drama, The Playboy of the Western World, a story from the west of Ireland, which won rave reviews from London audiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We went home after the play ended and I was brought up in Ireland. But I returned to work for the BBC. I have spent more than three decades as a correspondent for the BBC, and I have lived outside Ireland for longer than I did in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What does that make me?

But I also cherish how that music is connected to the music of Scotland and North America, and I reckon one of the greatest songs of Irish exile was written by Englishman, Ralph McTell: \"And the only time I feel alright is when I'm into drinking/ It sort of eases the pain of it and levels out my thinking… It's a long way from Clare to here.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My attachment to South Africa has shaped me in enduring and indelible ways too. Identity is also a story of deep and loving relationships, whether in Ireland, London, the African continent or France, to name but three important ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">My feelings about identity are also inextricably linked to my experiences as a war reporter. I spent too many years witnessing ethnic cleansing, genocide and crimes against humanity often carried out because of hatred of a different identity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The great writer, James Joyce, rejected any identity built around \"nationality, language, religion\" and defiantly vowed to \"fly by those nets\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He was writing about a different, much narrower Ireland of the early 20th century. But the policing of identity – who you are allowed to be - is disturbingly present in many societies, and many guises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, if somebody asks me to narrow my identity to a single label, I refuse, because it is mine, not to be explained or justified.

We are in a transitional phase,\" acknowledged Nahid Islam, a student leader who helped spearhead the protests and acted as an adviser to the interim government until recently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Islam agrees there are challenges facing the country, but dismisses concerns of growing Islamist influence, saying it was \"part of a broader cultural struggle\" that has existed for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are also signs of progress. Many credit the interim government with stabilising the country's economy and, contrary to fears, the banking sector has survived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bangladesh has met its loan obligations, kept food prices largely stable, and maintained robust foreign exchange reserves - currently at $30bn (£22bn) - thanks to remittances and international loans. Exports have also held steady.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then there are other, less easily measurable things.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Islam argues that, since the fall of Hasina, \"a democratic environment has been established, and now everyone can express their views freely\". That is something to be celebrated in a country shaped by a history of political turbulence, military coups, assassinations, and bitter rivalries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that is being questioned by some.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The influence of student leaders over the interim government has drawn criticism. They were given the roles in recognition for their leadership in the unprecedented protests which toppled Hasina.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today, two remain in the cabinet, and critics say some controversial decisions, such as the temporary ban on the Awami League, were made under student pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The government has at times complied with some of the populist demands, particularly by the students, fearing more threatening protests could otherwise erupt. However, that was the exception rather than the rule,\" Mr Bergman says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, an exiled leader from the Awami League alleges that the party's supporters are being silenced by not being allowed to contest the next poll - with most of its leaders in exile or in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The elections will not be inclusive without the participation of the Awami League,\" Mohammad Ali Arafat, former minister in Hasina's cabinet, tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In its latest report, the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/authoritarian-system-yet-be-taken-apart-39\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Transparency International Bangladesh (TIB) said there had been an alarming rise in mob violence</a> while extra-judicial killings and deaths in custody had persisted in the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have overthrown an authoritarian regime, but unless we put an end to the authoritarian practices, we cannot really create a new Bangladesh,\" Iftekhar Zaman, the executive director of the TIB, said during the launch of the report earlier this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Bangladesh stands at a crossroads, the next six months will be critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some argue that, if there are no meaningful changes to the chequered political system, the sacrifices of those killed in the uprising could be rendered meaningless. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Now, they fuel her fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Between 2018 and 2024, those panels were installed at Rubí and Clemesí, two massive solar plants in Peru's Moquegua region, about 1,000 kilometres south of the capital, Lima. Together, they form the country's largest solar complex – and one of the biggest in Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">From her home in the small settlement of Pampa Clemesí, Rosa can see the rows of panels glowing under white floodlights. The Rubí plant is just 600 metres away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet her home – and the rest of her village – remains in total darkness, unconnected to the grid the plant feeds into.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The Rubí solar plant can be seen from various spots throughout the town</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Power from the sun, but not at home</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">None of Pampa Clemesí's 150 residents have access to the national power grid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few have solar panels donated by Rubí's operator, Orygen, but most can't afford the batteries and converters needed to make them work. At night, they use torches – or simply live in the dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The paradox is striking: the Rubí solar power plant produces around 440 GWh a year, enough to supply electricity to 351,000 homes. Moquegua, where the plant is located, is an ideal site for solar energy, receiving over 3,200 hours of sunshine annually, more than most countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that contradiction becomes even sharper in a country currently experiencing a renewable energy boom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2024 alone, electricity generation from renewables grew by 96%. Solar and wind power depend heavily on copper due to its high conductivity – and Peru is the world's second-largest producer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Peru, the system was designed around profitability. No effort was made to connect sparsely populated areas,\" explains Carlos Gordillo, an energy expert at the University of Santa María in Arequipa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Orygen says it has fulfilled its responsibilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've joined the government project to bring electricity to Pampa Clemesí and have already built a dedicated line for them. We also completed the first phase of the electrification project, with 53 power towers ready to operate,\" Marco Fragale, Orygen's executive director in Peru, told BBC News Mundo, the BBC's Spanish-language service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fragale adds that nearly 4,000 metres of underground cable were installed to provide a power line for the village. The $800,000 investment is complete, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the lights still haven't come on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The final step – connecting the new line to individual homes – is the government's responsibility. According to the plan, the Ministry of Mines and Energy must lay about two kilometres of wiring. Work was slated to begin in March 2025, but hasn't started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">BBC News Mundo tried to contact the Ministry of Mines and Energy but received no response.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Residents gather for dinner in darkness, illuminated only by a solar-powered torch</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A daily struggle for basics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rosa's tiny house has no sockets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each day, she walks around the village, hoping someone can spare a bit of electricity to charge her phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's essential,\" she says, explaining she needs the device to stay in touch with her family near the border with Bolivia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the few people who can help is Rubén Pongo.

But as the economy has waned post-Pandemic - and with multiple trade wars on the horizon - the market may be drying up.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the whiskey, which is traditionally made with corn and aged in charred oak barrels, has roots going all the way back to the 18th Century, it wasn't until 1964 that it became an iconic piece of Americana, when Congress passed a law declaring it a \"distinctive product of the United States\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But drinking trends come and go, and by the end of the 20th Century, bourbon was considered a bit old fashioned - pun intended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You often see these kind of generational shifts where people don't want to drink what their parents drink,\" said Marten Lodewijks, the US president of IWSR, which collects alcoholic beverage data and provides industry analysis. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then, as the world recovered from the 2008 recession, drinkers seemed to rediscover this classic spirit, for a few different reasons. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For starters, the price point was good, which made it attractive for bar managers to purchase and incorporate into cocktails and for younger drinkers to sample. Then, in 2013, a law was passed in Kentucky that made it easier for companies to purchase and resell vintage bottles, opening up a high-end collectible market. Add to that the rise in mid-century nostalgia fuelled by shows like Mad Men, and bourbon was due for a full-blown Renaissance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sales of bourbon grew by 7% worldwide between 2011-2020, which is more than three times the growth of the decade prior, according to industry data company ISWR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Soon, some bourbon distillers were becoming quasi-celebrities, and people were starting to buy up bourbon bottles not to drink, but as an investment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Everyone was going crazy over the bourbon market, and treating like a commodity, like a stock,\" recalls Robin Wynne, a general manager and beverage director for Little Sister in Toronto, Canada, who has been a bar manager for about 25 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People would go in as a prospector, to flip bottles for two to three times the value.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But like most market bubbles, this one was bound to burst. The pandemic's lockdowns tanked bar sales, and inflation has made many would-be bourbon drinkers choose less expensive options - or forgo drinking all together. Amongst Gen-Z, many 20-somethings <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220920-why-gen-zers-are-growing-up-sober-curious\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">are drinking less</a> than their older siblings and parents did at their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those factors have contributed to declining alcohol sales, with bourbon sales specifically slowing down to just 2% between 2021-2024, according to ISWR data. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Donald Trump's global tariffs have been the final straw. The EU has announced retaliatory tariffs against US goods, including Kentucky bourbon and Californian wine, although implementation has been delayed for six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, most provinces in Canada have stopped importing American alcoholic beverages in retaliation. The country accounts for about 10% of Kentucky's $9bn (£6.7bn) whiskey and bourbon business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves ... that's a very disproportionate response,\" Lawson Whiting, the CEO of Brown-Forman, which produces Jack Daniels, Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, said back in March when Canadian provinces announced their plan to stop buying US booze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has said that tariffs will boost made-in-American businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Republican Senator Rand Paul, who represents Kentucky, said the tariffs will hurt local businesses and consumers in his home state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Well, tariffs are taxes, and when you put a tax on a business, it's always passed through as a cost. So, there will be higher prices,\" he told ABC's \"This Week\" in May.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba99/live/460b1450-74b1-11f0-b0db-0dffb4fc96e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A long wooden hall is flanked by stacks of wooden bourbon barrels on either side, with industrial lights illuminating the way\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">There are 86 distilleries in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers' Association, and over 10 million barrels of bourbon aging </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These economic pressures have created a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Liquor giant Diageo, reported that sales of Bulleit, a Kentucky distillery that makes bourbon, rye and whiskey, where down 7.3% this fiscal year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wild Turkey - a Kentucky bourbon owned by Campari - sales were down 8.1% over the past six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While big, international brands will likely be able to weather the storm, the sales hit has led to a growing list of casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In July, LMD Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy - just one month after opening the Luca Mariano Distillery in Danville, Kentucky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This spring, Garrard County Distilling went into receivership.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And in January, Jack Daniel's parent company closed a barrel-making plant in Kentucky.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The bottom of the barrel has not yet been reached, warned Mr Lodewijks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'd be extraordinarily surprised if there weren't more bankruptcies and more consolidation,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In part, bourbon has become a victim of its own success - the rise in bourbon sales, and the growth of the premium market, helped fuel many small distilleries. Because bourbon must age in barrels for years, what's on the market today was predicted a few years ago, which means that there is currently an oversupply, which is driving down prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while these economic conditions are harsh, Mr Lodewijks said that history has shown how tough times can create innovation. Scotch whisky used to be fairly simple, a blend of middle-of-the road tipples. But when sales declined in the second part of the 20th century, distillers started aging their excess bottles, which helped create the market we have now for premium, aged Scotch whisky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Canada, where bourbon imports have slowed to a trickle, local distilleries have started experimenting with bourbon-making methods to give Canadian whiskey a similar taste.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The tariff war has really done a positive for the Canadian spirits business,\" noted Mr Wynne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We've got lots of grains to make these whiskeys without having to rely on the States.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's no longer the hot topic at happy hour here in San Francisco. But DeepSeek hasn't disappeared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DeepSeek challenged certain key assumptions about AI that had been championed by American executives like Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We were on a path where bigger was considered better,\" according to Sid Sheth, CEO of AI chip startup d-Matrix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps maxing out on data centres, servers, chips, and the electricity to run it all wasn't the way forward after all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite DeepSeek ostensibly not having access to the most powerful tech available at the time, Sheth told the BBC that it showed that \"with smarter engineering, you actually can build a capable model\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The surge of interest in DeepSeek took hold over a weekend in late January, before corporate IT personnel could move to stop employees from flocking to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When organisations caught on the following Monday, many scrambled to ban workers from using the app as worries set in about whether user data was potentially being shared with the People's Republic of China, where DeepSeek is based.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But while exact numbers aren't available, plenty of Americans still use DeepSeek today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Certain Silicon Valley start-ups have opted to stick with DeepSeek in lieu of more expensive AI models from US firms in a bid to cut down on costs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One investor told me for cash-strapped firms, funds saved by continuing to use DeepSeek are helping to pay for critical needs such as additional headcount. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They are, however, being careful. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In online forums, users explain how to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/article/how-to-run-deepseek-r-1-locally\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">run DeepSeek-R1 on their own devices</a> rather than online using DeepSeek's servers in China - a workaround they believe can protect their data from being shared surreptitiously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's a good way to use the model without being concerned about what it's exfiltrating\" to China, said Christopher Caen, CEO of Mill Pond Research.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">US-China rivalry</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/449c/live/ab33ebb0-6e24-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images People watch and learn about the Enflame DeepSeek all-in-one machine with DTU 3.0 chip at the 2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, China on July 28, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DeepSeek's arrival also marked a turning point in the US-China AI rivalry, some experts say.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"China was seen as playing catch-up in large language models until this point, with competitive models but always trailing the best western ones,\" policy analyst Wendy Chang of the Mercator Institute for China Studies told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A large language model (LLM) is a reasoning system trained to predict the next word in a given sentence or phrase. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DeepSeek changed perceptions when it claimed to have achieved a leading model for a fraction of the computational resources and costs common among its American counterparts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OpenAI had spent $5bn (£3.7bn) in 2024 alone.

released by the American AI giant in five years, well before ChatGPT ushered in the consumer AI era.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can draw a straight line from DeepSeek to what OpenAI announced this week,\" said d-Matrix's Sheth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"DeepSeek proved that smaller, more efficient models could still deliver impressive performance—and that changed the industry's mindset,\" Sheth told the BBC. \"What we're seeing now is the next wave of that thinking: a shift toward right-sized models that are faster, cheaper, and ready to deploy at scale.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But to others, for the major American players in AI, the old approach appears to be alive and well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Just days after releasing the free models, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5.

He was an heir to Sona Comstar, a $3.6bn (£2.7bn) business empire he inherited from his father. The company, among India's top auto component makers, has a global footprint with 10 plants spread across India, China, Mexico and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A polo enthusiast, Kapur moved in the elite social circles of Indian capital Delhi, and reportedly shared a friendship with Prince William.

That same study also found the share of single-person households in the capital had reached nearly 40% - that alarmed a government that has been trying to reverse plummeting birth and marriage rates.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfd6/live/16070690-7445-11f0-96b1-9b22c6b2158f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Jake Kwon/ BBC People sitting on chairs and beanbags and watching a movie together.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Jake Kwon/ BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The stores, which resemble a living room at home, offer comfort and company  </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The day the BBC visited, around a dozen visitors - men and women, young and old - were sitting on benches or burrowed into beanbags, watching a film together.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have movie days to encourage low-level bonding,\" whispers Kim Se-heon, the manager of the city's Loneliness Countermeasure Division.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The stores are designed to offer a warm, cafe-like atmosphere.

But years of migration to cities have shrunk families and turned places like Seoul into sprawling metropolises. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unaffordable housing, rising costs and gruelling working hours have led more and more young people to reject marriage or parenthood, or both.

Older people were dying alone at home, and their bodies were not discovered until days or weeks later. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That mission soon expanded to tackling loneliness itself. But Seoul is not the first to do this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2018, the UK appointed a Minister for Loneliness.

The choice of name - \"convenience stores\" - was a deliberate attempt to distance them from psychiatric clinics, important in a country where there is still a stigma against asking for help for mental health - especially among older residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And yet, some of their reservations can still be seen when they walk through the door for the first time, compounded by their experience of isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Visitors are often uncomfortable speaking to another person or eating together initially, store manager Lee says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The typical loneliness, if that repeats for days, months, and half year, that is now more than a feeling,\" Lee explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Those folks start to avoid places with people.

Added worries over pace ace Jasprit Bumrah's fitness further dimmed India's prospects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Losing the first Test at Headingley from a winning position, as England chased 373 in the fourth innings, confirmed pundits' doubts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But India recovered from this setback in style to win the next Test at Edgbaston by a whopping 336 runs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The swift turnaround came not from luck but skill and relentless determination - qualities that defined India's performance for the rest of the series.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The three Tests that followed were bitterly fought, both teams raising the intensity and skill levels, matching each other blow-for-blow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This sparked frequent heated clashes but also unforgettable acts of heroism, with players from both sides battling fatigue and injury to keep their teams in the fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some aspects of what kept India in the fight right through the neck-and-neck contest comes through in the stats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three batters - Gill, Rahul and Jadeja - topped 500 runs in the series. England had one, Joe Root. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were 12 centuries made by India, England had nine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mohammed Siraj with 23 was the highest wicket-taker from either side. The only bowler to take 10 wickets in a match was Akash Deep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Failures were scant, heroes were plenty, but the pillars of India's extraordinary show in the series were Gill and Siraj.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gill, in Bradmanesque form, made 754 runs, 430 of them coming in one Test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He failed by a mere 20 runs to break Sunil Gavaskar's record series aggregate, and was also second to Don Bradman (810) for highest runs made in a series by a captain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To be mentioned alongside Bradman and Gavaskar testifies to Gill's achievement and potential. His prolific scoring earned his team's full respect, and after a hesitant start, he quickly grew in confidence, showing fine temperament and smart tactics in tough situations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/248e/live/c79bee70-7431-11f0-876e-092c0a90f4e0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images India's Akash Deep (L) and India's Yashasvi Jaiswal 2L) celebrate winning the final Test cricket match between England and India at The Oval in London on August 4, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The future looks rosy for the young Indian team</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj, who since his 2021 debut had lived in the shadows of Bumrah and Shami, emerged so spectacularly that he instantly entered cricket folklore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Feisty and indefatigable, he bowled with a lion's heart - steaming in at full tilt, sparing his body no mercy, embracing the spearhead's role in Bumrah's absence, and inspiring the other pacers to bowl out of their skins - earning universal awe and admiration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Siraj's 23 wickets came at an average of 32.43, with an economy rate of 4.02 and a strike rate of 48.43 - hardly earth-shattering figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In India's two victories, he was the decisive force. At Edgbaston, his six wickets in the first innings (seven overall) swung the match firmly in India's favour. At the Oval, he took nine wickets - four in the first innings and five in the second - turning the match on its head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">How India held their nerve for 25 days under immense pressure - driven by willpower, ambition, and skill - culminating in a thrilling final 56-minute comeback at the Oval to win and level the series, is one of Test cricket's most riveting tales.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also marked this Indian young team's transition from apprehension and misgivings one of rich promise fuelled by ambition and excellence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The future looks rosy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And when asked the following day whether he was giving Israel a \"green light\", he instead spoke about the US strikes on Iran earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Washington's Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was even more direct - and his answer was that Netanyahu's Gaza plan is not America's concern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" he said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has faced some opposition to his plan - notably from the Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had argued against a full-scale occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the event, an announcement after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet did not say Israel would take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, but rather that it would \"prepare for taking control of Gaza City\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It did, however, mention that one of five principles for ending the war was \"Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some have suggested a full takeover of Gaza has always been on the table. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Netanyahu had always planned to take over Gaza, he just was waiting for the right moment,\" Amin Saikal, emeritus professor of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has suggested Israel does not want to keep the territory, however, but \"hand it over to Arab forces\" - without specifying which. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the plan, however, the Trump administration is not giving Netanyahu any public indication that he is wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That represents a marked change in White House policy. Trump previously had been more than willing to outline his views on Gaza's future - even when it caught Netanyahu and the Israelis by surprise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Americans also expressed their unhappiness with Israeli attacks on Syria last month - publicly disapproving, while offering even sharper criticism in private.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bibi acted like a madman,\" a White House official told the news website Axios. \"He bombs everything all the time.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As recently as a month ago, the White House was optimistic that a deal was within reach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire,\" Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a \"lasting peace in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But just over two weeks later, ceasefire talks had collapsed, and Witkoff was publicly accusing Hamas of being selfish and not acting in good faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hamas didn't really want to make a deal,\" Trump said on 25 July. \"I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, that will become apparent soon enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Trump administration has got a lot of leverage, \" said Prof Saikal of the Australian National University. \"I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on,\" Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. These moves were designed to bring additional pressure on Israel to wind down its military operations and reach a negotiated settlement with Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both represent a tacit acknowledgement that the current situation is untenable, and that a negotiated peace is further away than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, there is no telling how long this trend will last.

Paul Biya</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 92, Paul Biya is the world's oldest serving head of state. He has been in power for nearly 43 years since 1982. Biya leads the ruling CPDM party which dominates the political scene. He is widely considered the favourite, now that his main rival, Kamto, is out of the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The veteran politician has never lost an election since the return of multi-party politics in 1990. However, his victories have been marred by allegations of vote rigging – claims which his party and the government have continuously denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing his intention to run, Biya said his eighth mandate would focus on the wellbeing of women and young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"2.-bello-bouba-maigari\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">2. Bello Bouba Maigari</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bello Bouba Maigari, 78, is an experienced politician who hails from Cameroon's vote-rich northern region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the president of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) party founded in 1990. He served in the governments of both of Cameroon's presidents -Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In fact, he was Biya's first prime minister between 1982 and 1983. Since 1997, Maigari has forged an alliance with Biya's CPDM party that helped the latter clinch significant votes from the north. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, this political marriage ended in June following pressure from within his party to run independently. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While serving as Minister of State for Tourism and Leisure, Maigari announced his resignation and declared himself a candidate against Biya, who he also faced in the 1992 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"3.-issa-tchiroma-bakary\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">3. Issa Tchiroma Bakary</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another former Biya ally whose candidacy came as a surprise is 75-year-old Issa Tchiroma Bakary. Like Maigari, he is from the country's north and has been influential in helping Biya secure the region's votes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After a 20-year stint in different government roles, Tchiroma finally pulled the plug on his time with the 92-year-old leader, resigning from his role as Minister of Employment and Vocational Training to announce his candidacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tchiroma, who heads the Cameroon National Salvation Front (CNSF) party, criticised Biya's governance style and hinged his presidential bid on a promise to overhaul the system, which he described as \"suffocating\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A man painted in green and white colours \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Supporters of Joshua Osih came out in donned in party colours when he campaigned in the 2018 election, but he came fourth</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"4.-cabral-libii\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">4.

Akere Muna</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Akere Muna was a candidate in the 2018 presidential election but pulled out at the last minute and threw his weight behind Kamto. This time around, Muna, a staunch international anti-corruption lawyer, says he wants to challenge Biya himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 72-year-old is from a family of politicians - his late father Solomon Tandeng Muna served as Prime Minister of West Cameroon after independence, Vice-President of the then Federal Republic of Cameroon and Speaker of the National Assembly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Speaker, Solomon Muna swore in Biya when he took over as president after Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Muna is promising to rid the bilingual country of the corruption and bad governance that he says have soiled its image at the international scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"6.-joshua-osih\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">6.

The SDF used to be the country's main opposition outfit, but its influence later dwindled, exacerbated by infighting and the expulsion of several party members in 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Osih, 56, came fourth in the 2018 polls with 3%, but is hoping to defeat Biya through a promise of social and institutional reforms.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57eb/live/2c4e0b70-6ac1-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A close-up shot of Maurice Kamto.

Since becoming a member of parliament in the process, he has challenged the government on key policy issues, promising sweeping changes if he takes over the reins of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Dr Hugues says Libii's vision is opaque, citing Akere Muna as a more convincing candidate with a much clearer project for the nation of nearly 30 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Muna has a wealth of international experience and diplomatic character, and that is what the nation needs now,\" he said, while praising the renowned lawyer's five-year transition plan to \"put the nation back on track\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Could the opposition unite?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Historically, Cameroon's opposition has been fragmented especially during elections, with analysts saying this has disadvantaged them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of this year's presidential election, there has been much talk about the need for the opposition to unite and harmonise strategies to take on Biya.

The treated water was by definition safe to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem was that under EU law, \"natural mineral water\" – which sells at a huge premium over tap water – is supposed to be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle. That is the whole point of it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If brands like Evian, Vichy and Perrier have been so successful in France and around the world, it is thanks to an appealing image of mountain-sides, rushing streams, purity and health-giving minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Admit filtering the water, and the industry risks breaking the market spell.  Consumers might begin to ask what they'd been paying for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Complicating matters for Perrier and its parent company Nestlé – as well as President Emmanuel Macron's government – is the charge that executives and ministers conspired to keep the affair quiet, covered up reports of contamination, and re-wrote the rules so that Perrier could continue using micro-filtration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their investigations, Le Monde and Radio France alleged that the government considered the mineral water industry so strategic that it agreed to suppress damaging information. A senate inquiry into the affair accused the government of a \"deliberate strategy\" of \"dissimulation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to the allegations, the government has asked the European Commission to rule on what level of micro-filtration is permissible for \"natural mineral water\". Aurelien Rousseau, who was head of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne's cabinet at the time, admitted there had been an \"error of appreciation\" but insisted there was never any risk to public health.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images French Senator Alexandre Ouizille (C), flanked by French Senators Laurent Burgoa (L) and Antoinette Guhl (R), presents the Senate commission of enquiry report about French industrial mineral waters during a press conference at the French Senate, Upper house of the French Parliament, in Paris on May 19, 2025\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A senate report concluded that France's government covered up the water scandal \"at the highest level\" </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, at the senate hearing into the industry, Nestlé's CEO Laurent Freixe admitted that Perrier had indeed used illicit methods to treat its water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also had another admission: that an official hydrologists' report into the company's historic site in the Gard department in southern France had recommended against renewing \"natural mineral water\" status for the company's output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It raises the possibility that for the first time in its 160-year history, Perrier water may soon not be labelled as what people assume it to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the hydrologist Emma Haziza, \"the link to climate change and global warming is absolutely established\". And if Perrier is feeling the impact ahead of other companies, it is probably because its geographical location sets it apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Far from the remote mountain landscape you might imagine, Perrier's water is pumped from deep aquifers in the coastal plain between Nîmes and Montpellier, a short drive from the Mediterranean. The area is populous, heavily-farmed, and very hot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There has been a big climatic shift since 2017,\" says Haziza. \"For five years there was a succession of droughts, which were particularly badly felt in the south.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Emma Haziza says climate change is causing a lot of problems in the south of France</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All the aquifers were affected. This means not just the upper water-table, which is where everyday tap water comes from. We can now see that the deeper aquifers – which the companies thought were protected – are also being hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The unforeseen is taking place. We are moving from a period in which companies could draw water from the deep aquifers and be sure they would be replenished, to a period in which it's obvious the whole system cannot go on.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The analysis made by Haziza and other hydrologists is that there is now a clear link between deeper and surface aquifers. Contaminants (farm chemicals or human waste) that drain off the land in the increasingly frequent flash floods, can now make their way into the lower aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, the effects of long-term drought and over-pumping mean these lower aquifers contain less volume, so any contamination will be more concentrated, the experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can foresee that what has happened first at Perrier's site will happen to other producers in the years to come. That's why we need to move away from our current model of consumption,\" says Haziza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong insists their water is \"100%\" pure</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year at the Perrier site, three million bottles had to be destroyed because of a contamination. But the company insists that any problems are swiftly detected; and it disputes the claim that contaminants are entering the deep aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are pumping water from 130 metres underground, beneath layers of limestone,\" says Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong. \"We are 100% convinced of the purity of the water. And its mineral make-up is constant.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says there is no EU ruling that specifically bans micro-filtration. The relevant text simply says that nothing must be done to disinfect or alter the mineral make-up of the water. The argument is over at what measure of micro-filtration alteration begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The original Perrier source was first tapped by a local doctor in the 1860s, but it was under British management that the brand took off 50 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">St John Harmsworth – brother of newspaper magnates Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere – made Perrier a byword for mineral water across the British empire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to company lore, Harmsworth took inspiration for the bottles' bulbous shape from the Indian clubs he used for exercise following a crippling car accident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today the bottling plant at Vergèze is still next to Harmsworth's residence and the original source. The plant has been heavily automated. A rail track connects with the SNCF network to bring hundreds of millions of cans and bottles every year to Marseille for export.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier's bottling plant is still next to the water's original source at Vergèze</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The focus for the last year has been on a new brand: Maison Perrier. These energy and flavoured drinks are proving highly successful in France and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The advantage for Perrier is that the new beverages do not claim to be \"natural mineral water\". They can be treated and filtered without difficulty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says the new brand is part of the mix, and that it has no intention of abandoning its original Source Perrier natural mineral water. It has stopped the ultra-fine (0.2 micron) microfiltration, and now uses a 0.45 micron system which has been agreed with government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has applied for \"natural mineral water\" status for just two out of the five drilling wells it was using for Perrier mineral water. A decision is due later this year.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Sign up here.</a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
