Others come across as vague and imprecise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's sovereignty would be \"<i id='confirmed\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">confirmed\" </i>and there would be a <i id='\"total-and-complete-comprehensive-non-aggression-agreement-between-russia,-ukraine-and-europe\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\"</i>, with robust or reliable <i id='\"security-guarantees\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"security guarantees\"</i> for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Russia were to invade Ukraine a <i id='\"robust-co-ordinated-military-response\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"robust co-ordinated military response\"</i> is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Handover of Ukraine's territory and cut in armed forces</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukrainian-forces-will-withdraw-from-the-part-of-donetsk-oblast-that-they-currently-control,-and-this-withdrawal-zone-will-be-considered-a-neutral-demilitarized-buffer-zone,-internationally-recognized-as-territory-belonging-to-the-russian-federation.-russian-forces-will-not-enter-this-demilitarised-zone.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"the-size-of-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-will-be-limited-to-600,000-personnel.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft also proposes that \"<i id='crimea,-luhansk-and-donetsk-will-be-recognized-as-de-facto-russian,-including-by-the-united-states\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\"</i>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ukraine's future - with EU but not Nato</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-agrees-to-enshrine-in-its-constitution-that-it-will-not-join-nato-and-nato-agrees-to-include-in-its-statutes-a-provision-that-ukraine-will-not-be-admitted-in-the-future.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-is-eligible-for-eu-membership-and-will-get-short-term-preferred-market-access-to-the-european-market-while-this-issue-is-being-evaluated.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland.

Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What about Russia's frozen assets?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested<i id='\"in-us-led-efforts-to-rebuild-and-invest-in-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\"</i>, with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rest of those frozen assets would go to a <i id='\"us-russian-investment-vehicle\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"US-Russian investment vehicle\"</i>, under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is not in the plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is this a definitive peace plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Equally US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is the draft a Putin wishlist?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow.

One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One point is explicit but even-handed:<i id='\"both-countries-will-agree-to-abolish-all-discriminatory-measures-and-guarantee-the-rights-of-ukrainian-and-russian-media-and-education.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe - <i id='\"equally-between-russia-and-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"equally between Russia and Ukraine\"</i>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Their body language was relaxed – particularly Trump's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not only did Trump refrain from attacking Mamdani, he praised him numerous times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president expressed hope that Mamdani would be a \"really great mayor\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the president added he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Brushing off questions about jihad and fascism</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/67af/live/26f109b0-c774-11f0-b0e6-6b19d8000d31.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Mamdani is seen standing next to Trump, who is seated behind his desk in the Oval Office.

As consumers grow restless about the cost of groceries, housing and other essentials, Trump has tried to convey a message of economic stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his election campaign in New York City, Mamdani maintained a laser focus on the lack of affordable housing and proposed freezing rent increases on certain rent-stabilised apartments, among other initiatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani said he and Trump discussed how to \"deliver affordability to New Yorkers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whenever he was asked a question about their differing views, the mayor-elect brought the conversation back to this topic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Facing one question about their different views on achieving peace in the Middle East, Mamdani responded that Trump voters had expressed to him a wish for \"an end to forever wars\" and for leaders to address \"the cost-of-living crisis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On law enforcement and immigration, they also appeared to find some common ground. Mamdani said he and Trump discussed federal immigration-enforcement operations in New York, and he relayed concerns from residents about how they are being conducted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump said they discussed crime more than immigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He doesn't want to see crime and I don't want to see crime,\" the president said. He had \"very little doubt\" the two wouldn't get along on that issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump even said he would feel safe living in a Mamdani-led New York.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A complication for Republicans' strategy? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cordial relations on display on Friday may complicate efforts by Republicans to use the self-described democratic socialist as a bogeyman in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, when control of the US Congress will be up for grabs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In elections earlier this month, Republicans struggled and Democrats won key races. It's unclear whether that trend will hold. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans had plans in place to make Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party, according to US news site Axios. They included painting him as anti-police, anti-capitalism and anti-Israel in an effort to give Republicans a leg-up in key races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Oval Office chuminess could undercut that strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While praising Mamdani, the president said he believed the new mayor would \"surprise some conservative people\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

After a few matches in Bengaluru, the venue for the knockouts has now moved to Sri Lanka's capital Colombo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 16-member Indian squad represents nine states - Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Assam, and Bihar. Many players were introduced to the sport through schoolteachers, disability organisations, or community camps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most of the players are from rural backgrounds,\" said team manager Shika Shetty. \"Language and culture were barriers, families and teachers were often unwilling to let them pursue the sport, and even introducing the rules of blind cricket took time. But now they are all competing with pride.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blind cricket uses a plastic ball with metal bearings that jingle, and players are grouped by sight: B1 (fully blind), B2 and B3. Teams must field a mix of all three. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground. B1 batters use runners for safety, and each run they score counts as two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World Cup features six teams in a single round-robin. India won all five matches and were the first side to qualify for the semi-finals.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is on the team?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ce49/live/fdcb59e0-c693-11f0-9f25-7941d4a3a13a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Cricket Association for the Blind in India Deepika TC, the captain of India's blind women's cricket team pictured running with her bat. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Cricket Association for the Blind in India</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">India is led by Deepika TC who lost her vision to an accident as a child</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's team is captained by Deepika TC, a Karnataka native who lost her sight as a baby after an accident. She grew up in a farming family, unaware that sport would define her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cricket reached her through specialised schools, where teachers encouraged her to try the game despite her hesitation. Over time, the sport gave her direction and confidence, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leading India in the World Cup carries deep meaning for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the biggest moment of my and my team's life. Earlier this month, the sighted Indian women's cricket team won the World Cup in Navi Mumbai, and we want to make it a double this month,\" Deepika said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said support from Indian women's World Cup winner Jemimah Rodrigues and men's Test captain Shubman Gill had been very meaningful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vice-captain Ganga Kadam of Maharashtra, from a family of nine siblings, was enrolled in a school for the blind by her farmer father to secure a stable future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She played cricket casually until a mentor urged her to take it seriously. Learning to trust sound, timing, and orientation was challenging. The 26-year-old's progress came through persistence rather than immediate results, and she now inspires visually impaired girls in her village to play sports.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Team India shine at first T20 World Cup for blind women</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another on the team, top-order batter Anekha Devi, 20, from Jammu and Kashmir, was born partially blind. Her uncle, also visually impaired, urged her to attend a blind cricket camp in Delhi after school. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She remembers early sessions as overwhelming, with unfamiliar voices and techniques. But she adapted quickly and surprised coaches with her grasp of the audible ball system. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Within two years she reached the national team and often speaks of wanting to become the role model she never had for herself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her 18-year-old all-rounder teammate, Phula Saren, from a tribal community in Odisha, lost vision in her left eye at five, as well as her mother soon after. She discovered cricket through a teacher at a school for the blind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Travelling to tournaments was challenging, and persuading her family took time, but she persisted. Her turning point wasn't a trophy -  it was realising she belonged at the national level.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Sunita Sarathe from Madhya Pradesh didn't step into cricket directly from school.

It has firmly denied claims of a white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it wouldn't take part in any discussions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters earlier this week that there's only one way they would not attend next year's meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are members of the G20, we're not an invited country. So we don't need an invitation from anybody,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way they can do it is to decline us visas.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump show President Cyril Ramaphosa a pile of documents\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">At a meeting earlier this year, Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, with widely discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of the world's wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will not attach much weight to [the US' absence],\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for real consensus, because people won't be constantly looking over their shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his positioning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint declaration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Answering reporters' questions at the summit's venue in Johannesburg on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this sentiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries that are present must make a decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that we must adopt a leaders' declaration because the institution cannot be bogged down by someone who's absent,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaders' declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy, including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change. It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump isn't the only head of state who will not be attending. China's Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has represented the president in a number of meetings this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian leader <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64992727\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Vladimir Putin will also be absent due to the International Criminal Court's warrant against him</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be attending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping the summit in solidarity with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior delegations to represent their countries' interests.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences, saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and it is \"nothing abnormal\" for them to send a replacement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other global powers have expressed their support of South Africa's presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union, which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries have long argued that processing minerals in their countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing much-needed development, jobs and income.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in this current cycle. It's also the last country in the global south to host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As such, the South African government says it wants to use its presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared prosperity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although building consensus through multilateral institutions like the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges, whether it's climate change, demographic shifts, technological revolution and so on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society. And you can't deal with them unless there is international collaboration and cooperation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral organisations do little to change real people's lives, preferring instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done through one-on-one deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, South Africa's presidency of the G20 is part of a wider debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that consensus can be reached without the participation of the world's most powerful country.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More BBC stories about South Africa:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

So far 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes, according to US statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the campaign is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration justifies them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives by stopping drugs from entering the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the strikes have attracted condemnation in countries in the region and concern that they breach international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has criticised the strikes, saying Colombian citizens were on board the boat hit on 15 September, and later claiming Mr Carranza was among those killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to his first statement about Colombian citizens being killed, the White House said it looked forward to President Petro \"publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also accused Petro of encouraging the production of drugs and threated to cut off US aid to Colombia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza comes from a huge family, living with about 20 relatives in a small house off a dirt track in the fishing village of Gaira.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Petro <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa/Paginas/La-sociedad-norteamericana-debe-saber-que-estan-asesinando-gente-pobre-251108.aspx\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged</a> that he wanted to help his daughter study at university, and so accepted a payment from a drug trafficker to transport some drugs to an island, when his boat was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But whether it was fish or cocaine [he was transporting], he wasn't subject to the death penalty,\" Petro said. He accused the US of \"murder\" and since said he ordered Colombian public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the strikes end. His defence minister later said the president had given \"clear instructions to maintain, as has been done, a continuous flow of information with international agencies to combat drug trafficking\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza has a past criminal record over stealing weapons from the police nine years ago, but his family deny – and say they are hurt by – characterisations of him as a narco-trafficker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What the president of the United States is doing isn't right. He has to prove if they are or aren't [trafficking],\" Lizbeth says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says while Trump may want to tackle issues affecting his \"territory\" that \"doesn't mean he should resort to these methods… of taking someone's life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US lawyer working for some of Mr Carranza's family, Daniel Kovalik, who also works for President Petro, says Mr Carranza's wife and older daughter recognised his boat from the US-released footage of the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He intends to sue the US government on the family's behalf. International law says the military cannot kill civilians unless they pose an imminent threat of violence, even if engaging in criminal activity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if you claim that the people you're killing are trafficking drugs, you don't have the right to just engage in extrajudicial killings,\" Mr Kovalik said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're tiny boats… If you really believe they were doing something wrong, those people should be arrested, tried in a court of law, convicted, and sentenced.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And, by the way, none of them would be sentenced to the death penalty – this is not a capital crime.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has told Congress that it believes the US is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In doing so, it appears to be invoking war-time powers, such as killing enemy combatants even if they pose no immediate violent threat, to justify the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said the US is \"under threat\" from \"terrorist organisations\" and said drugs kill thousands of Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says seizures of cocaine – the major drug trafficked and produced in South America – rose by about 18% in 2024 compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the main driver of drug deaths in the US is Fentanyl, which is produced and arrives in the US from Mexico.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kovalik does not buy the US's self-defence argument, saying \"these boats have never attacked the United States\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Juan Assis Tejeda says he and his fellow fishermen are fearful they could be targeted by strikes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Taganga, the strikes are causing apprehension for fishermen like 81-year-old Juan Assis Tejeda, whose skin is tanned and leathered from 70 years fishing these waters under the Caribbean's baking sun – just like his grandfather and father before him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He regularly fishes near the border with Venezuela, just along the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He describes how he has sometimes seen drones flying over them while out fishing that \"hover quietly, come back again, and disappear\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though he is just fishing, he is now fearful because of the ongoing strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At any moment they could see us and think we're doing the same thing. Because sometimes we also go 60 miles or so out to sea, looking for tuna.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says some fishermen do get involved in transporting drugs due to poverty. He says he was once offered money himself, but he said no.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would prefer to stick to the little money that he earns and live \"peacefully\" than run the risks associated with transporting drugs, he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mr Tejeda says he has seen drones hovering while he has been out fishing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most in this region do not believe that this is just about targeting small, alleged drug-trafficking boats, but instead about the US also wanting to put military pressure on Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro to step aside – or on his allies, for example in the military, to oust him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US accuses Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation which it calls the Cartel de los Soles, something Maduro strongly denies. The US state department intends to designate this group a foreign terrorist organisation on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has added to growing speculation over whether the US will strike targets on Venezuelan soil itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said the US \"may be having some discussions with Maduro\" and Maduro responded by saying he would be prepared to talk \"face to face\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the US mulls its next move, the sleepy fishing villages that dot the Caribbean coast wonder whether diplomacy, or war, is on their horizon.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported have had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A rare deportation flight</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers. In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Torosian stands in front of the White House gate holding a sign that says: Iranian Christians ran from prison.

But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Life on hold for those left behind</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles.

They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly1ypqlle0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to end the war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which brings us back to the peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 28-point proposal, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">which has been widely leaked and reported on,</a> appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

It shot out like a jack in the box.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many. But not everyone.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymn8zyrp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">on Nato's Article 5</a>. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, though, Russia's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0yere4k0zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">war on Ukraine continues</a>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

Putin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Popova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Increasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/ukrayina-zaprovadila-sankciyi-proti-visokoposadovciv-derzhav-101253\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sanctions have been imposed on him</a> for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This behaviour ranged from misogynistic material to fight videos and content promoting eating disorders and suicide.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One in seven also reported experiencing grooming-type behaviour from adults or older children, and more than half said they had been the victims of cyberbullying.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What platforms are affected?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government has so far named ten platforms to be included in the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube, Reddit and streaming platforms Kick and Twitch. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also under pressure to expand the ban to online gaming. Fearing they may be targeted, gaming platforms such as Roblox and Discord <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">have recently introduced age checks</a> on some features in an apparent bid to ward off inclusion in the ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has said it will continue to review the list of affected platforms, and will consider three main criteria when doing so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These comprise whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube Kids, Google Classroom and WhatsApp are not included as they were not deemed to have met those criteria. Children will also still be available to view most content on platforms like YouTube, which do not require an account.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How will the ban be enforced?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children and parents will not be punished for infringing the ban - it is social media companies who are charged with enforcing it, and they face fines of up to $49.5m (US$32m, £25m) for serious or repeated breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says these companies must take \"reasonable steps\" to keep kids off their platforms, and use age assurance technologies - without specifying which ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several possibilities have been raised, including the use of government IDs, face or voice recognition and age inference.

As former Facebook executive Stephen Scheeler told AAP: \"It takes Meta about an hour and 52 minutes to make $50 million in revenue\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics argue that the ban, even if properly implemented, will not actually reduce online harm for children.

These protections stipulate that such information may not be used for anything other than age verification and must be destroyed once that has been done, with \"serious penalties\" for breaches. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also says platforms must offer an alternative to the use of governments IDs for age assurance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How have social media companies responded?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media companies were aghast at the announcement of the ban in November 2024. They argued it would be difficult to implement, easy to circumvent and time consuming for users, as well as posing risks to their privacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also suggested it would drive children into dark corners of the internet and deprive young people of social contact. Snap - which owns Snapchat - and YouTube also denied being social media companies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube's parent company, Google, is reportedly still considering whether to launch a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion.

Different approaches have been tried elsewhere to limit screen and social media time for children and keep them from accessing harmful material, but nowhere has put a total ban on the platforms involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0epennv98lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new safety rules</a> introduced in July mean online companies face large fines or even the jailing of their executives if they fail to implement measures to protect young people from seeing illegal and harmful content.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other European countries allow the use of social media under a certain age only with parental consent. In September, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkjep23403o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">French parliamentary enquiry</a> recommended banning under-15s from social media, as well as a social media \"curfew\" for 15- to 18-year-olds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has announced plans to ban social media for under-15s, while Norway is considering a similar proposal. Spain's government has sent to parliament a draft law for under-16s to require their legal guardians to authorise access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, an attempt in the US state of Utah to ban under-18s from social media without parental consent was blocked by a federal judge last year.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will children try to get around the ban?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Teens interviewed by the BBC said they were opening new accounts with fake ages ahead of the ban - although the government has warned social media companies it expects them to detect such accounts and remove them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online, teenagers are also recommending alternative social media apps or giving tips they hope will help them bypass the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some teens, including influencers, have switched to joint accounts with their parents.

The islands experienced tens of thousands of earthquakes - many of which were over magnitude 5.0 and could be felt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many tourists fled, and locals feared that the nearby underwater volcano, Kolumbo, might be about to erupt -  or that this was a seismic prelude to a larger earthquake, like the devastating, magnitude 7.7 quake that struck the same region in 1956.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Science, created a 3D map of the Earth around Santorini. They then mapped the evolving patterns of seismic activity of each tremor and the movement and stress in the crust. This resulted in a detailed model of exactly what drove this months-long seismic swarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team found that the event was driven by the horizontal movement of magma - from beneath Santorini and the Kolumbo volcano - through a 30km channel that is more than 10km beneath the seafloor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers estimated that the volume of magma that moved through the crust could have filled 200,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools. These \"magma intrusions\", as they are known, smashed through layers of rock, triggering thousands of tremors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lead author on the study, Anthony Lomax, a research geophysicist who develops scientific software to analyse seismic activity, explained: \"The tremors act as if we had instruments deep in the Earth, and they're telling us something.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[When we analyse] the pattern those earthquakes make in our 3D model of the Earth, it matches very, very well what we expect for magma moving horizontally.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Does this mean the Santorini unrest is over?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the researchers say, it appears to be over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The magma remained quite deep - more than 8km depth - in the crust,\" explained Dr Hicks. \"We know that magma can ascend and erupt at the surface in a matter of hours to days, but because the activity has now died down, we can be almost certain that the melt eventually got stuck and cooled down deep in the crust.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Volcanoes, though, can enter prolonged phases of unrest and unpredictability that can last many years. Recent volcanic activity in south-west Iceland has demonstrated that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And these researchers say using AI, in combination with the fundamental physics of how the Earth's crust moves and responds to stress, could transform the ability to monitor, understand and even forecast volcanic activity. This could help keep people in seismically active parts of the world safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ultimately, this could be used as a forecasting tool,\" explained Dr Hicks. Whenever we see a cluster of earthquakes, \"that is data that can be used to work out the most likely cause\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
