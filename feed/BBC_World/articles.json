I don't have anything to add at the moment.\" He did not say whether they would appeal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK condemned what it described as \"politically motivated persecution\" of Lai, saying he had been \"targeted... for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The UK has repeatedly called for the National Security Law to be repealed and for an end to the prosecution of all individuals charged under it,\" the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office said in a statement on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese government abused Jimmy Lai with the aim of silencing all those who dare to criticise the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],\" said Elaine Pearson, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, following the verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the face of the farce of Jimmy Lai's case, governments should pressure the authorities to withdraw the case and release him immediately.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Western governments, including the UK and US, have for years called for Lai's release, which Beijing and Hong Kong have rejected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump had earlier vowed to \"do everything to save\" Lai while UK PM Keir Starmer had said securing his release was a \"priority\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A test of judicial independence</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai's trial came to be widely seen as yet another test of judicial independence for Hong Kong's courts, which have been accused of toeing Beijing's line since 2019, when it tightened its control over the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong authorities insist the rule of law is intact but critics point to the hundreds of protesters and activists who have been jailed under the NSL - and its nearly 100% conviction rate as of May this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bail is also often denied in NSL cases and that was the case with Lai too, despite rights groups and Lai's children raising concerns about his deteriorating health. He has reportedly been held in solitary confinement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai's son Sebastien told the BBC earlier this year that his father's \"body is breaking down\" - \"Given his age, given his health... he will <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/cger51y928ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">die in prison</a>.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hong Kong government has also been criticised for barring foreign lawyers from working on NSL cases without prior permission. They said it was a national security risk, although foreign lawyers had operated in the city's courts for decades.

An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all feel frustrated and powerless. Yet, there must be an ending to the whole issue and time comes when it comes,\" a former Apple Daily journalist, who was also in court, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jimmy always said that he was indebted to Hong Kong... but I think Hong Kong and most Hong Kongers are so grateful to have him upholding the core values, good faith and integrity for the community at the expense of his well being and personal freedom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his testimony, Lai had said that he had \"never allowed\" his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he described as a \"conspiracy\" and \"too crazy to think about\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,\" he had said. These values, he added, include the \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change.

He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president.

Kast regularly drew links between the two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara.

They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this.

It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So has the US gone too far, I wondered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a process of negotiation. Of course, it would be good for us if nothing is given to Lukashenko, because all those people are hostages of his regime. They are innocent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But this is how negotiation goes,\" she replied, before noting that sanctions can always be reapplied if necessary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump now uses carrots.

This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it.

Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, EU nations <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkr83p73o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets</a> held in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official.

It added that six civilians had also been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, tensions continued to build.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.</p></div></div></body></html>"

As a result, about $110m worth of medicines were destroyed - estimated at up to 30% of Ukraine's monthly supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a missile and drone strike against our facility. The missiles flew past, but the drones hit it,\" said Dmytro Babenko, acting director-general of pharmaceutical distributor BADM.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They caused a fire which unfortunately proved impossible to contain and the whole facility was destroyed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BADM is one of two companies that supply about 85% of Ukrainian pharmacies in roughly equal shares.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other company is Optima Pharm, whose warehouses have been hit three times this year - on 28 August, 25 October and 15 November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The October attack destroyed its main storage facility in Kyiv, and cost the company more than $100m, says Optima Pharm's chief financial officer Artem Suprun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia denies hitting civilian targets, but when the Optima Pharm warehouse was hit in October, the defence ministry in Moscow said only that it had targeted a factory producing drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the day BADM's warehouse was destroyed, Russia said it had hit \"a warehouse storing military equipment\" as well as energy and transport infrastructure.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such attacks significantly complicate the treatment of sick and wounded in Ukraine,   after almost four years of Russia's full-scale war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Rescue Committee (IRC), an NGO that had been using the warehouse in Dnipro, says it lost $195,000 worth of medication and supplies, which could have served 30,000 people in need.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I arrived at the site I was devastated, the scene was simply awful. All of this medicine could have served people for years, and in a single moment it was all lost,\" says the IRC's Andriy Moskalenko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IRC said the Dnipro facility had served \"as a critical hub for hospitals, healthcare providers, pharmacies and humanitarian actors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Babenko from BADM said the Russian attack had destroyed \"vitally important medicines\" that had been imported and are not produced in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a pretty complicated situation,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he is hopeful that the attack will not leave Ukrainians without medicines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There won't be significant shortages, possibly only of certain types of goods. We're hoping to restore all supplies in a month or a month-and-a-half,\" Mr Babenko said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian authorities accuse Russia of deliberately targeting hospitals, ambulances, medics and rescue workers, claims Moscow has denied. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the government in Kyiv, more than 2,500 medical institutions have been damaged or destroyed, and more than 500 civilian doctors, nurses and other medical workers killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, the World Health Organization said it had recorded 2,763 attacks on Ukraine's healthcare system since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, and it said that in 2025 there had been a 12% increase in attacks from the previous year.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Say, a ceasefire along the line of contact; some areas demilitarised; no formal territorial recognition.

When Xi warned earlier in the conflict against Russian threats of nuclear weapon use, the Kremlin fell swiftly in line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's war machine is also hugely dependent on China's supply of dual use goods – such as electronics or machinery that can be used for civilian and military purposes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So if Beijing decided it was no longer in China's interests for the war to continue, then it would have substantial leverage over Kremlin thinking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the US shows no sign of trying to encourage – or force – China to put pressure on Moscow.

That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21z4zgkx7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">hostile takeover</a> bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said \"it's imperative that CNN be sold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4qwwk0g0yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount</a>, another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is \"superior\" to the Netflix deal.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A birds-eye view of the Warner Bros lot shows multiple large studios, with the studio at the centre emblazoned with the Warner Bros logo\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,\" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,\" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. \"He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros objected to that characterisation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,\" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,\" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered \"the talkies\" in 1927.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's a disaster,\" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. \"This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore.

I hoped they would accept me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His TikTok career also took off which gave him a steady income as fans sent him gifts as they watched his live streams. It also led to a threat on his life from the Somalia-based Islamist militant group al-Shabab because of his defence of the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Part of his asylum case in the US was based on that threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad describes in vivid detail the early May morning when immigration agents arrested him this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly after he had eaten breakfast, he went to his car thinking he was about to begin another day of Uber driving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Boom, they came for me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Mahad, he was taken on a 30-minute drive to the ICE headquarters serving Minneapolis and its twin city of St Paul, before being transferred on a six-hour journey to Kandiyohi County Jail Prison in Willmar, Minnesota, where he says he spent six months in detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He tells the BBC that three of those months were spent waiting for a decision on his asylum case, and the remaining three awaiting deportation. The authorities denied his asylum claim as they rejected the idea that he would be in danger in Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad says there were brief periods when he was transferred to Arizona, from where deportation fights leave, but he was told on each occasion that logistical arrangements were not ready.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one of these trips, he was part of a group of 39 detainees, including nationals of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, in a holding area for people waiting to board deportation flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Finally, when it came to his own departure, Mahad says he was put in a tight restraining jacket and travelled on a small plane with seven other deportees and some guards.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The journey first took them to Costa Rica, in Central America, then to Senegal in West Africa, before flying to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. There Mahad says the restraining jacket was removed and he was handcuffed and put on another plane to Mogadishu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having spent three months waiting to be deported, Mahad had already resigned himself to his fate and was not particularly emotional on his return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a decade apart, he has finally been reunited with his three children. \"I wouldn't trade this moment for anything now... I haven't seen them for 10 years,\" Mahad says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he would still prefer to be in the US because he fears for his life after receiving text messages from al-Shabab, containing death threats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He takes extra security precautions when he's out and lives in a well protected home but did not want to go into further details, or share the contents of the threats, for safety reasons.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images Warmly dressed demonstrators rally outside a shop.

He understands that because of his social media presence he may get opportunities not available to other Somalis deported - or threatened with deportation - from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, President Donald Trump said he would end the temporary protection status that is supposed to prevent people from being deported while their home country is unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, he upped the ante, saying that he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somalia has not had a central government in control of the whole country since the toppling of President Siad Barre in 1991. People have had to endure years of near anarchy and insecurity - and even now, despite a government being in place in Mogadishu, Islamist militants still dominate much of the country and occasionally stage attacks in the capital.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in US</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in the state of Minnesota's social assistance programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the state's government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of the president's remarks about Somalis, videos have circulated on social media appearing to show immigration agents knocking on doors across Minneapolis, which includes an area known as Little Mogadishu, and St Paul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many in the city's Somali community, the largest in the US and numbering around 80,000, the posts have triggered alarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also spoke to five young Somali men who now spend their days confined to a friend's small house, moving carefully through rooms that are not their own. They left their rented apartment abruptly last week not because they wanted to, but because the lease was under their names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As people who had been given temporary protected status, they feared it was only a matter of time before ICE traced the address and came for them. They grabbed what they could carry and slipped away in the night, hoping the change of location would offer some protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, their lives are suspended. Work shifts are missed. Meals are skipped or stretched. One of the men described how quickly everything has collapsed: \"We're running out of food. We haven't reported to work for the past five days because we're scared that ICE might be waiting for us. I don't know what will happen to us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad is far from being alone in being deported to Somalia in recent months, although there are no official figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also spoke to another young Somali man, who asked to remain anonymous.

I'm not sure what strategic purpose that would serve,\" Prof Stearns told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23's new offensive in South Kivu started a few days before Kagame and Tshisekedi flew to Washington last week to ratify the agreement first hammered out in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bram Verelst, a Burundi-based researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank, said the assault appeared to be an attempt to force Burundi to withdraw the troops it had in eastern DR Congo backing the army against the rebel forces and Rwanda.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Uvira - which lies just 27km (17 miles) from Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika - was of strategic importance because of the presence of at least 10,000 Burundian troops in South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Uvira is Burundi's gateway into eastern DR Congo, to send troops and supplies. That has now been cut off,\" Mr Verelst told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It seems that many Burundian troops are withdrawing, but it's not clear if all contingents will retreat,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yale Ford, an Africa Analyst for the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that Uvira, which had a population of about 700,000, was the DR Congo government's last major foothold and military hub in South Kivu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/what-m23s-capture-of-uvira-means-for-the-drc-wider-region-and-peace-talks-africa-file-special-edition\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the M23 was now likely to establish a parallel administration in the city</a>, and use its military gains \"as a bargaining chip in peace talks\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the DR Congo government, it has not acknowledged its latest military setback, but says that the \"gravity of the situation is compounded by the now proven risk of regional conflagration\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What does it mean for Burundi?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo for years because of its enmity with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both accuse the other of backing rebel groups seeking to overthrow their respective governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbours share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu, it would strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an apparent attempt to placate Burundi's fears, the M23 said it had \"no sights beyond our national borders\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our fight has the objective of peace, the protection of the population, the rebuilding of the state in DR Congo, as well as the stability of the Great Lakes region,\" the group added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has shut its border with DR Congo, but, according to Mr Verelst, it is still allowing people to cross into its territory after carrying out security checks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid agencies say that about 50,000 people have fled into Burundi in the past week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundian troops - along with the Congolese army and allied militias - fought to block the rebel advance towards Uvira, but the city itself fell \"without much fighting\", Mr Verelst said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Uvira would hit Burundi's already struggling economy as the country has been suffering from a severe shortage of foreign currency and fuel, and had been heavily dependent on eastern DR Congo for both, he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How did the M23 manage to capture Uvira?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 began a major advance earlier this year when it captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on the border with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, South African troops were deployed to help DR Congo's army, but they were forced to withdraw after the M23 seized the city in January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly afterwards the rebels captured the next big city in eastern DR Congo, Bukavu, capital of South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move on Uvira came after the rebels broke the defence lines of the DR Congo army, militias allied with it and Burundian troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the M23 was estimated to have more than 10,000 fighters, but there was likely to have been an \"influx\" of Rwandan troops for the recent offensive to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The reason why they are able to defeat their enemy is that the Rwandan army, at least, is very disciplined, and I think discipline matters more than manpower,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The conflict in recent days has also featured the extensive use of drone technology on both sides but the Rwandans have used this more to their advantage than the Congolese,\" he added.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Where does this leave the peace process?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears to be in deep trouble.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US lays the blame for the recent fighting squarely on Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Instead of progress toward peace, as we have seen under President Trump's leadership in recent weeks, Rwanda is leading the region toward more instability and toward war,\" Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, told a Security Council meeting on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier statement - issued by the US, European Union, and eight European governments - went further, saying that both the M23 and the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) should immediately halt \"offensive operations\", and Rwandan troops should withdraw from eastern DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the policy experts he had spoken to were \"baffled\" by the timing of the move to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was literally as they were signing a peace deal in Washington that Rwandan troops were amassing, and then invaded the area around Kamanyola, which is across the border from Rwanda, and then advanced on Uvira,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Leaders of Rwanda and DR of Congo sign peace deal alongside Donald Trump</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda's foreign ministry has not responded to the claims that its troops were in South Kivu, but said the ceasefire violations and fighting could not be \"attributed\" to Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It accused the DR Congo and Burundian armies of bombing villages near the Rwandan border, and said Burundi had \"amassed\" nearly 20,000 troops in South Kivu in support of DR Congo's army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it was now clear that DR Congo was \"never ready to commit to peace\", and even though Tshisekedi had attended the ceremony in Washington, it was \"as if he had been forced to sign\" the peace accord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DR Congo's government levelled a similar accusation against Kagame, saying he had made a \"deliberate choice\"  to abandon the Washington Accord, and to undermine Trump's efforts to end the conflict.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Can the deal be salvaged?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the US-led peace process was now on a \"troubled path, perhaps it is stuck\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that the success of the deal hinged on DR Congo's army launching an operation to disarm the FDLR militia group, members of which were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and which Kagame's government sees as a continued threat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, Prof Stearns said, he could not see DR Congo's army launching such an operation at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The peace deal also envisaged economic co-operation between DR Congo and Rwanda, including on hydro-electric power, mining and infrastructure development - something that the US hopes would pave the way for American companies to increase investments in the mineral-rich region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said he could not see this happening either while Rwandan troops remained in eastern DR Congo, and fighting continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that his understanding was that the parallel peace process in Doha - led by Qatar's government to broker a peace deal between the M23 and DR Congo's government - was also on hold at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's very difficult to imagine the Congolese returning there right now after there has been this major offensive by the M23,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Tshisekedi's options?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said that Tshisekedi was under \"very serious\" pressure from the public for his failure to keep his numerous promises to bring an end to the fighting in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Tshisekedi might also be under pressure from parts of the army, with whom he had a strained relationship after the arrest of generals for alleged corruption and because of the setbacks in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Tshisekedi was banking on the US to put pressure on Rwanda to withdraw its support for the M23.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be very difficult for the Congolese army to muster a response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's now in the hands of the various peace brokers, the US in particular, and perhaps Qatar and other donors,\" the academic said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's to be seen how much they care about ending this conflict, and how much political capital they are willing to spend.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about the DR Congo conflict:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

But one key detail stuck out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office A note from police search of Mr Mangione\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prosecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald's</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A fake name leads to an arrest</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald's</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpack</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office Dozens of $100 bills found during Mr Mangione's arrest\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Evidence found during Mr Mangione's arrest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hearing is expected to continue into next week.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin in a dark suit with a burgundy tie patterned with white dots shakes hands with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who wears a dark suit and an orange tie with white dots\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025.
