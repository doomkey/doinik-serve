rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which -

a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leader</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders.

The vice president visited soon after taking office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued control of the territory is critical for his planned missile defence system, Golden Dome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building,\" Trump said in a social media post early on Wednesday. \"NATO should be leading the way for us to get it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public opinion polls suggest a majority of Greenland residents oppose coming under US control. The island's representative to the US says the last time Greenlanders were asked if they wanted to be part of the US, in January 2025, only 6% were in favour of doing so, while 85% were against. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most Americans oppose US control of Greenland as well. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released Wednesday indicated that just 17% of Americans support the US seizing Greenland, compared to 47 percent who said they opposed Trump's push to acquire the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest talks on Greenland follow US military operations in Venezuela and against ISIS targets in Syria. Trump has also threatened to take military action to stop Iran's crackdown on a growing protest movement engulfing the nation.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

After the coup she was given jail sentences totalling 27 years on what are widely viewed as fabricated charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet despite her disappearance from public view, she still casts a long shadow over Myanmar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are repeated calls for her release, along with appeals to the generals to end their ruinous campaign against the armed opposition and negotiate an end to the civil war that has now dragged on for five years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military has tried to remove her once ubiquitous image, but you still see faded posters of \"The Lady\", or \"Amay Su\", Mother Su, as she is affectionately known, in tucked away corners. Could she still play a role in settling the conflict between the soldiers and the people of Myanmar?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, it has happened before. Back in 2010 the military had been in power for nearly 50 years, brutally crushed all opposition and run the economy into the ground. Just as it is doing now, it organised a general election which excluded Aung San Suu Kyi's popular National League for Democracy, and which it ensured its own proxy party, the USDP, would win.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As with <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7vly6gm76o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">this election, which is still under way in phases, </a>the one in 2010 was dismissed by most countries as a sham.

It was a more optimistic era; the generals could see their South East Asian neighbours prospering through trade with the Western world, and they wanted an end to crippling economic sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also sought better relations with the US as a counterbalance to their dependence on China, at a time when the Obama administration was making its celebrated \"pivot\" to Asia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The top generals were still hard-line and suspicious, but there was a group of less senior officers keen to explore a political compromise. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear what finally persuaded the military leadership to open the country up, but they clearly believed their 2008 constitution, which guaranteed the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in a future parliament, would be enough, with their well-funded party, to limit Aung San Suu Kyi's influence once she was released.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They badly underestimated her massive star power, and they underestimated how much their decades of misrule had alienated most of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 2015 election the USDP won just over 6% of the seats in both houses of parliament. In the next election in 2020 it expected to perform much better, after five years of an NLD administration which had started with impossibly high hopes, and had inevitably disappointed many of them. But the USDP fared even worse, winning just 5% of seats in the two houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even many of those who were dissatisfied with Aung San Suu Kyi's performance in government still chose hers over the military's party. This raised the possibility that she might eventually win enough support to change the constitution, and end the military's privileged position. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also ruled out the armed forces commander Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of becoming president after his retirement. He launched his coup on 1 February 2021, the day Aung San Suu Kyi was due to inaugurate her new government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time there are no reformers in the ranks, and no hopes of the kind of compromise which restored democracy back in 2010. The shocking violence used to put down protests against the coup has driven many young Burmese to take up arms against the junta. Tens of thousands have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. Attitudes on both sides have hardened.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar Commander In-Chief (L) and National League for Democracy (NLD) party leader Aung San Suu Kyi (R) shake hands after their meeting at the Commander in-Chief's office in Naypyidaw on December 2, 2015. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aung San Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing in December 2015, after her party won the first free election in decades</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 15 years Aung San Suu Kyi was detained after 1989, under conditions of house arrest in her lakeside family home in Yangon, were very different from the conditions she is being held in today. Her dignified, non-violent resistance won her admirers across Myanmar and around the world, and during the occasional spells of freedom the military gave her she was able to give rousing speeches from her front gate, or interviews to journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today she is invisible. Her long-held belief in non-violent struggle has been rejected by those who have joined the armed resistance, who argue that they must fight to end the military's role in Myanmar's political life. There is a lot more criticism of how Aung San Suu Kyi governed when she was in power than before. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her decision to lead Myanmar's defence against charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice over the military's atrocities against Muslim Rohingyas in 2017 badly tarnished her saint-like international image. It had much less resonance inside Myanmar, but many younger opposition activists are now willing to condemn how she handled the Rohingya crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the age of 80, with uncertain health, it is not clear how much influence she would have, were she to be released, even if she still wants to play a central role.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet her long struggle against military rule made her synonymous with all the hopes of a freer, more democratic future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is simply no-one else of her stature in Myanmar, and for that reason alone, many would argue, she is probably still needed if the country is to chart a path out of its current deadlock.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A huge, crashing sound,\" said school volunteer Pitchaya Promenade. \"I saw a blue crane sliding. It seemed stuck for a moment, and suddenly it flipped over.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The construction crane had collapsed onto a moving train, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqz7v1507ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">killing at least 32 people</a> and injuring 66 others.

Thailand's Public Health Ministry said there were still three people missing from the accident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rescuers were still pulling bodies out of the mangled train when the BBC arrived at the scene in the evening.

Another woman, whose right arm appeared to be broken, was holding onto her.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the train carriages had caught fire from the collision, which further complicated rescue efforts. Emergency responders used cranes and hydraulic cutting tools to free passengers trapped in the wreckage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People were screaming 'Help!

Singh has consistently maintained his innocence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He remains a member of parliament and secretary-general of the largest opposition party, Workers' Party (WP), but will lose privileges such as additional allowances and the right of first reply during parliamentary debates.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Singh's case stands out as one of the only criminal convictions against a sitting opposition lawmaker.

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the presidential race, Yoweri Museveni, 81, in power since 1986, is seeking a seventh successive victory as he faces a challenge from Bobi Wine, a charismatic pop star, aged 43.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where voting has been taking place, there are reports that the biometric machines used to verify voters' identities are still malfunctioning in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some biometric machines are not working. I don't know if it's the internet,\" a ruling party official told AFP news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Delays have also been caused by polling materials and equipment failing to arrive at some stations on time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Casting his vote in his native Rwakitura Village in the western Mbarara region, Museveni said he had also experienced difficulties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I put my thumbprint on the machine but it did not accept it. However, my face was accepted instantly by the machine.

Previously, Trump had criticised the Nobel committee for bypassing him and giving Machado the award.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Largely, he has appeared cool towards Machado, who was given the award in recognition of her long fight for democracy in Venezuela. In 2023, she won the opposition primary by a landslide, and was barred from running against Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election a year later was widely condemned as illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet after a US operation ousted Maduro earlier this month, Trump backed Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, saying Machado was \"not respected\" enough to lead the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, she will be hoping to use her face time with the US president to persuade him that his decision to back Rodríguez's interim government is a mistake, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0er4qd3115o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When BBC Mundo spoke to Machado after her most recent conversation with Trump – before the US intervened in Venezuela on 3 January – she told me that she thanked him for what he was doing \"for peace, freedom, and democracy\", insisting that together they would \"liberate\" Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But immediately after the US operation, Trump announced that he planned to \"run\" Venezuela himself and that he was content to keep Rodríguez's interim government in place, saying that she was \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump told reporters he had a \"great conversation\" with Rodríguez  and praised her as being a \"terrific person\" following a long phone call.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could a meeting between Machado and Trump in the Oval Office change all that?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is famously unpredictable in his personal relationships with other politicians, but how he sees Machado's role is likely to depend less on what she says than on what Rodríguez does in the coming weeks, and whether it meets Trump's approval.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many opposition supporters were shocked when Trump sidelined Machado in favour of Rodríguez, some are now beginning to understand what may have been behind that decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado is a polarising figure. Though loved by her supporters - who, among other things, admire her skill in uniting a previously fragmented opposition - she is hated by the regime and its loyalists for that very same reason. To them, she is a formidable and above all, outspoken opponent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the government now commands only minority popular support, according to polls and analysts, it retains firm control over the state's institutions, including the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Armed civilian groups known as colectivos, financed by the state, remain an integral part of the pro-government movement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this political and security climate, expressing public support for Machado, or for US intervention, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62077l3m7eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">is fraught with risk</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even some of Maduro's opponents fear what could happen if Trump was to install an opposition leader without holding fresh elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelans are divided on Trump's actions – even among those who opposed Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While some whisper support, others take particular issue with his statements suggesting that the US could control Venezuela and its oil.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"It seems unjust to me\" - Views on Maduro's seizure from Caracas</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The division over who should lead the country is deeper still.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Venezuelans admire Machado and recognise her as the only opposition leader who maintained a coherent and consistent challenge to Maduro's government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here in Caracas, some people have told the BBC that, contrary to Trump's claim, she enjoys strong support within the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They point to her landslide victory in the opposition primary ahead of the 2024 presidential election and her ability to mobilise thousands of Venezuelans to protest when Maduro declared victory in the election, even though independently verified tallies showed the candidate backed by Machado had won.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That group views Rodríguez as one of the architects of Maduro's government and its abuses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They will want Machado to press Trump at the White House on how the US plans to \"run\" Venezuela and to try and convince him that, while his promise to \"Make Venezuela Great Again\" by controlling the country's oil industry may appeal to some US Maga supporters, it does little to restore democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others, however, agree with Trump and believe Rodríguez should oversee the transition. They view her as the best option to avoid the instability that could be triggered by a backlash from supporters of the current government and the colectivos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They would not welcome the opposition taking power after a US military operation in which Maduro was captured and sent to New York to face drug trafficking and arms charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army and the colectivos are currently unlikely to take orders from the opposition and, at least in the short term, some feel the status quo is safer.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2700/live/545e6530-f19c-11f0-902c-95f53da9a46e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Delcy Rodríguez wears a green dress and places her left hand on a red velvet covered book as she raises her right hand and is sworn in as interim president \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Delcy Rodríguez, centre, has received Trump's blessing to lead the country after Maduro was seized</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A prominent Venezuelan political analyst – who did not want to be named – told the BBC that many people believe Trump's ability to overthrow Maduro was made possible largely because of Machado's efforts to weaken the regime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Personally, I doubt that Trump fully believes what he said.

But one relationship has sharply deteriorated - Somalia's long-standing partnership with the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the oil-rich Gulf state has been viewed as a significant player in Somalia's security, economy, and politics, as the country has a coastline of more than 3,000km (1,864 miles) along the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean - a strategic maritime region hit by piracy and weapon-smuggling that has contributed to instability in both Africa and the Middle East.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UAE cultivated multi-layered relationships with both Somalia's federal government and its regions, and has been involved in port operations in Bosaso in Puntland and Kismayo in Jubaland, as well as Berbera in Somaliland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Monday, Somalia's federal government announced the cancellation of all port management and security cooperation agreements with the UAE, accusing it of undermining the country's sovereignty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We had a good relationship with the UAE, but unfortunately, they didn't engage us as an independent and sovereign nation. After a careful assessment, we were forced to take the decision that we took,\" Somalia's President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said in a televised address following an extraordinary cabinet meeting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UAE has not yet responded to his comments. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Omar Mahmoud, a senior researcher at the International Crisis Group think-tank, tells the BBC that Israel's recognition of Somaliland formed the backdrop to the decision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Somalia views this as an infringement of its territorial integrity and believes the UAE played a behind-the-scenes role in supporting the outcome,\" Mahmoud says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late December, Israel became the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence. This led to huge celebrations in Somaliland's capital, Hargeisa, as Israel had given the territory the recognition it had yearned for since it seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, forming its own government, and adopting its own passport and currency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In exchange, Somaliland said it would sign up to the 2020 Abraham Accords, which have so far seen the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco establish full diplomatic relations with Israel, giving Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government a boost at a time it has faced a backlash over the war in Gaza. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The region is increasingly defined by divergent geopolitical blocs, with the UAE and Israel on one side, and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and others on the other,\" Mahmoud says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, The Middle East Eye news site reported that the diplomatic fall-out has led to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-removing-its-military-bosaso-after-angry-somalia-ends-agreement\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">UAE evacuating its security personnel and heavy military equipment from the air base in Bosaso</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmoud says that Somalia's relationship with the UAE has been steadily deteriorating since 2024, when Ethiopia - a major ally of the Gulf state in the Horn of Africa - signalled that it was prepared to recognise Somaliland's independence, in a trade-off that would see it establish a navel base along the breakaway state's coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Somali suspicion of the UAE grew following Ethiopia's 2024 memorandum of understanding with Somaliland to swap sea access for recognition, as Somalia saw the UAE as potentially supporting an agreement it strongly opposed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But Ethiopia only promised recognition. Israel went ahead and did it, and that raises the stakes,\" Mahmoud adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The analyst points out that Somalia has also accused the UAE of using its territory to help Yemeni separatist leader Aidarous al-Zubaidi leave the country, and this was likely to have been \"the final straw\" that led to the rupture in their relationship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Using Somalia's airspace, Somalia's airfields to smuggle a fugitive is not something that Somalia condones,\" Ali Omar, Somalia's state minister for foreign affairs, told Al Jazeera. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y2mvp3r2do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Last week, the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen made a similar accusation</a>, alleging that al-Zubaidi, who heads Yemen's separatist Southern Transitional Council, first crossed into Berbera by ship, and was then flown by a cargo aircraft to Abu Dhabi via Mogadishu under the \"supervision\" of UAE officers. The UAE denies backing the separatists in Yemen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the first time diplomatic relations between Somalia and the UAE have soured. In 2018, Somalia, then under President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo, severed ties with the UAE, accusing it of interference in Somalia's internal affairs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, the current president was an opposition figure who strongly defended the UAE's involvement in Somalia, but he has now adopted a sharply different position, trying to exploit differences between the UAE and Saudi Arabia over the war in Yemen to his advantage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Regional developments including Israel's recognition of Somaliland and shifting dynamics in Yemen involving Saudi Arabia and the Southern Transitional Council created sufficient pressure for the government to act decisively,\" Samira Gaid, an analyst with Balqiis Insight think-tank, tells the BBC. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Mahmoud says Somalia's federal government lacks the capacity to enforce its decision to cancel port deals with the UAE, as it does not exercise authority over the breakaway state of Somaliland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor does it have much control over the ports in Puntland and Jubaland, two semi-autonomous regions within Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Somali government has little presence on the ground in these areas and is locked into political competition with these administrations over the division of power within Somalia's federal system,\" Mahmoud says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Dubai-based logistics company, DP World, appears to be unperturbed by the federal government's announcement, saying its operations at Berbera port in Somaliland will continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"DP World remains focused on the safe, efficient operation of the port and on delivering trade facilitation and economic benefits for Somaliland and the wider Horn of Africa region,\" it said in a statement to Reuters, adding that questions about \"political decisions, intergovernmental discussions, or diplomatic positions should be directed to the relevant authorities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its statement came as no surprise as Somaliland said that all its agreements with the UAE \"remain lawful and binding\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Jubaland, it said it regarded the federal government decision as \"null and void\", while Puntland condemned it as being \"inconsistent with the principles of constitutional governance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Mahmoud says that Somalia still has some leverage over the UAE, and its allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mogadishu controls the country's airspace and can use that, alongside diplomatic pressure, to push both the UAE and the regional administrations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Somalia is also likely to rally partners such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in support of its position,\" he adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmoud does not see relations between Somalia and the UAE improving in the foreseeable future, as \"trust has been lost\".</p><p
