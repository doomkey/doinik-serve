You don't defend leases.\" </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Swedish Deputy PM: EU and US relationship \"has been damaged\" by Greenland pursuit</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato spokeswoman Allison Hart said in a statement after the meeting between Trump and Rutte: \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament questioned why Nato would have any input on the island's mineral wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nato in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us,\" Aaja Chenmitz said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to US media, the potential plan could allow the US to build more military bases on the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials who attended the Nato meeting on Wednesday told the New York Times a template for the suggested arrangement might be similar to UK bases on Cyprus, which are part of British Overseas Territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland. It already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in the north-western tip of the territory.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump takes aim at world leaders in Davos speech</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had been threatening to place a 10% tariff \"on any and all goods\" sent from the UK to the US from 1 February, increasing to 25% from 1 June, until a deal was reached for Washington to purchase Greenland from Denmark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same would have applied to goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland – all of which are members of Nato, the defence alliance founded in 1949. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the US president abandoned talk of a trade war after meeting Rutte. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,\" Trump said in his post on Truth Social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first speech in six years to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Trump said he was \"seeking immediate negotiations\" to acquire Greenland, but insisted the US would not take the territory by force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive force. We'd be unstoppable, but we won't do that,\" Trump said. \"I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also urged world leaders to allow the US to take control of Greenland from Denmark, saying: \"You can say yes and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his own speech at Davos a day earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron criticised Trump's previous threat of import taxes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said an \"endless accumulation of new tariffs\" from the US was \"fundamentally unacceptable\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Macron was among those urging the EU to consider retaliatory options against new US levies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his speech, Trump took aim at Macron, saying France had been \"screwing\" the US for decades. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president also took a swipe at Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who urged \"middle powers\" such as Australia, Argentina and his own country to band together when he spoke at Davos a day earlier.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, the US president accused Carney of being ungrateful to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said. \"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was \"left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold \"until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move renewed the possibility that the EU might move forward with tariffs on a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods it announced last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It had put those plans on hold while the trade deal was being finalised but those levies would now come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves to extend the pause or approves the new deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lange, speaking before Trump announced the \"framework deal\" and backed off the tariff threat,  said there would be \"no possibility for compromise\" until Trump's threats ended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also raised the prospect of the use of the \"anti-coercion instrument\" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\", an idea also backed by French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC after Trump's announcement, Lange declined to say whether it could salvage the trade deal, adding that it would take \"some time\" to understand its implications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to look what this so-called solution would mean,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There seems to be a sense in Brussels that Trump's climbdown was inevitable. When BBC News asked one well placed EU source for a response to President Trump saying he wouldn't go ahead with the tariffs, the response was simply an eye-rolling emoji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the last year, financial markets have batted away concerns over the impact of the US president's policy announcements, taking comfort in the TACO acronym, Trump Always Chickens Out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the sense of him not following through on threats has also taken hold in some corridors of power.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He called for \"immediate negotiations\" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security, announcing the \"framework\" of a future deal a few hours later.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's speech helped to calm financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, which had sunk in previous days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in the US gained further on the deal announcement, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising more than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the FTSE 100 closed slightly higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjnlm54po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal</a> amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said European leaders should not jump to retaliate, urging them to \"have an open mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Instead, creativity was innate to our species, the evidence for which stretches back to Africa, where we evolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I went to university in the mid to late 90s, that's what we were taught – the creative explosion in humans occurred in a small part of Europe. But now we're seeing traits of modern human behaviour, including narrative art in Indonesia, which makes that Eurocentric argument very hard to sustain\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oldest Spanish cave art is a red hand stencil in Maltravieso cave in Western Spain, dated to be at least 66,700 years old - though this is controversial and some experts don't think it to be that old. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2014, hand stencils and animal figures dating back at least 40,000 years were found in Sulawesi, followed by a hunting scene that is at least 44,000 year old, and then a narrative pig and human painting dated to at least 51,200 years ago. Each step pushed sophisticated image making further back in time, according to Professor Maxime Aubert of Griffiths University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We started with minimum ages of at least 40,000 years, the same time as in Europe, but by getting closer to the pigment we've pushed the rock art in Sulawesi back by at least another 28,000 years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest discovery is from a limestone cave called Liang Metanduno on Muna, a small island off south eastern Sulawesi. It has been spray-painted: an ancient graffiti artist pressed their hand flat against the cave wall, then blew or spat a mouthful of pigment around it so that, when they pulled the hand away, a negative outline was left behind on the rock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fragmentary hand stencil there is overlain by thin mineral crusts that, when analysed, was found to have a minimum age of 67,800 years, making it the oldest reliably dated cave art anywhere in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, the artist did more than simply spray pigment around a hand pressed to the wall, the researchers say.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/906e/live/a8723280-f5fe-11f0-842b-5772902eef21.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Ahdi Agus Oktaviana A close view of a cave wall shows four reddish handprints in a rough rectangle, like a tiny gallery of ghostly signatures. Each is a negative hand stencil: the artist pressed a hand to the rock and sprayed red pigment around it, leaving the hand itself as bare stone outlined in colour. The rock surface is uneven and mottled green, cream and brown, with cracks and small cavities. Three stencils are clear, with long, unnaturally narrow fingers that taper to points, while the fourth, at the top right, is partly flaked away so only fragments of the palm and fingers remain. The overall effect is of glowing red halos of paint framing pale hands that seem to reach out from the ancient rock\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Ahdi Agus Oktaviana</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">More recent elongated hand stencils found elsewhere in Suluwesi shows how prevalent the red claw image was among these ancient artists.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the original stencil was made, the outlines of the fingers were carefully altered – narrowed and elongated to make it look more claw-like; a creative transformation that Brumm argues is \"a very us thing to do\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He notes that there was no evidence of that experimentation in any of the art produced by our sister species, Neanderthals, in their cave paintings in Spain around 64,000 years ago. Even that is hotly contested because some researchers question the dating method.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until this latest discovery on Muna, all the paintings in Sulawesi had come from the Maros Pangkep karst in the island's south west. The fact that this much older stencil turns up on the opposite side of Sulawesi, on a separate satellite island, suggests that making images on cave walls was not a local experiment but deeply embedded in the cultures that spread across the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brumm says years of fieldwork by Indonesian colleagues have revealed \"hundreds of new rock art sites\" across remote areas, with some caves used repeatedly over tens of thousands of years. At Liang Metanduno, other, much younger paintings on the same panel – some produced as late as about 20,000 years ago – show that this single cave was a focus for artistic activity stretching over at least 35,000 years.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because Sulawesi lies on the northern sea route between mainland Asia and ancient Sahul, the dates have direct implications for assessing when the ancestors of Aboriginal Australians first arrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the mainstream view – based largely on DNA studies and most archaeological sites – was that Homo sapiens first reached the ancient Australia–New Guinea landmass, Sahul, about 50,000 years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But with firm evidence that Homo sapiens were settled on Sulawesi and making complex symbolic art at least 67,800 years ago, it makes it much more likely that controversial archaeological evidence for humans in northern Australia by about 65,000 years is correct, according to Adhi Agus Oktaviana, of the Indonesia's national research and innovation Agency (BRIN).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very likely that the people who made these paintings in Sulawesi were part of the broader population that would later spread through the region and ultimately reach Australia.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many archaeologists once argued for a European \"big bang\" of the mind because cave paintings, carvings, ornaments and new stone tools all seem to appear together in France and Spain about 40,000 years ago, soon after Homo sapiens arrived there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Spectacular Ice Age cave art in places like Altamira and El Castillo encouraged the idea that symbolism and art switched on almost overnight in Ice Age Europe. Since then, engraved ochre, beads and abstract marks from South African sites such as Blombos Cave, some 70,000–100,000 years old, have shown that symbolic behaviour was already established in Africa long before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with very old figurative and narrative paintings from Sulawesi, a new consensus is being shaped; that there was a much deeper and more widespread story of creativity, Aubert told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What it suggests is that humans would have had that capacity for a very long time, at least when they left Africa – but probably before that\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The White House has denied that Trump is considering granting her clemency, however, Trump has also said he has not ruled it out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, the Department of Justice faced a deadline of 19 December last year to release all remaining Epstein files in its possession. So far only a fraction of them have been made public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The department has faced criticism from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the number of redactions in the files, which the law permits only to protect victims' identities and active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee voted to hold former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxxw0wx44o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in contempt of Congress over their refusal to comply with subpoenas</a> in its Epstein investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee had summoned both Clintons to testify about Epstein, with whom Bill Clinton has appeared in photographs in the 1990s and early 2000s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bill Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for the Clintons had called the Oversight Committee subpoenas \"unenforceable\", and said they had already provided the \"limited information\" they had about Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee approved the measure with the support of several Democrats.

Banks typically offer lower interest rates for primary homes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has asked the court to allow the president to remove Cook, a move lower courts had blocked while the case played out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if it's inadvertent or a mistake, it's quite a big mistake,\" said solicitor general D John Sauer, who was arguing the case for the administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said such conduct could undermine confidence in the bank and that courts were bound to defer to the president's judgement when it comes to finding a cause. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He dismissed questions about process, noting that Trump had alerted Cook to the issue on social media before formally firing her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was a social media post,\" he said. \"And the response was defiance.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Nothing criminal whatsoever'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cook has denied committing fraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a November letter to the Justice Department, her lawyers said the claims were based on \"cherry-picked, incomplete snippets of the full documents\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said there was \"one stray reference to primary residence\" in a mortgage application for an apartment in Alabama, but noted that the file also contained \"truthful and more specific disclosures about the property's use\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no fraud, no intent to deceive, nothing whatsoever criminal or remotely a basis to allege mortgage fraud,\" her lawyers wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arguing on behalf of Cook, Paul Clement said people in her position should have the chance to present their evidence and be shielded from having a decision made in advance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the administration's interpretation of the law would make the protection that Congress intended by inserting the \"for cause\" requirement \"toothless\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some justices indicated that they shared those concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause that the president alone determines - that would weaken if not shatter the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" Kavanaugh said. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit is seen as high stakes, given swirling debate about Trump's efforts to influence the Fed, which he wants to lower interest rates more aggressively to boost economic growth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was among the officials expected to attend. He is facing his own criminal probe related to cost overruns during renovations of Fed properties - concerns he has called \"pretexts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other recent cases, the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has allowed the White House to proceed with firings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it has signalled that it views the Federal Reserve, which was designed to set policy independently from the White House, as different.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement after the hearing, Cook's lawyers said they were \"hopeful\" the court would recognise the importance of the Fed being able to operate free from political interference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her own statement, Cook, who attended the hearing, said: \"This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For as long as I serve at the Federal Reserve, I will uphold the principle of political independence in service to the American people.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several justices, including conservatives, indicated they were hesitant to greenlight Cook's removal without courts having resolved issues like whether the mortgage filings, which were made before Cook was appointed, would meet the bar for a \"for cause\" firing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know that the independence of the agency is very important and that that independence is harmed if we decide these issues too quickly and without due consideration,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal. \"So to me, waiting to have at least the lower courts look at these issues first makes the most sense.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody... in such a hurried manner?\" asked Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another Trump appointee, pressed Sauer to explain what harm the president would suffer by waiting, noting that the court had been warned of potentially dire economic consequences of a decision that could weaken belief in the central bank's independence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a risk,\" she said. \"Doesn't that counsel... caution on our part?\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But in 2011 all 54 of Japan's reactors had to be shut after the most powerful earthquake it had ever recorded triggered a meltdown at Fukushima, causing one of the worst nuclear disasters in history.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the latest installment in Japan's nuclear power reboot, which still has a long way to go.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be brought back on until 2030, and the other five could be decommissioned. That leaves the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational: 8.2 gigawatts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi, 220km (135 miles) north-east of Tokyo on the coast, led to radioactive leakage. Local communities were evacuated, and many have not returned despite official assurances that it was safe to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics say the plant's owner Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, was not prepared, and the response from them and government was not well co-ordinated.

The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant is the first of those owned by Tepco to be turned back on. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before 2011, nuclear power accounted for nearly 30% of Japan's electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030. Its energy plan last year unveiled a tamer goal: it wants nuclear power to provide 20% of its electricity needs by 2040.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even that may be tricky.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'A drop on a hot stone'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global momentum is building around nuclear energy, with the International Atomic Energy Agency estimating that the world's nuclear power capacity could more than double by 2050. In Japan, as of 2023, nuclear power accounted for just 8.5% of electricity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office in October, has emphasised the importance of nuclear power for Japan's energy self-sufficiency. Especially as it expects energy demand to surge because of data centres and semiconductor manufacturing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan's leaders and its energy companies have long pushed for nuclear power. They say it's more reliable than renewable energy like solar and wind, and better suited for Japan's mountainous terrain. But critics say the emphasis on nuclear energy has come at the cost of investing in renewables and cutting emissions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, as Japan tries to revive its nuclear power ambitions, the costs of running the reactors have surged, partly because of new safety checks that require hefty investments from companies trying to restart plants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nuclear power is getting much more expensive than they ever thought it would,\" says Dr Florentine Koppenborg, a senior researcher at the Technical University of Munich.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government could subsidise the costs, or pass them on to consumers - both unpalatable options for Japan's leaders, who have for decades been hailing the affordability of nuclear power. An expensive energy bill could also hurt the government at a time when households are protesting about rising costs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's \"hands are tied when it comes to financially supporting nuclear power, unless it's willing to go back on one of the main selling points\", Koppenborg says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think [Japan's nuclear power revival] is a drop on a hot stone, because it does not change the larger picture of nuclear power decline in Japan.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8aad/live/33ae3eb0-f696-11f0-a096-99c1f7341c2b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Backview of a man walking through a nuclear power plant\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Only one of the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant are coming back on for now  </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beyond the fear of another disaster like Fuksuhima, a series of scandals has also rattled public trust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in particular found itself embroiled in a couple of them. In 2023, one of its employees lost a stack of documents after placing it on top of their car and forgetting it was there before driving away. In November, another was found to have mishandled confidential documents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Tepco spokesperson said the company reported the incidents to the Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA), adding that it aimed to continue improving security management.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These revelations are \"a good sign\" for transparency, says Koppenborg. But they also reveal that \"Tepco is struggling to change its ways [and] the way it approaches safety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, the NRA suspended its review to restart nuclear reactors at Chubu Electric's Hamaoka plant in central Japan, after the company was found to have manipulated quake data in its tests. The company apologised, saying: \"We will continue to respond sincerely, and to the fullest extent possible, to the instructions and guidance of the NRA.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hisanori Nei, a former senior nuclear safety official, tells the BBC, while he was \"surprised\" by the scandal at Hamaoka, he believed the harsh penalty handed to its operator should deter other companies from doing the same.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Power companies should recognise the importance not to [falsify data],\" he said, adding that authorities will \"reject and punish\" offending companies.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Surviving another Fukushima</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What happened at Fukushima turned Japanese public opinion against what had been hailed as an affordable and sustainable form of energy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of residents filed class action lawsuits against Tepco and the Japanese government, demanding compensation for property damage, emotional distress and health problems allegedly linked to radiation exposure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the weeks after the March 2011 disaster, 44% of Japanese thought the use of nuclear power should be reduced, according to a survey by Pew Research Center.

But then polls by the Japanese business publication Nikkei in 2022 showed that more than 50% of people supported nuclear power if safety was ensured. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6ec6/live/74b7f8b0-f691-11f0-a432-8bc82bc19146.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman in a face mask holding an anti-nuclear power sign.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Many remain opposed to Japan's nuclear power revival</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is still fear and mistrust.

His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March last year, a Tokyo court <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge1lr7225yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">revoked the church's status</a> as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Baldoni strongly denies the claims and is defending the lawsuit, which named him and his production company, Wayfarer studios, which was behind It Ends With Us. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Text messages from 2023 between Lively and people close to her appear to show that Lively called Baldoni a \"rabid pig\", while her friend Taylor Swift suggested Baldoni knew the lawsuit was coming \"because he's gotten out his tiny violin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baldoni's $400m (£295m) counter-suit was dismissed by a judge last June. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lively's case is set to go to trial in May.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The newly unsealed documents show both Lively and Baldoni venting to friends and colleagues about filming It Ends With Us, and the subsequent press tour, ahead of the film's release in August 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the messages, Lively referred to Baldoni as \"this doofus director of my movie\" and described him as \"a clown\" who \"thinks he's a writer now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their filing earlier this week, Lively's team did not deny the language she had used but said the text messages were missing context.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They referred the court to the \"complete\" text exchange, including subsequent messages from Lively to Baldoni which said \"we all benefit\" from her relationship with Swift and her husband Ryan Reynolds, and \"you will too, I can promise you\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sigrid McCawley, a member of Lively's legal team, said in a statement to the BBC the newly unsealed evidence \"shows the concerns of Ms. Lively and others were documented in real-time as early as Spring 2023, and Wayfarer understood them as \"sexual harassment\" concerns.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">McCawley's statement continued, \"The evidence also documents how Wayfarer refused to investigate, but instead attempted to \"bury\" Ms. Lively and others who spoke up through retaliation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baldoni's legal team has not responded to the BBC's request for comment, but Bryan Feldman, a lawyer for Baldoni and Wayfarer, told CNN, \"the evidence does not support the claims as a matter of law. A simple read of the newly released message exchanges make the truth abundantly clear. We remain confident in the legal process and clearing the names of all of the Justin Baldoni parties.\" </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Text messages between Lively and singer Taylor Swift (pictured) appear to be among the unsealed documents</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The messages also show Lively saying of Baldoni: \"Despite his repeated disturbing behaviour and acts, I still feel bad for him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To be reminded multiple times daily that he's smearing me for... asking him not to sexually or emotionally harass me? For making his movie better? For calling in all the favours to turn out all the biggest musicians and entertainers to contribute to making his movie better? For leading a marketing campaign for free?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued: \"I literally don't know a single thing I've done that he can smear me about. Ryan [Reynolds] says [Baldoni] should be writing me apology and thank you letters every day. And instead he chooses to make a monster outta me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But what's my crime. I've only ever stayed focused on the work and given him every opportunity to make it better. And he just keeps behaving like a rabid pig.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The messages also appear to show Lively texted Baldoni's former The Man Enough Podcast co-host, Liz Plank in May 2023, and told her that \"today I came home and cried\" following an \"SOS set visit\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plank responded by saying that she \"thought maybe things had gotten better\", and that it was \"astounding they have gotten away with so much\". It is unclear who \"they\" refers to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents note that Plank recalled working on Baldoni's set as \"truly one of the worst days of [her] life\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later that year, Lively also sent texts to actress and co-star Jenny Slate, and said she was \"dreading\" going back to set and \"getting hits of the experience in really upsetting ways\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her deposition, Slate also alleged misconduct on the set of the film, with court documents revealing that she had made complaints against Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath during the course of filming It Ends With Us.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Heath is the CEO of Wayfarer Studios.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similarly, texts sent by Baldoni also suggest friction between him and Lively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In February 2024, Baldoni told Heath that he was concerned that Lively would use the allegations she had made against him as leverage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wrote: \"She had the nuclear bomb. If she doesn't promote the movie she can leak that I'm a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and 'all the stuff' she has on me. Then she's the victim.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her legal filing accuses Baldoni and Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\", in addition to a hostile working environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The text messages were unsealed on Tuesday before a summary judgement hearing in Lively's ongoing lawsuit that is scheduled for 22 January.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

the BBC and the Global Anti-Scam Organisation (Gaso), a volunteer-run group that helps rescue and support trafficked victims. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a video diary recorded inside his

He later took shelter in a safe house in Phnom Penh, before eventually returning to China. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three years after the documentary was broadcast, he is now working in a factory in southern China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigation also featured testimony from another Chinese man, Mi Lijun, who said he became seriously ill while being held at the compound.

She said he had an infection that was worsening without giving further details.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Byanyima described how she had found him \"huddled\" on a dirty plastic chair in a small room near his cell, where he has been returned after getting medical treatment overnight. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besigye, who has run for president against Museveni four times, has been in detention with his associate Obeid Lutale since they were both dramatically seized in Kenya and taken back to Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The PFF leader has been charged in a military court with treason, which carries the death sentence, as well as illegal possession of a firearm and threatening national security. He denies the accusations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, a court denied them bail for the fourth time, saying it was too early to release them as they had not yet entered their pleas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Tuesday, the PFF accused Ugandan authorities of denying Besigye proper medical care, noting that his continued detention amounted to a violation of his basic rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a tragedy that a man who has dedicated his life to the health and freedom of others is being denied his own right to medical dignity,\" the PFF said, adding: \"We hold the regime and the prison authorities fully accountable for his well-being.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prison service spokesperson, denied that Besigye's health was critical, saying the opposition figure was under standard medical supervision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Kizza Besigye receives necessary treatment like other prisoners and he is fine,\" Baine said, adding: \"This morning he was doing his exercises.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Byanyima described this statement as \"a cover-up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">''Last night, after a sharp deterioration in his condition, he was rushed to the clinic of his personal doctor, where he was treated and then returned to prison late at night,'' she said, calling on the authorities to transfer him to a fully equipped hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another opposition leader, Bobi Wine, has expressed concern over Besigye's health while in detention, saying his condition appears to be deteriorating amid limited access to medical care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We stand fully in solidarity with him and pray for his recovery,\" Wine said in a post on X. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the first time the veteran opposition leader has been taken ill at Luzira Prison, a maximum security jail in Kampala, where he has been held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last February, Besigye <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgeg6rz8xvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was also reported critically ill after he went on hunger strike demanding justice</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besigye, who last contested the presidency in 2016, has previously accused the authorities of political persecution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the general election earlier this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have been increasing calls by his family, opposition and human rights groups for him to be released on medical grounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Museveni has blamed Besigye and his legal team for the delays in the trial, which he said had resulted in the PFF's leader's continued detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni, who has held power since 1986, was on Saturday declared the winner of last week's presidential election with 72% of the vote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His closest challenger Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, got 25%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wine rejected the results as \"fake\" and has gone into hiding citing threats against his life. </p></div></div></body></html>"

However, an interim report published in July sparked widespread speculation and controversy. Boeing declined to comment.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The aircraft involved in the accident, registered as VT-ANB, was one of the earliest 787s to be built. It first flew in late 2013, and entered service with Air India in early 2014.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foundation for Aviation Safety says documents show that the plane experienced system failures from its very first day in service for Air India. It alleges these were caused by \"a wide and confusing variety of engineering, manufacturing, quality, and maintenance problems\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The failures included electronics and software faults, circuit breakers tripping repeatedly, damage to wiring, short circuits, loss of electrical current, and overheating of power system components.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January 2022, it says, there was a fire in the P100 power distribution panel. This is one of five such panels that take high-voltage power generated by the engines and distribute it around the aircraft. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pilots started receiving fault messages during a descent into Frankfurt Airport - and the damage was discovered afterwards. It<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></i>was so severe, the FAS says, that the entire panel had to be replaced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 787 relies more heavily on electrical systems than previous generations of passenger aircraft. In an attempt to improve efficiency, its designers got rid of numerous mechanical and pneumatic components, and replaced them with electrical ones, which were lighter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, this led to problems early in the aircraft's existence, including <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20942484\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a major battery fire</a> on a plane owned by Japan Airlines in 2013, which led to a temporary grounding of the 787 fleet. The P100 panel itself <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-11-24-Boeing-Initiates-Changes-to-787-Power-Panel-Updates-to-Software\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">was redesigned</a> in 2010 following a fire on board a test aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foundation's report has been sent to the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which last year held hearings into \"Boeing's broken safety culture\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The official investigation into the Ahmedabad crash is being carried out by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB). American officials have also been taking part, as the aircraft and its engines were designed and built in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A month after the accident, the AAIB <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aaib.gov.in/What's%20New%20Assets/Preliminary%20Report%20VT-ANB.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">published a preliminary report.</a> This is standard practice in accident investigations, and is meant to provide a summary of the known facts at the time of publication. It will not usually draw firm conclusions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a short section of this 15-page report generated significant controversy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It states that moments after take-off, the plane's fuel control switches, which are normally used when starting the engines before a flight and shutting them down afterwards, had been moved from the \"run\" to the \"cut-off\" position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This would have deprived the engines of fuel, causing them to lose thrust rapidly. The switches were moved back to restart the engines, but too late to prevent the disaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report then says: \"In the cockpit voice recording, one of the pilots is heard asking the other why did he cut-off. The other pilot responded that he did not do so.\" The actual transcript is not provided.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That indirectly reported conversation prompted a number of commentators in the US and India to suggest that the accident had been caused by one of the pilots, either deliberately or inadvertently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has since been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33pzypkkdzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a backlash</a> from lawyers for the accident victims, safety campaigners, a pilots' association and some technical experts in India and the US. They believe the focus on the pilots is misleading, and has diverted attention away from the possibility of a technical problem with the aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the report was issued, the BBC has spoken to a range of people within the industry, including pilots, accident investigators and engineers. While theories about what actually happened vary widely, there is a broad acknowledgement that important information is missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foundation for Aviation Safety is an organisation led by Ed Pierson, a former senior manager at Boeing's Renton factory in Seattle, who has been an outspoken critic of the aerospace giant's safety and quality control standards for years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has previously described the preliminary report into the Air India crash as \"woefully inadequate… embarrassingly inadequate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foundation says its concerns about the 787 go beyond the aircraft involved in that accident. It says it has also examined some 2,000 reports of failures on hundreds of other aircraft in the US, Canada and Australia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include water leaks into wiring bays, which have previously been noted by US regulator the Federal Aviation Administration. Concerns about the aircraft have also been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyq7vgq2e5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">voiced in some other quarters</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boeing has always maintained that the 787 is a safe aircraft with a strong record. Prior to the Ahmedabad crash, it had operated for nearly a decade and a half without a single fatality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has not seen the documents referred to in the Foundation's report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boeing declined to comment, as the investigation into the Air India crash is still ongoing. It referred queries about the crash to the AAIB.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Air India and the AAIB have been approached for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Both are known to court media attention with strong language and provocative statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Leary said at the press conference that his team is going to X's office in Dublin to give Musk a free Ryanair ticket to thank him for the \"wonderful boost\" in publicity he's had.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to call me an idiot, he wouldn't be the first, and he certainly won't be the last ... But if it helps to boost Ryanair sales, you could insult me all day, every day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The squabble between the two intensified after O'Leary called Musk an \"idiot\" and said using Starlink to provide Ryanair passengers with free wifi would not be cost-effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Leary added that the cost of installing Starlink would be €250m (£218m) to fit all necessary equipment — and would increase fuel costs by €100m (£87m) per year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he thinks only 5% of Ryanair passengers would pay for wifi, so there would be poor return on investment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the prospect of Musk buying the Irish airline, O'Leary said: \"We're a publicly owned company. He's free to [buy shares] at any time, but non-European citizens cannot own a majority of European airlines.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to invest in Ryanair, we would think it's a very good investment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Leary called all social media \"a cesspit\", but conceded it was important for Ryanair's marketing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company is known to take an irreverent approach to social media, often mocking customers for complaining about the airline's cost-cutting measures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">O'Leary said he'd had no direct contact with Elon Musk.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk has floated the idea of buying Ryanair several times on X in the past week, but EU-based airlines must be majority owned by people from the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, after German airline Lufthansa announced it would install Starlink on its planes to provide all passengers with free wi-fi, O'Leary said Musk knew \"zero\" about flight aerodynamics.</p></div></div></body></html>"

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria's government has announced a new ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), after the militia alliance withdrew from a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF said its forces were \"compelled\" to leave al-Hol camp and redeploy to other cities in north-east Syria \"due to the international indifference toward the issue of [IS]\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria's interior ministry complained that it took place without co-ordination with the government or US-led coalition against IS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the presidency said it had reached an \"understanding\" with the SDF on the future of Hassakeh province, which has a large Kurdish population.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A statement said the SDF would be given four days to carry out consultations on a detailed plan for the peaceful integration of areas under its control into the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The presidency also promised that government forces would not enter the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli, or any Kurdish villages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, the SDF declared its \"full commitment to the ceasefire\" and said its forces would not initiate any military action unless they were attacked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF also said it was ready to \"move forward with implementing\" the deal reached with the government on Sunday that was supposed to end almost two weeks of fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agreement should see the Kurdish-run autonomous region in the country's north-east and its key infrastructure brought under government control, as well as the integration of the tens of thousands of SDF fighters into the defence and interior ministries' forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It represents a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy that it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led coalition forces defeat IS militarily during the country's 13-year civil war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains deeply divided and has been rocked by waves of deadly sectarian violence.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF announced its withdrawal from al-Hol camp as Syrian army and interior ministry forces advanced deep into Hassakeh province after taking control of Deir al-Zour and Raqqa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Due to the international indifference toward the issue of the IS terrorist organisation and the failure of the international community to assume its responsibilities in addressing this serious matter, our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hol camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to Kurdish news agency Hawar, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi urged the US-led coalition - once his main ally - to \"bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We withdrew to predominantly Kurdish areas and protecting them is a red line,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Syrian interior ministry said the SDF units had pulled out of al-Hol without any co-ordination in an \"attempt to pressure the government over the fight against terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ministry added that it was \"taking all necessary measures in co-ordination and co-operation with the international coalition to maintain security and stability\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defence ministry also said it was ready to assume control of the camp as well as all prisons holding suspected IS fighters in the

the SDF was holding about 8,000 suspected IS fighters at prisons in north-eastern Syria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 34,000 people linked to IS were also being detained at al-Hol and another camp, Roj, the UN reported last August.

Search operations by the security forces resulted in the arrest of 81 of the fugitives, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF said it had lost control of Shaddadi prison in the afternoon after \"Damascus-affiliated factions\" mounted a series of attacks and killed of dozens of its fighters, who it said had been attempting to \"prevent a serious security catastrophe\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">SDF spokesman Farhad Shami said around 1,500 IS members had escaped during the clashes, according to Reuters news agency.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ee84/live/a6f20c40-f62c-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Syrian government forces advance along a road in Hassakeh province, north-eastern Syria (20 January 2026)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The government says it has given the SDF four days to formulate a plan on the future of Hassakeh province</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF also accused government forces of attacking al-Aqtan prison, north of the city of Raqqa, which is holding IS members and leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, a statement said the prison's buildings and facilities had been shelled and its water supply cut off. \"These practices constitute a blatant violation of humanitarian standards and pose a serious threat to the lives of the detainees,\" it warned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the defence ministry denied that there had been clashes in the vicinity of the prison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the facility was \"fully secured\", with military police and internal security forces deployed around the facility and in contact with the administration to ensure supplies were provided.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, which was once the SDF's main ally in Syria, was monitoring developments in Syria with \"grave concern\", a White House official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, avoid actions that could further escalate tensions, and prioritize the protection of civilians across all minority groups,\" they added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Special envoy Tom Barrack meanwhile explained that the rationale for the US-SDF partnership had \"largely expired\", and that his country was currently focused on ensuring the security of facilities holding IS prisoners and facilitating talks between the SDF and President Sharaa's government on implementation of the ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This moment offers a pathway to full integration into a unified Syrian state with citizenship rights, cultural protections, and political participation - long denied under Bashar al-Assad's regime,\" he wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After signing the deal with the SDF on Sunday, Sharaa said he hoped it would allow Syria to \"end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress\".

Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of £101m a year. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said that was necessary to protect the base from \"malign influence\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before signing the deal, the UK offered Trump an effective veto, because of its implications for US security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Allies of the president had criticised the plan, but during a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yxxjr8v2vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">meeting with Sir Keir in the Oval Office</a> last February, Trump said \"I think we'll be inclined to go along with your country\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the agreement was signed in May, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-support-for-uk-and-mauritius-agreement-on-chagos-archipelago\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Washington \"welcomed\" the deal.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said it secured the \"long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint US-UK military facility at Diego Garcia\", which he described as a \"critical asset for regional and global security.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio added that \"President Trump expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/4004\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A government bill</a> to implement the agreement between the UK and Mauritian governments is currently in its final stages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said in a post on X that the prime minister now had \"the chance to change course on Chagos\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said that \"paying to surrender the Chagos Islands is not just an act of stupidity, but of complete self sabotage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who has long been a critic of the deal, said in a post on X: \"Thank goodness Trump has vetoed the surrender of the Chagos islands\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Liberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey said Trump's comments showed Sir Keir's approach to the US president \"has failed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chagos Deal was sold as proof the government could work with him, now it's falling apart,\" Davey said in a post on X. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's time for the government to stand up to Trump; appeasing a bully never works.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Labour MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Emily Thornberry, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while the UK should take Trump \"seriously\", it should not take his comments \"literally\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She described his comments on Tuesday as an example of \"presidential trolling\", saying she was \"in favour of keeping calm and trying to sit this out\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two British Chagossian women born on Diego Garcia - Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe - want the right to return to their place of birth and say they were excluded from discussions over the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pompe told the BBC she views the US president's criticism of the deal as a \"good thing\" but \"only words\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over WhatsApp, Dugasse said: \"I want the deal to stop and not [see] money [given] to the Mauritius government.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said Chagossians should be allowed to \"sit at the table and decide our future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-alice-cuddy\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Alice Cuddy</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters People sleeping in a metro station in Kyiv\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Around 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue. It must end as soon as possible,\" said Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎ on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kyiv city administration said more than 10,000 people, including nearly 800 children, took refuge in the city's metro stations on Monday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the high-rise buildings that are often hit by drones do not have shelters, so the deep metro system is still the only place people can seek safety as the thudding sounds of air defence systems ring overhead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Zelensky said Ukraine had received missiles to repel the overnight attack on Monday, and added they had helped significantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he also emphasised the need for air defence systems was still critical. In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles,\" Zelensky stressed. \"In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-liubov-sholudko.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In late 2024, he was again named publicly as the head of what authorities described as the \"military wing\" of a broader conspiracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Damiba first seized power in January 2022, toppling the elected government of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré amid frustration over the state's failure to curb Islamist violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after just eight months, he was himself overthrown by Traoré, then a 34‑year‑old artillery officer who accused him of failing to deliver security improvements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the Traoré-led junta has tightened its grip on the country, expelling French forces, adopting an assertive nationalist stance and recently reinstating the death penalty, including for crimes of high treason.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite promises to restore order, Burkina Faso remains mired in one of the world's most severe security crises, with militant jihadist attacks continuing across large parts of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The return of Damiba to Burkina Faso, under arrest and possibly facing a long list of criminal charges, is expected to escalate tensions within the military and political establishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Political observers suggest that repeated accusations, foiled plots and widening divisions within the armed forces will likely lead to questions about the stability of a government still confronting both a brutal insurgency and internal rivalries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-natasha-booty\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting-by-natasha-booty\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting by Natasha Booty</b></i></p></div></div></body></html>"

A standing ovation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On top of that, there was an astonishing scrum to try to get in, with many turned away - even heads of state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The security was unbelievable, not letting even some of the most famous attendees in or out of the hall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minutes into the speech, Trump was keeping his cool - even dropping in phrases about wanting the UK \"to do great\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What some thought would be the day on which the US president laid down the laws of his new global economy was filled more with grandfatherly advice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was far from the mildly menacing tone of his social media posts claiming that Greenland will be America's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But which one is the real Donald Trump? Has he heard how badly some of his rhetoric has gone down?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As I entered, I was told of an astonishing event last night where Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told the audience that, in terms of Europe's economy, \"you're dead\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was a walkout. Might there have been one today?

He announced he was seeking immediate negotiations for the USA to acquire Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A negotiated settlement, he said. No force required. But the US needed \"full title\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We want this land\" to build the \"greatest Golden Dome ever built\", he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about his words a day earlier, though stressing that he would also use Greenland to defend Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm asking for a piece of ice... it's a very small ask.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was incredible to see this said out loud.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mixed reactions in the room</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was high security, high stakes and high tension in the Alps for the arrival of the would-be sheriff of the world, brandishing his new rules.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reaction in the room ranged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president's attempts at charm seemed to win him polite applause. But as he went from rigged elections to his annoyance at other leaders' Davos speeches, some sat in disbelief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though he promised not to invade Greenland, many were stunned by his attempts to persuade Europe to hand over the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California said the speech was \"TACO\" Tuesday, a reference to the \"Trump always chickens out\" catchphrase used to mock the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argued Trump had backed down after robust pushback from leaders Emmanuel Macron and Mark Carney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A key Republican senator, Thomas Tillis, said the president's pursuit of Greenland, even a negotiated annexation, would not have the backing of Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So while Trump attempted to dial down tensions, he still criticised allies - including personal attacks on leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while he promised not to invade Greenland, he still said it will be part of the new America - and that the world should thank him for it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The speech may have eventually come to an end, but we will be talking about it for a long time to come.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In some cases, we were told, the only identifier was a bank card laid on top of a body bag – the victims' last remaining possession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has separately corroborated videos from the same mortuary that demonstrate the violence perpetrated against protesters. One shows the body of what appears to be a child, while another shows a man with a clear gunshot wound in the middle of his head. Both videos are too distressing to show. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Iranians have been posting the names of victims killed by security forces when they manage to connect to the internet through Starlink or even using networks from neighbouring countries, though these opportunities are incredibly rare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We checked the names of victims identified in the mortuary against social media posts reporting the names of the dead and found five matches, but are not revealing the names as we cannot contact the victims' families.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cre28d2j2zxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">tracked the spread of anti-government protests</a> across 71 towns and cities in Iran since they first erupted on 28 December through verified video, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely much higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The few images that people have managed to upload through Starlink show burnt-out cars left in the streets, while verified videos recorded rounds of gunshots fired around Tehran during protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to document the full extent of the death toll from the protests. However, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has placed its current estimate at more than 4,000 deaths.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Passengers became scared and the carriage went silent, he said, \"and then we heard a crash\" and the train stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Luggage fell and the lights went out. Then they started to hear noises of pain and screams from the three carriages behind them that had derailed, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He and his girlfriend were uninjured, but people were in shock and crying, some experiencing panic attacks. A nurse beside him responded to a call for medical volunteers, and when she came back from the sixth carriage she told him someone had died. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Surviving passengers from the derailed carriages broke glass and went on the tracks to escape. Passengers helped one another get down, and he saw seriously injured people, with bleeding heads and improvised bandages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first on the scene were people from Adamuz, some in their pyjamas, who offered to transport the injured, Lucas Merayo said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After two hours, they were evacuated by bus and Lucas eventually made it back home to Madrid on Monday morning, when he hugged his eight-year-old son and began to cry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's really, really shocking and overwhelming to be alive when everyone else is not,\" said the actor and influencer, who is from Argentina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the experience of the crash is \"going to be with me all the time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As it was dark, he had not realised the oncoming train had fallen into an embankment until he saw it on the news.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f34f/live/6e7581d0-f532-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via Reuters A person in white forensic overall saying 'Guardia Civil Criminalistica' hold a camera up to photograph the front of the train on the tracks.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Spanish Guardia Civil / Handout via Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Spanish Civil Guard arrived on scene to assess the situation and begin the evaluation process</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president of the Andalusian regional government, Juanma Moreno, told local outlet Canal Sur they had to bring in \"heavy machinery\" to \"practically lift\" parts of the second train, which \"has taken the worst part of this accident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Córdoba, told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rescuers continued to search the wreckage until Wednesday when a 43rd victim was found.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What caused the crash?</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Footage inside Spanish train as passengers evacuate</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What caused the train to derail remains unclear. The transport minister, Óscar Puente, described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska was quick to rule out sabotage but said  all other hypotheses were being considered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of Renfe \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error. Álvaro Fernández Heredia said even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it and both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators have been focusing on a 30cm gap in the straight section of track that the Iryo train passed over and the transport secretary has said they are assessing if that broken section was the \"cause or the result\" of the crash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Óscar Puente has confirmed reports that grooves the size of a coin were found on the wheels of the first five carriages of the Iryo train that went over the track safely before the next three carriages derailed. Two or three trains that had gone over the track shortly beforehand had similar notches, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have suggested that a welding failure on the track may have led to it breaking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a transcript has been published by daily El País of calls to the control centre in Madrid from the Iryo driver and from the conductor on the Renfe train.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iryo driver is initially unaware his train has been involved in a severe crash. The control centre is unable to reach the driver of the Renfe train so contacts the conductor who says \"I have blood on my head.

But now, a growing number are siding with Democrats in Congress and Nato allies who say a takeover of Greenland would violate US and international law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, some Republican leaders have said there's little interest in the US buying Greenland or seizing it through military force. The White House had previously left the military option on the table but on Wednesday it was ruled out by Trump in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican lawmakers have also joined Democrats in opposing a new plan by Trump to place tariffs on countries that don't back his bid to acquire the territory, which is self-governed but controlled by Denmark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The proposed tariffs would be \"bad for America, bad for American businesses, and bad for America's allies,\" Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina wrote on social media, adding that the move would benefit China and Russia. \"It's great for [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] and other adversaries who want to see Nato divided.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Republicans said Trump's ambition to annex Greenland was threatening to undermine the Nato alliance - to which both the US and Denmark belong - in a moment of growing tension between the US and European allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued the US must own the territory to better compete with China and Russia in the Arctic, and has vowed to take it \"one way or another\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the US president downplayed concerns that the issue was hurting Nato when asked by the BBC if he was willing to see the decades-old security alliance collapse as a consequence of his push for the territory. Trump reiterated his view that ownership of Greenland was critical for US and global security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need [Greenland] for national security and even world security,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC asks if breakup of Nato is price Trump willing to pay for Greenland</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump's insistence on obtaining the territory is increasingly unpopular on Capitol Hill, as more Republicans have come forward to break ranks publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska, a Trump critic, said Trump's push for Greenland could lead to an impeachment investigation. And the Republican leaders in each chamber of Congress, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson, said they opposed a military intervention in Greenland, when Trump was refusing to rule that out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Republicans have voiced support for Trump. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said on Sunday that it was \"overwhelmingly in America's national interest\" to own Greenland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it comes to Greenland, I want to commend President Trump, for being single-mindedly focused on America First, on US economic interests, and US national security interests,\" Cruz said in a Fox News interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress has some options to try to rein Trump in, if Republicans and Democrats do choose to pick a fight with the president over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress has the power of the purse and in theory would have to approve funding used to buy Greenland, experts said. Denmark and Greenland have both insisted the island isn't for sale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If Trump wants to buy Greenland it would require an act of Congress to provide the funds to do so,\" said Daniel Schuman, the executive director of the American Governance Institute and an expert on congressional procedure. It's unlikely that Congress could repurpose existing funding to buy the territory, Schuman added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the administration has expanded the use of executive power to enact Trump's immigration and tariff agenda, among other issues. The administration might try to claim some new authority to seize Greenland that would allow it to overrule any roadblocks by Congress, Schuman said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawmakers worried about a military incursion in Greenland have signalled support for measures prohibiting any US action without congressional approval. But it's unclear if the proposals have enough Republican support to pass in either chamber of Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five Senate Republicans joined Democrats earlier this month to advance a bill that would have blocked the administration from taking further military action in Venezuela, following the attack in December that deposed former President Nicolás Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuela war powers resolution ultimately failed to get through the Senate. But it signalled mounting frustration from Republican and Democratic lawmakers with Trump's use of military force abroad, after he ran in 2024 on a promise to reduce US involvement in foreign conflicts. Last week a bipartisan congressional delegation visited Denmark in a symbolic show of support for Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also unclear how the Senate, which ratifies treaties, would respond if the US reached some sort of agreement with Denmark to take over part or all of Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has an existing arrangement with Denmark established in 1951 that allows the US to expand its military presence in Greenland. Murkowski and other Republicans have argued that the US doesn't need to take over the territory to address national security needs in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senate could try to thwart Trump by opposing a treaty between the US and Denmark, in the event the two nations reach an agreement. Treaties require two-thirds support in the Senate for ratification, which Republicans currently fall well short of.  </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ac52/live/eda48cb0-f6ab-11f0-a917-d3d793525367.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Senator Lisa Murkowski, flanked by other members of the US Congress, speaks at a press conference in Copenhagen\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Last week, a US bipartisan delegation which included Senator Lisa Murkowski (C) visited Denmark in a show of solidarity with the US ally</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republicans have already indicated that they'd consider breaking with Trump over Greenland.

But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on

commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United

of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded

his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is no denying Trump's

We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of cheese and is mostly eaten with naan, a type of bread, and rice\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of paneer cheese</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, the university settled the lawsuit. Such settlements are usually arrived at to avoid lengthy and expensive court battles for both parties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the terms of the settlement, the university agreed to give the students their degrees but denied all liabilities and banned them from studying or working there in future.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its statement shared with the BBC, the university added: \"CU Boulder's Anthropology Department has worked to rebuild trust among students, faculty and staff.

Loomer has denied being racist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Below the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time.

The city's residents would frequent it in droves, particularly ahead of festivals, weddings and other important occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What started the fire is still unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But witnesses say the speed at which it spread, a lack of working fire exits and the density of shoppers and stalls crammed into the building exacerbated the disaster.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Muhammed Amin's brother is still missing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rehan Faisal, who owned a bedsheet shop, said that he was able to escape because his shop was located near one of the exits - he broke down the door to get out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that although his staff had heard there was a fire in one part of the market, they had initially not worried because it was located some distance away from them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No-one knew it would spread so much,\" Faisal added, saying it only took about \"five to seven minutes\" for everything to \"burn before our eyes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shoiab, 19, who worked at a decorations shop, said he first heard about the fire on a lower floor at around 22:00 local time (17:00 GMT) on Saturday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many customers and shopkeepers were coming up... and saying there was a fire downstairs.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters news agency that all but three of the centre's 16 exits were locked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shoiab was among the luckier ones.

Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA People gather to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the train collision that occurred on 18 January, in Punta Umbria, Huelva, Spain, on 20 January 2026.

Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result of Sunday's crash, and the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m78xl0gmpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver</a> near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The notice was followed soon by a demolition order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\"

when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The West Bank was split into three categories of territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

He promised the economy would be the primary thing, but I don't know that it's completely been that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In comparison from what I remember from the last Trump administration, I feel like I was doing a lot better then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We still have a lot of things that [the Trump administration] is working through, so we'll see. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Devynn De Velasco, 22, Nebraska</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This independent voter is worried about how Trump's focus on foreign policy will ultimately impact the US economy.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the first few months he'd reference the economy, but I can't tell you the last time I've seen reporters questioning Trump about the economy let alone he addresses it on his own. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My husband and I are honestly worried about an economic collapse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We've been saving a lot of money - thinking of buying a house - but we have that in the back of our mind that if there is some sort of problem, we do have a full safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Politics and the economy are very much linked, so what our president does impacts the economy. So the threats to Greenland and Denmark and these remarks about Nato has made me quite anxious. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Denise Demontagnac, 21, Maryland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This registered Democrat graduated from university last year, and she has not been able to find work since, despite a job market the president has touted.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One year post graduation, I have not been able to find a stable job which is extremely impacting my life and my family's life as well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not that I haven't applied for jobs. I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are \"marginally ahead\" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that. I do not think the policies have created enough growth so that it overshadows the cost increases that we're seeing at the same time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I hope that the Federal Reserve retains enough autonomy to manage independently.
