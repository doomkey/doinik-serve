The deal is due to expire in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 during President Donald Trump's first term, with the leader saying it did too little to stop Iran from creating a pathway to a nuclear bomb. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With its withdrawal, all US sanctions were re-imposed on Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Iran retaliated by increasingly breaching the restrictions. In May, the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said it had more than 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity - well above the level used for civilian purposes and close to weapons grade. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June Iran's parliament suspended cooperation with the IAEA after tensions with Israel and the US came to a head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel launched attacks on Iran's nuclear facilities the same month, triggering a 12-day war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US bombed a number of Iran's nuclear sites, bringing US-Iran talks to an abrupt end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Following the strikes, the E3 countries stepped up warnings to Iran about its suspension of cooperation with the IAEA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has contacted the UK Foreign Office for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Iranian mission to the UN did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.</p></div></div></body></html>"

During that period 7,666 British soldiers served at the base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It notes that of those, 26 cases happened before training on the new rule was initiated for all army staff in November of that year, with nine reported cases since then. In the majority of cases, the allegation that soldiers had paid for sex was never proven.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to those detailed in the report, the Foreign Office told the BBC there was a small number - less than five - cases of alleged use of sex workers currently under investigation. The alleged incidents happened after the inquiry was concluded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report said that despite the training given by the Army and the control measures in place, the reality was that \"transactional sexual activity\" by UK personnel in Kenya was still happening, and that \"the level is somewhere between low and moderate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is not out of control, but the best way for the Army to manage the risk is for the Army to assume it may be at the upper end of that scale between low and moderate,\" the report added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report noted efforts by the Army to stamp out the practice, including regular training and the use of \"sharkwatch\" patrols with a non-commissioned officer of the rank of sergeant or above deployed to monitor the conduct of junior personnel when they left the base for nights out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The army said it would implement recommendations from the report, including making it easier to dismiss soldiers found to have used sex workers and the implementation of additional training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report follows years of controversy about the conduct of soldiers at Batuk sparked by an investigation by the Sunday Times in 2021 which revealed the alleged involvement of a British soldier in the murder of Ms Wanjiru, a mother of one whose body was found dumped in a septic tank near a hotel where she had been seen with soldiers on the night she vanished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Separately in Kenya,  MPs have been conducting an inquiry into wider allegations of mistreatment of local people by soldiers at Batuk and have heard claims at public hearings of injuries allegedly sustained through the behaviour of British troops and of soldiers fathering children to Kenyan mothers and then abandoning them when they returned home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June this year a soldier stationed at the base was sent back to the UK after being accused of rape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Service Inquiry behind the latest report said it had spoken to many local Kenyans and found \"the vast majority\" of local residents were happy with the presence of the Batuk camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div></div></body></html>"

He was residing in North Carolina before he was taken into custody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also known as Fredo, Fred Lion, Leo Danger, and Lepe Blode, he helped raise funds that were then used to pay gang leaders and purchase weapons, according to officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both men helped \"bankroll Cherizier's violent criminal enterprise, which is driving a security crisis in Haiti\", said Assistant US Attorney General John Eisenberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that the US \"will continue to pursue those who enable Haiti's violence and instability\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, US officials designated Viv Ansanm, which has controlled the capital since around 2020, as a foreign terrorist organisation.

However, he remains in a position of significant power on the streets and is protected by his group's members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then the country - the poorest in the Americas - has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control and increasingly violent gang warfare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent months, a UN backed Kenyan led security force has failed to take back control of the Haitian capital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the humanitarian crisis in the country has sunk to new levels.

He has also repeatedly argued that the war \"never would have happened\" if he had been president at the time of Russia's invasion in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month, Trump told the BBC that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1e02q12z32o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">he was \"disappointed\" by Putin.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Frustrations grew and Trump set an 8 August deadline for Putin to agree to an immediate ceasefire or face more severe US sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the deadline hit, Trump instead announced he and Putin would meet in person on 15 August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The meeting comes after US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff held \"highly productive\" talks with Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, according to Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of the meeting, the White House sought to play down speculation that the bilateral could yield a ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is a listening exercise for the president,\" said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. She added that Trump may travel to Russia following the Alaska trip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump said he viewed the summit as a \"feel-out meeting\" aimed at urging Putin to end the war.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Is Ukraine attending?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend. Trump said on Monday: \"I would say he could go, but he's been to a lot of meetings.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump did, however, say that Zelensky would be the first person he would call afterwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A White House official later said that Trump and Zelensky would meet virtually on Wednesday, ahead of the US president's summit with Putin. The Zelensky meeting will be joined by several European leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin had requested that Zelensky be excluded, although the White House has previously said that Trump was willing to hold a trilateral in which all three leaders were present.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky has said any agreements without input from Ukraine would amount to \"dead decisions\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What do both sides hope to get out of it? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While both Russia and Ukraine have long said that they want the war to end, both countries want things that the other harshly opposes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump said on Monday he was \"going to try to get some of that [Russian-occupied] territory back for Ukraine\". But he also warned that there might have to be \"some swapping, changes in land\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukraine, however, has been adamant that it will not accept Russian control of regions that Moscow has seized, including Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky pushed back this week against any idea of \"swapping\" territories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We will not reward Russia for what it has perpetrated,\" the Ukrainian president said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'We're going to change the battle lines' Trump on the war in Ukraine</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Putin has not budged from his territorial demands, Ukraine's neutrality and the future size of its army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, over Putin's belief the Western defensive alliance, Nato, was using the neighbouring country to gain a foothold to bring its troops closer to Russia's borders.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Trump administration has been attempting to sway European leaders on a ceasefire deal that would hand over swathes of Ukrainian territory to Russia, the BBC's US partner CBS News has reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agreement would allow Russia to keep control of the Crimean peninsula, and take the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, which is made up of Donetsk and Luhansk, according to sources familiar with the talks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia illegally occupied Crimea in 2014 and its forces control the majority of the Donbas region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the deal, Russia would have to give up the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where it currently has some military control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to Fox News, US Vice-President JD Vance said any future deal was \"not going to make anybody super happy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You've got to make peace here… you can't finger point,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The way to peace is to have a decisive leader to sit down and force people to come together.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Will the gamble pay off? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. \"It's day to day,\" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,\" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why rare earths matter</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The phrase \"rare earths\" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors  - is something of a misnomer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,\" Professor Eksteen explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windscreen wipers and braking sensors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact \"somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck\", Professor Eksteen adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,\" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,\" Professor Eksteen explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030.

Then in 2019, the UN banned countries from using these workers in an attempt to cut off Kim's funds and stop him building nuclear weapons, meaning most were sent home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But last year more than 10,000 labourers were sent to Russia, according to a South Korean intelligence official speaking to the BBC on the condition of anonymity. They told us that even more were expected to arrive this year, and in total Pyongyang would eventually dispatch more than 50,000 workers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sudden influx means North Korean workers are now \"everywhere in Russia,\" the official added.

Most workers go hoping to escape poverty and be able to buy a house for their family or start a business when they return. Only the most trusted men are selected after being rigorously vetted, and they must leave their families behind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the bulk of their earnings is sent straight to the North Korean state as \"loyalty fees\". The remaining fraction – usually between $100-200 (£74-£149) a month  - is marked down on a ledger. The workers only receive this money when they return home – a recent tactic, experts say, to stop them running away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Once the men realise the reality of the harsh work and lack of pay, it can be shattering. Tae said he was \"ashamed\" when he learnt that other construction workers from central Asia were being paid five times more than him for a third of the work. \"I felt like I was in a labour camp; a prison without bars,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The labourer Jin still bristles when he remembers how the other workers would call them slaves. \"You are not men, just machines that can speak,\" they jeered. At one point, Jin's manager told him he might not receive any money when he returned to North Korea because the state needed it instead. It was then he decided to risk his life to escape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tae made the decision to defect after watching YouTube videos showing how much workers in South Korea were paid. One night, he packed his belongings into a bin liner, stuffed a blanket under his bed sheets to make it look as if he was still sleeping, and crept out of his construction site. He hailed a taxi and travelled thousands of kilometres across the country to meet a lawyer who helped arrange his journey on to Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent years, a small number of workers have been able to orchestrate their escapes using forbidden second-hand smartphones, bought by saving the small daily allowance they received for cigarettes and alcohol.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A handful of labourers have managed to escape Russia during the war and reach Seoul</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In an attempt to prevent these escapes, multiple sources have told us that the North Korean authorities are now cracking down on workers' already limited freedom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Prof Kang from Dong-A University, one way the regime has tried to control the workers over the last year is by subjecting them to more frequent ideological training and self-criticism sessions, in which they are forced to declare their loyalty to Kim Jong Un and log their failings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare opportunities to leave construction sites have also been cut. \"The workers used to go out in groups once a month, but recently these trips have reduced to almost zero,\" Prof Kang added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kim Seung-chul, a Seoul-based activist who helps rescue North Korean workers from Russia, said these outings were being more tightly controlled. \"They used to be allowed to leave in pairs, but since 2023 they have had to travel in groups of five and are monitored more intensely.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In this climate, fewer workers are managing to escape. The South Korean government told us the number of North Koreans making it out of Russia each year and arriving in Seoul had halved since 2022 - from around 20 a year to just 10.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Lankov, the expert in North Korea-Russia relations, said the crackdowns were likely in preparation for many more workers arriving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These workers will be the lasting legacy of Kim and Putin's wartime friendship,\" he said, arguing the workers would continue arriving long after the war had ended, and the deployment of soldiers and weapons had ceased.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jake-kwon-and-hosu-lee\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

from goods and services to contracts for public works such as roads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some 40,000 high-value tenders worth £38bn from federal ministries will now be open to bidding for UK businesses in strategic sectors like transport, green energy and infrastructure - areas which have thus far been heavily protected from foreign competition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The access is unprecedented, trade experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is \"far greater\" than what India had offered in its earlier agreement with the United Arab Emirates and \"sets a new benchmark\", Ajay Srivastava of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think-tank, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the agreement, UK firms bidding for Indian government contracts in specified areas will be treated almost on par with Indian suppliers and also have real-time access to information on forthcoming public tenders and procurement opportunities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also, goods from the UK made with just 20% domestic input can now be supplied to the Indian government, allowing UK companies the flexibility to source up to 80% of the parts or raw material from other countries and still qualify for procurement preference in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minimum contract value at which these firms can bid for government projects has also been sharply reduced as a result of which \"UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects - such as rural roads, solar equipment for schools, or IT systems for government offices - that were previously out of reach\", said Mr Srivastava.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250807-104329-14652b2216-web-2.27.0-5/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a0d5/live/93bb4970-774c-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A rural village mud road in Purulia district, West Bengal flanked by fields and coconut trees. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">UK companies can now bid on a wide range of lower-value projects such as rural roads</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But for British companies, realising this opportunity on the ground will be easier said than done, several experts told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While UK suppliers are eligible to participate as Class-II local suppliers, Indian companies will continue to get preferential treatment as Class-I suppliers, says Dr Arpita Mukherjee, a trade expert with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moreover, pricing plays a key role in winning contracts, and \"UK companies tend to have higher prices\" compared with Indian companies, which will be a major challenge for them, she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A more significant deterrent will be delayed payments and difficult contract enforcement, which are \"major legacy issues when it comes to public procurement in India\", says Srijan Shukla of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He says a study on procurement by India's central public sector enterprises from 2017 to 2020 found that pending payments to suppliers were often more than the total average procurement in a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This will impact UK players trying to enter India's public procurement markets, especially when it comes to public contracts that have long-time horizons and are subject to regulatory and political uncertainties,\" Mr Shukla told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pending dues have been a major irritant for India's small businesses too, leading to short-term liquidity issues that often \"force them out of these procurement markets and reallocate that business to the big players\", according to Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Much of this is reflected in India's poor ranking - 163 out of 190 - on contract enforcement in the World Bank's Doing Business report, the latest round of which was in 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things have improved since these rankings were published - with one-stop-shop portals like Government e-Marketplace, the Central Public Procurement Portal or the recently launched online dispute resolution portal bringing more transparency to the public tendering process - payment discipline by government entities continues to remain a challenge, says Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to Ms Mukherjee, the India-UK trade agreement emphasises transparency in procurement but omits issues like pending dues, contract enforcement and penalties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She adds the deal excludes the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement's dispute settlement provisions for four years after the CETA takes effect - these provisions usually define how disputes are resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Doing business in India is an acquired skill. Over time, companies from the UK will have to learn the way to work around complexities regarding the art of winning public tenders and navigating though complex regulations,\" Mr Shukla says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250807-104329-14652b2216-web-2.27.0-5/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/88a2/live/76e56e60-774d-11f0-abe9-9dbc4fadc5ac.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman worker with a headscarf, wearing a maroon tunic, handles a sheet of processed leather at a tannery in Jalandhar, Punjab, India,. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">India's public procurement market has long been reserved for local small and medium enterprises</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite the niggling issues, allowing foreign players entry into India's government procurement market marks a far-reaching policy shift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It shows the Indian government's intentions to open up a space that has long been reserved for local small and medium enterprises, and could be reflective of the concessions Delhi is willing to give foreign players in future trade agreements like <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz71w1dgl84o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the one being negotiated with the US</a>, according to GTRI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India is late to including deep government procurement clauses in trade deals, making its current efforts a catch-up game, says Mr Shukla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is also a sign, he says, of the Indian government's \"confidence that its own firms can compete with global firms both externally and at home\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The hope is that more foreign players will force more accountability from the Indian government and \"help standardise\" its tendering and public procurement process - marked by payment delays and poor contract enforcement - to global standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
