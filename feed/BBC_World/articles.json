Immigration agents pull up to the vehicle parked in the street, emerge from the truck and tell the woman behind the wheel to get out of the SUV. One of the agents tugs at the driver's side door handle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another agent is positioned near the front of the vehicle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not clear exactly how close the agent is standing or whether he was struck by the vehicle based on the videos reviewed immediately by the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That agent opens fire as the maroon SUV attempts to drive off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three pops are heard, and the vehicle can be seen losing control and crashing into a car parked nearby along the street. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on Truth Social, Trump said an ICE officer was \"viciously\" run over. \"It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital,\" he wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Republican president also blamed the \"Radical Left\" for \"threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis police chief Brian O'Hara said the driver was in her vehicle and was blocking the roadway on Portland Avenue. She was then approached on foot by a federal law enforcement officer, \"and she began to drive off\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman was \"stalking and impeding\" officers throughout the day and tried to \"weaponise her vehicle\" in an attempt to run over the officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The federal agent fired \"defensive shots\" and was himself injured, Noem said, before he was treated and discharged from a local hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minneapolis City Council, however, said in a statement that Good was simply \"caring for her neighbours\" when she was shot and killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same agent was also hit by a car in the line of duty in June, Noem said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that ICE operations in the city would continue, and the FBI would investigate Wednesday's incident.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/80e5/live/267d1760-ec01-11f0-b35a-ab7e077318c5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Police tape is shown blocking off a snow-covered residential street.

She said she heard agents shouting at a woman driving an SUV, then one agent tried to open her car door, and the driver went into reverse and began pulling away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An ICE agent stepped in front of her vehicle and said, 'Stop!' and then - I mean, she was already moving - and then, point blank, shot her through her windshield in the face,\" Heller told the US network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota State Governor Tim Walz also pushed back on federal accounts of the incident.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Don't believe this propaganda machine,\" Walz wrote in response to a Department of Homeland Security post about the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Top Democrats, including former Vice-President Kamala Harris and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, also released statements. Harris called the Trump administration's version of events \"gaslighting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protests and marches took place in several parts of the city as some outraged Minneapolis residents condemned the shooting and called for ICE to leave. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main gathering was near the scene of the shooting, which is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protests were being organised in other US cities, including New Orleans, Miami, Seattle and New York City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis Public Schools announced that classes were cancelled for the rest of the week, \"due to safety concern\".

The UK Royal Navy gave logistical support by air and sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was accused by the US of \"conducting illicit activities\" and boarded in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The moves come as the US seeks to choke off most exports of Venezuelan crude oil, and just days after its special forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a lightning raid on his residence in Caracas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X: \"The blockade of sanctioned and illicit Venezuelan oil remains in FULL EFFECT - anywhere in the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow has denounced the seizure of the tanker sailing under its flag, and demanded that the US treat Russians aboard properly and permits them to return to Russia quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The transport ministry said it had given the vessel \"temporary permission\" to use the Russian flag, adding that no state had the right to use force against vessels properly registered in other states' jurisdictions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggested that Russia dispatched a submarine to safeguard the vessel, but it appears that US forces were able to board the tanker without facing any resistance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House described the ship as a \"Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag and had a judicial order\" against it.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's leadership is co-operating with the US on the second tanker seized in the Caribbean, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they co-operate and work with the United States,\" he told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier, US President Donald Trump had said that Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio, who briefed US lawmakers on the ongoing operation in Venezuela on Wednesday, said that the US would sell oil that is in Venezuela \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the US had a considered plan for the future of Venezuela, and that the administration was \"not just winging it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio said the Trump administration's plan in Venezuela was stabilisation, recovery and then transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the discussions surrounding oil were only one component of concern US lawmakers had over the escalating conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers needed answers to lingering questions of how many US troops could be involved and how much money the US involvement in Venezuela will cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans largely appeared to back the administration's moves in the region, though some expressed concern about what kind of say Congress had.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senate is expected to vote next week on a bipartisan war powers resolution - an attempt to block continued military action in Venezuela. A war powers resolution - created in the wake of the Vietnam War - limits a president's power to involve US armed forces in hostilities without congressional approval.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we're going to have continued engagement in the next phase, I think it has got to be subject to [war powers],\" North Carolina's Thom Tillis said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Missouri's Josh Hawley said that if the administration's actions were a law enforcement operation, then it does not require congressional approval, but \"if it's a military operation involving a foreign head of government, even one we don't recognise officially, that's a very different situation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China - the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years - has condemned the US moves and accused it of threatening global energy security.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a8f/live/e19d4790-ebe3-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US European Command A US Coast Guard official looks through binoculars at the ship Marinera (former name Bella 1).

The US Coast Guard is escorting M/T Sophia to the US for final disposition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Southern Command also posted a video showing a helicopter circling over a vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that \"in two pre-dawn operations today, the Coast Guard conducted back-to-back meticulously co-ordinated boarding of two 'ghost fleet' tanker ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said both seized vessels \"were either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it\".</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Earlier this week, Trump had issued a warning to Petro, telling him to \"watch his ass\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia is a key hub for the region's drug trade - most notably cocaine - as well as having substantial oil reserves. It is also a major producer of gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn7p7g79wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">control sales of Venezuelan oil</a> \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets, according to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One following the operation in Venezuela, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump added: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, Petro warned that Colombia would \"take up arms\" if the US launched any military action against his country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people's jaguar,\" Petro wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honor\", and said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Colombian counterpart would make arrangements for Petro to travel to Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkl2dm2glxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> imposed sanctions on Petro</a> in October, saying he was failing to curb drug trafficking and was allowing cartels to \"flourish\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that since Petro came to power in 2022, cocaine production in Colombia had \"exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro responded he had been fighting drug trafficking \"for decades\" and that his administration had stemmed the growth of coca crops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Venezuela, Colombia is home to substantial oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodríguez said the US action to depose Maduro was a \"stain on our relations such as had never occurred in our history\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she added: \"Venezuela is open to energy relations where all parties benefit.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The henchmen are still there.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's risky as hell.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the alternative, involving wholesale regime change and backing Machado's opposition movement, would have involved other dangers, including potential infighting among opposition figures and the alienation of those Venezuelans – perhaps as many as 30% – who voted for Maduro.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"I want a president who's involved\" - Michiganders weigh in on Maduro's seizure</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his dramatic press conference on Saturday morning, President Trump shocked many observers by dismissing the Nobel Peace Prize winner Machado as \"not respected\" inside Venezuela, while describing Rodríguez as \"gracious.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was very surprised to hear the disqualification of María Corina Machado by President Trump,\" Kevin Whitaker, former deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Caracas, says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Her movement was massively elected…and so disqualifying Machado, in effect, disqualified that whole movement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The speed, and apparent ease, with which Maduro was removed and Rodríguez installed led some observers to speculate that the former vice president might have been in on the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's very telling that we just went after Maduro and the vice president survived,\" says former CIA officer Lindsay Moran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's obvious that there were high-placed sources. My immediate speculation was that those high placed sources were in the office of the VP, if not the VP herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Phil Gunson, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group who lives in Caracas, says the conspiracy theory doesn't stand up to close scrutiny, given that enormous power still rests with Venezuela's defence minister, General Vladimir Padrino Lopez, and hardline interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, both loyal Maduro allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why would she sell out Maduro, leaving her defenceless, internally, against the guys who really control the guns,\" Gunson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the decision to back Rodríguez followed warnings that installing Machado could result in dangerous levels of instability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, an ICG report warned that \"Washington should beware of regime change.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The risks of violence in any post-Maduro scenario should not be downplayed,\" the report urged, saying elements of the security forces could launch a guerilla war against the new authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were warning people in the administration, this is not going to work,\" Gunson says. \"There will be violent chaos, it will be your fault and you'll own it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a classified US intelligence assessment reaching the same conclusions and determining that members of the Maduro regime, including Rodríguez, were in a better position to lead a temporary government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House hasn't commented publicly on the report, but made it clear that it plans to work with Rodríguez for the foreseeable future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It belies a bit of hard-nosed realism on the part of the Trump administration, says Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow with the Americas Program at Washington's Centre for Strategic and International Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the challenges, he says, have only just begun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The capture of Maduro was the easy part. The broader rebuilding of Venezuela, the oil, drugs and democracy goals…are going to take much more time to come to fruition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, though, Rodríguez seems to be someone the Trump administration feels it can deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She's been a bit of an economic reformer,\" Gunson says. \"She's aware of the need for an economic opening and she's not averse to the idea of bringing back foreign capital.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: The key questions on Trump’s actions on Venezuela</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ziemer agrees that Rodríguez may not find it difficult to do Washington's bidding when it comes to rolling out the welcome mat for US oil companies, offering greater cooperation on counter-narcotics and even scaling down Venezuela's relations with Cuba, China and Russia, especially if it means the gradual lifting of US sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think she can deliver on that,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if the US is asking for genuine progress towards a democratic transition, that becomes much harder.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, this does not appear to be high on Washington's list of priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In remarks to the press on Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of a three-stage plan for Venezuela, starting with stabilisation of the country and the marketing of 30-50 million barrels of oil under US supervision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan would lead to what Rubio called \"a process of reconciliation\", including amnesties for opposition forces, the release of political prisoners and the rebuilding of civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The third phase, of course, will be one of transition,\" he said, without elaborating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Article 233 of Venezuela's constitution calls for fresh elections within 30 days of a president becoming \"permanently unavailable to serve,\" something that would seem to apply to a situation in which Maduro languishes in a New York jail, awaiting trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in an interview with NBC News on Monday, President Trump said elections were not on the horizon. \"We have to fix the country first,\" he said. \"You can't have an election.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gunson says Washington's decision not to go for regime change in the short term might make sense, but the absence of a medium- or long-term prospect is disappointing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Trump may be getting something out of this, but Venezuelans aren't,\" he says. \"Ordinary Venezuelans are getting screwed as usual.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the Trump administration talking up the prospects of international oil companies re-investing in Venezuela's corrupt and moribund petroleum infrastructure, Gunson says reality may be more complicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody's going to come in here with the tens of billions of dollars that are required…to start the recovery process if the government is illegitimate and there's no rule of law,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the former Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chávez designated Nicolás Maduro as his successor, shortly before his death in 2013, the move was described as Chavez's \"dedazo,\" a Spanish slang term meaning a \"finger pointing,\" a personal anointment which bypasses the normal democratic process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ambassador Shapiro sees a parallel with the rise to power of Delcy Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is Trump's dedazo,\" he says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Denmark, a fellow Nato ally, says an attack on its territory would end the military alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration says Greenland is vital to US security. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US since World War 2.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron that are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change.

Frankly, it was not what I expected. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no screens or keyboards, let alone holographic head cams or brain-reading chips. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow is an oil barrel-sized series of round discs connected by hundreds of black control wires descending into a bronze liquid helium bath refrigerator keeping the Quantum microchip a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It looks, and feels, very eighties, but if quantum's potential is realised, the metal and wire jellyfish structure in front of me will transform the world, in many ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Welcome to our Quantum AI lab,\" says Hartmut Neven, Google's Quantum chief, as we go through the high security door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven is something of a legendary figure, part technological genius, part techno music enthusiast, who dresses like he has snowboarded here straight from the Burning Man music festival – for which he designs art. Perhaps he has, in a parallel universe - more on that later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His mission is to turn theoretical physics into functional quantum computers \"to solve otherwise unsolvable problems\" and he admits he's biased but says these chandeliers are the best performing in the world.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Faisal Islam was shown around a Google facility in Santa Barbara</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Secret temple of high science</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of our conversation is about what we are not allowed to film in this restricted lab. This critical technology is subject to export controls, secrecy and is at the heart of a race for commercial and economic supremacy. Any small advantage, from the shape of new components to the companies in global supply chains, is a source of potential leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a notable Californian vibe in this temple of high science, in its art and colour. Each quantum computer is given a name such as Yakushima or Mendocino, they are each wrapped in a piece of contemporary art, and various graffiti-style murals adorn the walls illuminated by the bright winter sun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven holds up Willow, Google's latest Quantum chip, which has delivered two important milestones. He said it settled \"once and for all\" the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can't. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years, so more than a trillion trillion, or one with 25 zeros on the end, more than the age of the universe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neven reels off the ways he believes this Willow quantum chip will be used \"to help with many problems that humankind has now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently,\" he says. \"It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport energy, to store energy... solve climate change and human hunger...\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us,\" he tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some researchers believe that actual Artificial Intelligence will only be truly possible with Quantum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the team here have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into \"superconducting qubits\" used here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Willow chip has 105 qubits. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04gvx7egw5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Microsoft's quantum effort has 8 qubits</a>, but uses a different approach. The race around the world is to get to 1 million qubits for a \"utility scale machine\" that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error. The technology is fragile.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Companies around the world are racing to make a revolutionary new generation of computers.</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What is going on here is being watched carefully around the world. Professor Sir Peter Knight, Chair of the National Quantum Technology Programmes Strategy Advisory Board, says Willow broke new ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This puts the technology on a path to being scaled towards accurately doing a trillion operations, perhaps within seven or eight years, rather than the two decades previously assumed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the first quarter of this century was defined by the rise of the internet and then Artificial Intelligence, the next 25 years will surely be the start of the Quantum era.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How does it work?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed drawers. A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time. Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops. But the point is that the power of these computers grow exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I ask Nvidia chief Jensen Huang whether this poses a threat to his model of providing the specialised chips for AI. \"No, a quantum processor will be added to a computer in the future,\" he replies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And one of the UK's leaders in the field points out what is up for grabs in the quantum world - the eventual power to decrypt almost anything from state secrets to Bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of cryptocurrency will also have to be re-examined because of the quantum computing threat,\" Sir Peter says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A top partner to Nvidia last year said that while Bitcoin had a few years yet, the technology needed to fork to a stronger blockchain by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tech industry sources refer to the process of \"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later\" to describe how state agencies are believed to be saving all of the worlds encrypted data at home and abroad with the expectation of future generations being able to access it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Global race</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And then there is the race across the world. China's approach is very different to the commercial race in the US and the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At around $15bn (£11bn), the total resource committed to quantum technology in China is possibly of the order of all the rest of the world's government programmes put together, says Sir Peter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2022 China has published more scientific papers on quantum than other countries, the efforts have been led by a pioneering physicist called Pan Jianwei. It is a key part of Beijing's 14th five-year plan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China took a decision to stop its tech companies such as Baidu and Alibaba from developing their own quantum research – and concentrate the people and the infrastructure into a state-run enterprise. China is trying to get the edge on quantum communications and satellites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Pan developed and tested the Zuchongzhi 3.0 quantum computer using similar technology though a different approach to that of Willow, claiming similar results. In the autumn it was opened up for commercial use. It all feels a little like the World War Two Manhattan Project to produce the first nuclear weapons, or the Space Race of the 21st Century.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK is one of the scientific heartlands for quantum research. It was a British scientist who did the original research on superconducting qubits. There are dozens of companies and cutting-edge research here. The government plans to make a significant investment around this in the coming weeks. It is vital for economics, for military use, and for geopolitics. There is a hope that the UK will be the third power in this area.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Parallel universes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at the Willow lab, there are perhaps even more existential questions being posed. Last year Neven suggested that Willow's unprecedented speed supported some conceptions of the existence of a multiverse. Basically this speed could be explained by Willow having tapped into parallel universes for its compute power. Not all scientists bought this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is still a spirited debate,\" he tells me. \"As you have learned in your lab visit, the reason quantum computers are so powerful is that within one clock cycle it can touch two to the 105 combinations simultaneously. It makes you question where are these different things?… There's a version of quantum mechanics to think about - the many worlds formulation - parallel universes or parallel reality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Willow had not proved this, Neven was careful to say, but was \"suggestive that we should take this idea seriously\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the cutting edge of the frontier of the world, of technology, of growth, and the British Government will soon pour hundreds of millions into catching up with Willow and the Chinese. It sounds like science fiction. It is rapidly becoming economic fact.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Beijing was also unhappy over India giving refuge to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78nzwd10d4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Dalai Lama who had fled Tibet</a> after the 1959 uprising.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The month-long war started on 20 October with China attacking India. Beijing said it was \"a self-defence counter-attack\" and accused Delhi of \"aggressively encroaching on Chinese territory and violating Chinese airspace\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time China declared a unilateral ceasefire a month later - pulling back troops and releasing prisoners of war - India had lost about 7,000 soldiers and 38,000 sq km of territory. The two countries were later separated by an ill-defined 3,440km (2,100-mile) <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53062484\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Line of Actual Control</a>, marked in places by rivers, lakes and snowcaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing has said little officially about the war, beyond claiming its troops eliminated all Indian positions in the conflict zones, and has never commented on the battle of Rezang La.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fought at over 16,000ft (4,900m), it was one battle in a wider war China won.

Major Singh, who was among the dead, was posthumously awarded India's highest military honour Param Vir Chakra for his courage and leadership. Twelve other soldiers received gallantry medals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But initially when the survivors told their superiors about their audacious last stand, \"tragically, no-one believed them\", says Kulpreet Yadav, former navy officer and author of the 2021 book Battle of Rezang La.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The morale was low, we had bitterly lost the war, thousands of our soldiers, including a brigadier, were taken by China as prisoners of war.

He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpLvGmPetds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"address to the nation\".</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the world still unwrapping the tariffs \"gift\" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although \"the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced\", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2025/october/english/execsum.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to slow to 3.1% in 2026.</a> A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nbim.no/en/news-and-insights/podcast/2025/kristalina-georgieva-leading-the-imf-navigating-global-crises-and-strengthening-cooperation/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"better than we feared, worse than it needs to be\".</a> Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other forecasts for 2026 are <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.piie.com/newsroom/press-releases/2025/piie-sees-global-economic-growth-slowing-2026-amid-policy-headwinds\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">even more pessimistic</a> than that of the IMF.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF.

which includes two Arctic brigades capable of parachute or helicopter-borne missions - would be the \"primary capability\" in any invasion, \"supported by air force and naval assets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His assessment was echoed by Justin Crump, a British Army reserve officer who heads the risk and intelligence company Sibylline. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US has overwhelming naval power and it has the ability to lift pretty large numbers of troops,\" he said. \"You could easily fly in enough troops to have one for every few members of the population in a single lift.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Crump added this option would be ruthless, but also potentially bloodless with little resistance likely to be offered. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9327/live/2e3c7c50-ebd6-11f0-b725-593cd1ff1d86.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Exterior of Nuuk, Greenland. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">While huge, Greenland is sparsely populated, meaning a military operation could be done quickly</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US, however, several former officials and defence analysts said a military operation was extremely unlikely, given its far-reaching implications for US-European alliances. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That would clearly be against all international law,\" said Mick Mulroy, a former marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy assistant secretary of defence. \"Not only are they no threat to the US, they are a treaty ally.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the White House began moving towards a military option, Mr Mulroy said he believed it would meet resistance from lawmakers who could use the War Powers Act - which is designed to limit the president's ability to make war without Congressional approval - to pre-empt it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think there would be any support in Congress to destroy the Nato alliance,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Buying Greenland </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has deep pockets, but Greenland is not for sale, according to both Nuuk and Copenhagen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Citing a lawmaker and a source familiar with the discussions, CBS - the BBC's US news partner - has reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of Congress that a purchase was the administration's preferred option.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if Greenland wanted to be sold, such a transaction would be highly complicated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any funds would have to be appropriated by Congress, and acquiring Greenland by treaty would require support from two-thirds of the Senate -

Far from a Maduro opponent, Rodríguez was his closest lieutenant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since she was named interim president, police have been patrolling the streets and journalists have been detained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC at a rally calling for the jailed leader's release, Rosa Contreras said the image of Maduro waving after arriving in the US had inspired her to take to the streets to show her continuing support for Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had an attitude that sent us a message: if I'm standing here, you have to stand here, stand tall and keep going,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">'It seems unjust' - Views on Maduro's seizure from Caracas</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marcelo is also pleased that Maduro survived the US assault unscathed - but for different reasons. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We want him to live every single day remaining in his life behind prison bars,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Millions of people have left Venezuela in recent years due to political and economic crisis which has worsened under Maduro. But Marcelo said he had friends outside the country who would return if Maduro's fall led to a change in government and an end to Chavismo - the socialist political movement named after Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chávez.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States runs the country so there's a stable transition in Venezuela economically and socially, I think everyone would be OK with that, even if it's not a perfect solution,\" he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One opposition activist in his 60s from the north-western city of Maracaibo told the BBC that he lamented the loss of life in the US operation, but was happy Maduro had been seized and taken into custody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The man they took away has done a lot of harm. We're glad they have him over there,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Chavismo, a lack of food and medicine had led to much suffering and death, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They gave the people the scraps while keeping the feast for themselves,\" a 33-year-old masseuse told the BBC, referring to Maduro's government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She does not support Acting-President Delcy Rodríguez, but says \"if this is the price we have to pay for a government transition then I accept it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also concern over what might happen next - a common fear for those who spoke to the BBC. US President Donald Trump has not ruled out a second wave of strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gelén Correa, 50, who works in government social programmes, was defiant about the prospect of further military action, however.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The [Venezuelan] people deserve respect. I am prepared to fight back,\" she insisted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Should there be a second ground attack, Correa said the US would find Venezuelans \"armed to the teeth\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a8c9/live/8fd52fc0-eb36-11f0-b17a-592c1458f962.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu via Getty Images Delcy Rodríguez sits on a large chair with her hands clasped in front of her.
