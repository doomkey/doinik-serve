It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

eZyhnA\">There is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he doesn't hide it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Reuters Caps with slogans supporting Greenland placed on a shelf.

forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called

Carney on his trip to China last week.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear

href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgjlqwxevd0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">rose to Canada's highest office last year</a> buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world

My own mind.

Categorically, our position hasn't changed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said it had acted \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They added that the agreement had secured the operations of the joint US-UK military base \"for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out\", and noted the deal had been welcomed by allies including the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Questioned about his position on the deal at the White House later on Tuesday, Trump said: \"When they originally were going to do it they were talking about doing some concept of ownership, but now they're looking to essentially just do a lease and sell it, and I'm against that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chagos Islands are a \"reasonably important area of the globe\", he said, adding: \"I think they should keep it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't know why they're doing it - do they need money?\" Trump added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mauritius' attorney general Gavin Glover said he still expects the agreement to go ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement he said it was \"important to remember\" that the deal was \"negotiated, concluded and signed exclusively between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"The sovereignty of the Republic of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago is already unambiguously recognised by international law and should no longer be subject to debate.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agreement followed a long-running dispute between the UK and Mauritius - a former British colony - about sovereignty over the Chagos Islands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of £101m a year.

The price of silver dipped from a record high above $94 an ounce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the currency markets, the US dollar held steady against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m90jjewd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Liberation Day</a>\" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes at on the continent expected to boost US exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament to become official. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Saturday, within hours of Trump's threat of US tariffs over Greenland, Manfred Weber, an influential German member of European Parliament, said \"approval is not possible at this stage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament's committee on international trade, said there was \"no alternative\" but to suspend the deal because of the threats over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By threatening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of an EU member state and by using tariffs as a coercive instrument, the US undermines the stability and predictability of EU–US trade relations,\" said Lange, whose committee needs to sign off on the deal before it heads to parliament for a final vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decision opens up questions about whether the EU will move forward with threats to retaliate against the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bloc had announced a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods that could be hit with levies last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs before putting the plan on hold, while the two sides finalised details of a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that reprieve ends on 6 February, meaning EU levies will come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves for an extension or approves the new deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron is among those urging the EU to consider its retaliatory options, including the anti-coercion instrument, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington's \"endless accumulation\" of new tariffs is \"fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty,\" he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">American response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also speaking in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his warning to European leaders against retaliation, urging them to \"have an open mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate. The president will be here tomorrow, and he will get his message across,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer warned that the US would not let retaliation go without response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What I've found is that when countries follow my advice, they tend to do okay. When they don't, crazy things happen,\" Greer said, in remarks reported by the Agence France-Presse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjnlm54po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal</a> amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Built with EU funds, it provided a state-of-the-art transport system that was fast, efficient and safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A derailment near Santiago de Compostela in 2013 that killed 80 people was not part of the AVE network, although that train was travelling at high speed. Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA People gather to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the train collision that occurred on 18 January, in Punta Umbria, Huelva, Spain, on 20 January 2026.

Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150-km (93-mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters People sleeping in a metro station in Kyiv\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Around 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue.

In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself. As it stands, Kyiv's European partners are buying missiles from the US on Ukraine's behalf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it comes to [protection from] ballistic missiles, for now the key is in the hands of the United States of the America,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very important that deliveries are timely, that production works, and that partners help us purchase the necessary missiles,\" Zelensky stressed. \"In other words, a great deal in the security of Ukrainians depends on the unity of Europe and America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-liubov-sholudko.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation. Introducing the reforms, Burke said individuals with \"hate in their hearts and guns in their hands\" had carried out the 14 December attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father in the father-son duo allegedly behind the attack legally owned six firearms, while his son had been on the radar of intelligence agencies.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gun reform bill, which cleared the House of Representatives by 96 votes to 45, includes stricter firearm import controls and provisions to improve information sharing between intelligence agencies on people trying to obtain gun licences. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The buyback scheme will target \"surplus and newly restricted firearms\", Burke said, reducing the country's four million registered guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burke added that it \"comes as a shock to most Australians\" to know that the country <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxql12317qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">has more firearms that it did before the 1996 Port Arthur attack</a>, in which a gunman killed 35 people in Tasmania. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That attack, the country's worst mass shooting,<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>had prompted the then government to introduce some of the world's strictest gun controls. The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour. The Greens voted against, saying it would have a \"chilling effect\" on political debate and protest.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They are completely different from the results in the electoral on the polling stations and on the declaration forms,\" Wine told the BBC, speaking from an undisclosed location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities have not responded to his allegations, but the Uganda Human Rights Commission (UHRC) said the \"technical and procedural\" challenges observed on polling day did not undermine the overall fairness of the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their report, the African Union (AU) election observers said they saw \"no evidence of ballot stuffing\", but condemned days-long internet shutdown - which only returned hours after President Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After losing to Museveni in 2021, Wine challenged the results but later withdrew the petition, citing what he called the court's bias and lack of impartiality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wine, who has lost his presidential bid for a second time, also alleged there was an ongoing \"silent massacre\" as political activists were targeted in a crackdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a social media post <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/HEBobiwine/status/2013493504136098085\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">he said more than 100 people had been killed in election violence </a>- without stating evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 100 youths have been remanded in prison on various charges linked to election-related incidents across Kampala, the Daily Monitor newspaper reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/mkainerugaba/status/2013317668497981649\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In a post on X on Monday</a>, Uganda's army chief Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also President Museveni's son and his potential successor, said the security forces had killed 22 opposition supporters during poll-related violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gen Kainerugaba also threatened Wine, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/mkainerugaba/status/2013287572705783880\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">giving him \"exactly 48 hours to surrender himself to the police\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he doesn't we will treat him as an outlaw/rebel and handle him accordingly,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w172zsq26l1mk7g\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In his BBC interview</a>, Wine said he fled his home after learning that security forces were planning to \"attack\" him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They jumped off my fence and cut off my electricity and the surveillance cameras.

He has been released from hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It follows three other attacks in Sydney over the past two days. All beaches in Sydney's northern area will remain closed until further notice, said police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks follow days of heavy rains, which NSW Superintendent Joseph McNulty had earlier said may have created a \"perfect storm environment\" for shark attacks.

When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57303592\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">up to three children</a> per couple in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpk7r8w9yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new 13% tax on contraceptives</a> - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57154574\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">other factors</a> - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The notice was followed soon by a demolition order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The West Bank was split into three categories of territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

Sunday, about an hour after one of the trains departed Málaga for Madrid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The train derailed and crossed over to the opposite track, operator Adif said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It then collided with an oncoming train travelling from south Madrid to Huelva, which was forced into an embankment running alongside the track, Spain's Transport Minister Óscar Puente said on Sunday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of those killed and injured were in the front carriages of the Huelva-bound train, he

investigation has been launched but it is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Puente has described the crash as \"extremely strange\" and said all the railway experts consulted by the government \"are extremely baffled by the accident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president of Spain's state-owned rail operator, Renfe, said he had \"discarded\" the possibility that the incident occured due to excessive speed or human error.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Álvaro Fernández Heredia told Spain's national radio RNE that even if a mistake had been made, a system within the train would have fixed it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that both trains were travelling under the maximum speed limit on the stretch of track where the crash happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fernández Heredia suggested a mechanical fault or an infrastructure issue was a more likely cause.</p><p

Gas was really, really bad and then we had problems with getting food trucked in because I live in a rural area, so prices shot up real crazy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where other people were complaining about $7 (£5.23) eggs, we had $11 (£8.22) eggs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some days it was like deciding whether the dogs ate or I ate. I'm on social security and I have a budget and I'm allowed food stamps, but I only get $24 a month and that doesn't buy a whole lot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's much better now, it's like night and day.

My parents might retire next year, which could help. I work as an engineer in data centres and my wife is an airline pilot, and neither of us want to quit our job to take care of kids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It feels like Trump doesn't tell the truth about almost anything, so it's hard to know how the economy is actually doing. I'd grade him a 4 out of 10 for the economy, because he talks about it more than he actually does anything to help it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shrinkflation drives me crazy.

I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are \"marginally ahead\" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that.

very, very active role in the making of the art masters. Those were the people who sacrificed their lives and time, [and] gave devotion, energy and soul to the mission of Osun Osogbo and Nigeria.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun was one of those people. His actual date of birth appears to be unknown, but he was born around 1945 into the Arelagbayi lineage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wood carving was a family tradition, but by the time of Akangbe Ogun's birth, it had skipped two generations. At the very start of primary school, his education was truncated by his father's death. He eventually started learning carpentry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun reflected later in life: \"I only spent one week in school, but I lecture university students in the US. I am good at picking up languages. I have travelled a lot, and it's all thanks to art.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was working in the grove, on the Iledi Ontooto shrine roof, when Susanne Wenger, the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7595841.stm\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Austrian-Nigerian artist and Yoruba priestess, </a>said to him: \"It is wood carving you'll be doing.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She told him his work was distinctive, different - and he held on to that to the end of his days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Wenger wrote in 1990: \"Akangbe, bodily and spiritually voluminous, creates works of an ethereal, sublimely weightless loftiness. His work is a primary eruption of genius.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dba1/live/d9d36720-f529-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Molara Wood Kasali Akangbe Ogun, dressed in a colourful green outfit, is sitting on the floor and doing a carving\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Molara Wood</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Despite his fame, Kasali Akangbe Ogun led a simple life</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on behalf of the Adunni Olorisha Trust, Akinsanya said the carver's \"craftsmanship is visible in the ritual figures, majestic pillars, and beautifully crafted roofs adorning many of the shrines\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akangbe Ogun exhibited widely, including at: Iwalewa Haus, Bayreuth, Germany (1989); Africa Centre, London (1990); Edinburgh Fringe (1994); and in the New Sacred Art Movement show at Quintessence, Lagos (2009). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He exhibited - and executed commissions - at the National Black Theatre in Harlem in the US, all through the 1990s, working with the theatre's founder, Barbara Ann Teer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the invitation of historian Akinwunmi Ogundiran, the carver was Distinguished Africana Artist-in-Residence at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, US, in 2013.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ogundiran wrote that Akangbe Ogun's works \"transcend the traditional boundaries of sculpture, structural design, folklore, and environmental preservation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his tribute, curator and art consultant Moses Ohiomokhare said: \"I mourn the loss of this great artist, a master wood carver and an extraordinary person.
