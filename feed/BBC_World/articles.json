Even now, as this new Board slowly takes shape, it includes Netanyahu who has vowed to stop the establishment of a Palestinian state, and Arab leaders who insist the only pathway to a sustainable peace must lead to Palestinian self-governance and the end of Israeli occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the other big war on America's - and Europe's agenda - is Ukraine.

Judges concluded that the actions were driven by personal unease and a desire to impose order during night shifts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defendant denied the charges during the trial in Aachen, stating that he had intended to help patients sleep and had not believed the medication posed a lethal risk given their underlying illnesses. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors told the court that he showed \"irritation\" and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing \"master of life and death\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The offences examined in the initial trial occurred between December 2023 and May 2024 at the Rhein-Maas hospital in Würselen, where the nurse had worked since 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The newly identified suspected cases relate largely to earlier periods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the expanded inquiry, investigators have ordered around 60 exhumations. Twenty seven have already been carried out, with roughly 30 more pending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schlenkermann-Pitts said autopsy results were still outstanding in many cases and would determine whether further charges could be brought.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, they may still be dropped,\" she cautioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in Cologne are also examining deaths linked to hospitals where the nurse worked before his transfer to Würselen, 65km (40 miles) away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two exhumations have taken place so far, including the remains of a 94 year old woman who died in 2018, and a 78 year old patient who died in 2015. Further exhumations have been ordered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in both Aachen and Cologne said preparations for potential new charges were under way, but officials said that any further proceedings were unlikely to begin before 2027.</p></div></div></body></html>"

including its long-awaited Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake - as part of a \"major reset\" of its operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French developer and publisher, known for popular games such as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Just Dance, has closed two studios and delayed seven titles as part of its changes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said the move would \"create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The firm's shares plunged by 33% on Thursday morning following the announcement.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move comes at a time when studios are increasingly turning to video game remakes and remasters, with new versions of Super Mario Galaxy, Oblivion and Metal Gear Solid 3 proving popular in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the decision to bin the remake of Sands of Time - which sold millions of copies in 2003 - has left many fans scratching their heads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ubisoft has not specified which titles it has discontinued alongside the Prince of Persia remake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it says among them are four unannounced titles, including three based on new intellectual property, and a mobile game.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ubisoft has closed its studios in Stockholm, Sweden and Halifax, Canada as part of the move, which will include restructuring three others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The developers were working on a new intellectual property (IP) and mobile titles for Assassin's Creed, respectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The closure of Ubisoft Halifax was previously announced in January - the same week the studio formed a union. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"> \"While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organisation over the long term,\" Guillemot said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Taken together, these measures mark a decisive turning point for Ubisoft and reflect our determination to confront challenges head-on to reshape the Group for the long term\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaming industry analyst Piers Harding-Rolls told the BBC the move indicated the firm was trying to mitigate risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's less risky to maintain scale by investing in existing big franchises such as Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six than launch entirely new IPs and that's reflected in the cancellation of a number of games based on new IPs,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Rising development costs'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is the second restructure from Ubisoft in subsequent years, after the firm cut 185 jobs across Europe in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, it <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2jxzjgpplo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">closed its office in Leamington</a> and restructured another in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guillemot said the new move was in part due to a competitive market for triple-A games - blockbuster titles which cost millions to develop and dominate large studios' offerings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On the one hand, the triple-A industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands,\" he said <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in a statement on Wednesday</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such big offerings are increasingly facing delays -

The site had reportedly been dug up a few years ago before work was stalled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mehta, who didn't know how to swim, climbed on to the roof of his car as it began to sink and rang his father who rushed to the scene and alerted the emergency services. His father told reporters that Mehta remained there for close to two hours, flashing the torch on his phone and shouting for help.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, his cries stopped. By the time authorities recovered his body, almost five hours had passed since the accident, local media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mehta's tragic death has made national headlines, and the fact that it happened so close to the capital city has shocked and angered residents. Protests have been held at the accident site, with demonstrators accusing authorities of negligence and demanding accountability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His death has also fuelled larger questions about the state of Indian roads and urban planning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Noida techie's [Mehta's] death is essentially a murder.

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has said the UK will not yet be signing up to US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace over concerns about Russian leader Vladimir Putin's possible participation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper told the BBC the UK had been invited to join the board but \"won't be one of the signatories today\" at a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The board, which gives Trump wide decision-making powers as chairman, is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper described the board as a \"legal treaty that raises much broader issues\" than the initiative's initial focus on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charter proposed by the White House does not mention the Palestinian territory and critics say the board appears to be designed to replace some functions of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the US's traditional allies have not agreed to join the board and notably, none of the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - China, France, Russia, and the UK - have committed to participation so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN Security Council has been the main international platform for global diplomacy and conflict resolution since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But launching the board at a signing ceremony alongside world leaders in Davos, Trump said he did not intend it as a replacement for the UN and expressed his belief that it would help forge an \"everlasting\" peace in the Middle East.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said the board had the chance to be \"one of the most consequential bodies ever created\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be a great plan and this is where the board of peace started.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said once the board had been completely formed, \"we can do pretty much whatever we want to do\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump was joined by the leaders and representatives of 19 countries for the Board of Peace signing ceremony, including Argentina, Hungary, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump also said Putin had accepted an invitation to join the initiative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Russian president has not confirmed this and earlier he said his country was still studying the invitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said the idea of using Russian assets frozen in the US as a contribution to the board would be discussed at a meeting with representatives of the Trump administration later on Thursday, according to Russian state news agency TASS.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC's Breakfast programme from Davos, Cooper said the UK had received an invitation to join the board and strongly supported Trump's 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why we are also clear we want to play our part in phase two of the Gaza peace process,\" Cooper said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she added: \"We won't be one of the signatories today because this is a legal treaty that raises much broader issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something that's talking about peace when we've still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be commitment to peace in Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said Putin had shown no willingness \"to come and make that agreement and that's where the pressure needs to be now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we will have continuing international discussions including with our allies,\" the foreign secretary said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0

eZyhnA\">Diplomatic relations between the US and the UK are on shakier ground after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on European nations if his demand to hand control of Greenland to his country was not met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump appears to have backed down, saying the US was exploring a potential deal on Greenland after talks with the Nato security alliance, as he dropped planned tariffs on eight European countries and ruled out using force to take the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooper welcomed the apparent climbdown on Greenland and said the UK and its European allies had put forward \"positive, constructive proposals\" on security in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when asked about the Board of Peace, Cooper echoed other UK cabinet ministers who in recent days have been expressing concerns over Putin's potential role in the scheme, given Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has been one of Ukraine's staunchest allies and together with France, signed a declaration of intent on deploying troops to the country if a peace deal is made with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's Board of Peace was originally unveiled by the White House as part of a plan to rebuild Gaza and design its future governance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the leaked text of the board's founding charter goes far beyond that purpose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The text says the board would be \"an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaked document says the Board of Peace's charter will enter into force once three states formally agree to be bound by it, with member states given renewable three-year terms and permanent seats available to those contributing $1bn (£740m), it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charter declared the body as an international organisation mandated to carry out peace-building functions under international law, with Trump serving as chairman - and separately as the US representative - and holding authority to appoint executive board members and create or dissolve subsidiary bodies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Friday, the White House named seven members of the founding Executive Board, including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More have now said they will join it, including Pakistan, Egypt and Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Vatican has said the Pope has also received an invitation.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

They provided no other details except that the group includes \"at least one young girl\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The landslides were triggered by heavy rains over the last few days, which led to flooding and power outages across the North Island.

But it has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I heard this huge tree crack and all this dirt come off, and then I looked behind me and there's this huge landslide coming down,\" Australian tourist Sonny Worrall told local broadcaster TVNZ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm still shaking from it now...

We could hear people screaming: 'Help us, help us, get us out of here',\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those calls persisted for about half an hour and then went silent, Tangney said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5e03/live/6c832750-f759-11f0-aff3-fb80c79e9828.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"TVNZ Rescuers comb through crushed caravans and flattened tents at the campsite, with orange cones lining it\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">TVNZ</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Rescue work will continue through the night, officials say </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A surf club in another part of Mount Maunganui has been evacuated following fears of more landslides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A state of emergency has been declared in the Bay of Plenty where Mount Maunganui sits, and various parts of the North Island, including Northland, Coromandel, Tairāwhiti and Hauraki.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several areas reported their wettest days on record on Thursday.

Many have not returned despite assurances it is now safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the suspension of reactor number six on Thursday, Kobayashi said it was \"stable and there is no radioactive impact outside\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reactor was initially set to start on Tuesday, but was pushed back due to a technical issue. It is due to begin operating commercially next month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kobayashi said Tepco was \"currently investigating the cause\" of the incident and did not say when operations would resume. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seventh reactor at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is not expected to be turned back on until 2030, while the other five could be decommissioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This would leave the plant with far less capacity than it once had when all seven reactors were operational.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reactor number six was given the green light to restart despite safety concerns from local residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A small crowd of people gathered outside Tepco's headquarters to protest last week, while hundreds gathered outside the Niigata prefectural assembly in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan was an early adopter of nuclear power - before 2011, nuclear accounted for nearly 30% of its electricity and the country planned to get that up to 50% by 2030.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After it was forced to shut them all down in the wake of the Fukushima disaster, it has spent the past decade attempting to revive the plants as part of its goal to reach net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2015, Japan has restarted 15 out of its 33 operable reactors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"an-earlier-version-of-this-story-said-the-kashiwazaki-kariwa-nuclear-plant-was-in-tokyo-and-has-been-corrected-to-say-it-is-north-west-of-tokyo.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">An earlier version of this story said the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant was in Tokyo and has been corrected to say it is north-west of Tokyo.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

400 - falls far short of what they have been able to confirm. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NGO Foro Penal says it has so far only been able to verify the release of 151 political prisoners since 8 January, when the head of Venezuela's National Assembly announced that \"an important number of people\" would be freed as \"a gesture of peace\" following the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Foro Penal has also said that many those released have not had the charges against them dropped, leaving them in legal limbo, and have been barred from speaking in public. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tudares's imprisonment was one of the emblematic cases of the repression which followed in the wake of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father-in-law, González, became the main challenger of the incumbent Maduro after the well-known opposition leader María Corina Machado was barred from running.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fearing the Maduro government would resort to fraud to rig the result, González and Machado mobilised hundreds of people to act as observers at the polling stations and collect the tallies from the electronic voting machines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The electoral council, dominated by government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner but never provided the detailed voting tallies to back up its claim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The voting tallies collected by the observers deployed by the opposition and independently verified by the Carter Center, however, suggested that González had won by a landslide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, Maduro - who was firmly in control of the state institutions, including the armed forces and the police - was sworn in for another term in January 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the run-up to his inauguration, many opposition leaders and activists were seized by the security forces in an attempt to stifle any dissent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fearing arrest, González had sought refuge in the Dutch embassy as early as September 2024 and gone in to exile in Spain shortly afterwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three days before Maduro's inauguration, González's 46-year-old son-in-law - a lawyer who was not involved in politics - was seized by hooded men as he was taking his young children to see their ailing grandmother. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For months, his family did not know where he was being held or on what grounds he had been seized.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, his wife said she had learned that he had been sentenced to 30 years in prison for \"terrorism and conspiracy\". She said her access was not allowed to choose a lawyer and had only been allowed to read the charges levelled against him on the day of his \"only hearing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariana González told El Pais newspaper that she had been approached on at least three occasions by middlemen who told her that her husband would only be allowed to return to his family if her father renounced his cause. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This has nothing to do with justice,\" she said at the time. \"Being the son-in-law of Edmundo González is not a crime,\" she added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariana González took to X to thank all of the people who had supported her in her fight for her husband's release. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she also reminded readers that there were still many families waiting for the release of their loved ones who, she said, had been \"forcibly disappeared, arbitrarily detained and unjustly locked up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of them have been holding vigils outside the main prisons in Venezuela in the hope that their relatives will be among those released in the wake of the US military raid.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes on the continent expected to boost US exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal would have still required approval from the European Parliament to become official. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Wednesday, days after Trump threatened fresh US tariffs over Greenland, Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's International Trade Committee, said it was \"left with no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said work to implement the trade plans would be on hold \"until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move renewed the possibility that the EU might move forward with tariffs on a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods it announced last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It had put those plans on hold while the trade deal was being finalised but those levies would now come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves to extend the pause or approves the new deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lange, speaking before Trump announced the \"framework deal\" and backed off the tariff threat,  said there would be \"no possibility for compromise\" until Trump's threats ended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also raised the prospect of the use of the \"anti-coercion instrument\" of retaliatory measures, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\", an idea also backed by French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC after Trump's announcement, Lange declined to say whether it could salvage the trade deal, adding that it would take \"some time\" to understand its implications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to look what this so-called solution would mean,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There seems to be a sense in Brussels that Trump's climbdown was inevitable. When BBC News asked one well placed EU source for a response to President Trump saying he wouldn't go ahead with the tariffs, the response was simply an eye-rolling emoji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the last year, financial markets have batted away concerns over the impact of the US president's policy announcements, taking comfort in the TACO acronym, Trump Always Chickens Out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the sense of him not following through on threats has also taken hold in some corridors of power.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his interest in the US acquiring Greenland from Denmark, but said \"I don't have to use force, I don't want to use force, I won't use force\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He called for \"immediate negotiations\" with the country about how he could take over the island, which he has argued is crucial for US and global security, announcing the \"framework\" of a future deal a few hours later.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's speech helped to calm financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic, which had sunk in previous days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in the US gained further on the deal announcement, with the Dow Jones, S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq, rising more than 1% in afternoon trading on Wednesday, while the FTSE 100 closed slightly higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,842 (£3,604) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver remained slightly lower than Monday's record high of $95 an ounce, hovering around $94.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjnlm54po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal</a> amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But ahead of Trump's arrival in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said European leaders should not jump to retaliate, urging them to \"have an open mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former intelligence official Egisto Ott has gone on trial in Vienna, accused of spying for Russia in what is being dubbed Austria's biggest spy trial in years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egisto Ott, who told the court on Thursday that he was not guilty, is charged with having handed over information to Russian intelligence officers and to Jan Marsalek, the fugitive executive of collapsed German payments firm Wirecard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor told the court that Ott, 63, was \"not romantic about Russia\" but had acted out of financial motives and frustration with his career. \"Simply put, this was betraying the country.\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ott's lawyer, Anna Mair, rejected the allegations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Don't you think that if he had really been spying for Russia, he would have covered his tracks?\" she asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutor argued that people like Ott were \"very susceptible\" to working for the Russians, saying: \"They are frustrated in their careers and urgently need money.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ott had done \"excellent\" work for the Russian secret service\", the prosecution added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former intelligence official had been broke since 2013 at the latest, the court heard: \"The Russian secret service pays very well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is alleged to have \"abused his authority\" as an Austrian intelligence official by collecting large amounts of personal data, such as locations, vehicle registration numbers, or travel movements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors say he did this between 2015 and 2020 without authorisation, often using national and international police databases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also accuse him of supporting \"a secret intelligence service of the Russian Federation to the detriment of the Republic of Austria\" by collecting secret facts and a large amount of personal data from police databases between 2017 and 2021.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The spy scandal has revived fears that Austria remains a hotbed of Russian espionage activity and observers will also be watching closely for details that could emerge about Jan Marsalek.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marsalek, who is also an Austrian citizen, is wanted by German police for alleged fraud and is currently believed to be in Moscow, having fled via Austria in 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The subject of an Interpol Red Notice, he is alleged to be an intelligence asset for the FSB, Russia's secretive security service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors allege that Egisto Ott handed information to Marsalek and unknown representatives of the Russian intelligence service, and received payment in return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, they say, Marsalek commissioned him to obtain a laptop containing secret electronic security hardware used by EU states for secure electronic communication. The laptop, they say, was handed over to the Russian intelligence service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egisto Ott is also suspected, reports say, of having passed phone data from senior Austrian interior ministry officials to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Austria's Standard newspaper says Egisto Ott apparently obtained the work phones after they accidentally fell into the River Danube on an interior ministry boating trip. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is alleged to have copied their contents and passed them on to Jan Marsalek, and Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egisto Ott is charged with abuse of authority and corruption and espionage against Austria and faces up to five years in prison, if he is found guilty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he was arrested in 2024, Austria's then Chancellor, Karl Nehammer, described the case as \"a threat to democracy and our country's national security\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/593d/live/b326ff70-f6e0-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Munich Police Munich police wanted poster for Jan Marsalek\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Munich Police</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jan Marsalek, former executive at Wirecard, is believed to have escaped to Moscow</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a separate development, prosecutors in the Austrian town of Wiener Neustadt have told the BBC that a former MP, Thomas Schellenbacher, has been charged with helping Marsalek to escape following the collapse of the Wirecard company in 2020, when it emerged that €1.9bn (£1.7bn) was missing from its accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schellenbacher is alleged to have helped Jan Marsalek fly to Belarus, from Bad Vöslau in Austria, in June 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schellenbacher was an MP for the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), which has been accused by Austria's Green Party, now in opposition, of enabling Russian espionage, of acting as \"an extension of Russia's arm\" in Austria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FPÖ and its leader Herbert Kickl have denied the allegations - and have not faced any legal action in connection with any of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marsalek, who was the Wirecard's Chief Operating Officer, has since been charged with fraud and embezzlement, suspected of having inflated company's balance sheet total and sales volume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is also believed to have been the controller of a group of Bulgarians who were convicted in London in 2025, of spying for Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Messages from that trial reveal Marsalek has had plastic surgery to alter his appearance as well as details of his life as a fugitive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm off to bed.

They are understood to have been working for an Egyptian relief organisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said it struck \"several suspects who operated a drone affiliated with Hamas... in a manner that posed a threat\" to its troops. It added that the incident was under examination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another eight people, two of them children, were killed by Israeli artillery and gunfire across Gaza on Wednesday, the Hamas-run health ministry said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medics said three people, including a 10-year-old boy, were killed by Israeli tank fire elsewhere in central Gaza, and that a 13-year-old boy and a woman were killed by Israeli gunfire in the southern Khan Younis area, according to Reuters news agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said on Wednesday morning that its troops had killed a \"terrorist who crossed the Yellow Line and approached\" them, without mentioning a location.

Something about their total lack of interest allowed him to shed the idea that the studio recording has to capture \"the perfect, definitive version\" of a song.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result, Pulp's contribution to Help(2) is called Begging For Change - and it has a loose, live band feeling that exemplifies the album's spontaneity and sense of community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, the youthful camera crew even made it onto the record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's an interesting thing, you know, because kids are always told, 'Shut up, because I'm trying to think', or, 'Shhh, your dad's hungover',\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So when they're given the chance to make a noise, they will do that.

Thanks to record labels and pressing plants donating their services free of charge, it will be cheaper than standard albums - with a double vinyl costing around £26 - and Warchild receiving all the profits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We found that this project really lit a fire under the creative community, \" says Rich Clarke, the charity's head of music. \"Lots of people wanted to get involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He lets slip that the 23 tracks on the album weren't the only product of the week-long recording sessions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a there's a whole load of tracks, around 10 or so, that that came in when people heard about the project. So actually, there were some tough decisions for the team about what made it onto the record.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Olivia Rodrigo's song - about the purity of love - was always earmarked as the closing track.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a really beautiful cover,\" says Clarke. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The record really takes you through a journey, with some powerful themes around conflict, but Olivia leaves you with a track about the redemptive power of love, which is a really poignant final note\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

What happens next will be a test for a government that has tried to assert its authority over the whole country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gains by government forces in a lightning offensive against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) marked the biggest change of control in Syria since Islamist-led rebels toppled Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, ending the 13-year civil war. Before this month's push, nearly a third of Syria's territory was controlled by the Kurds, who enjoyed American support after helping a US-led coalition defeat the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in the last decade. There, they ran an enclave with its own government and institutions, with the SDF being its military arm.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0490/live/acef4fb0-f77e-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa holds up a 14-point agreement with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), giving the government control over Kurdish-run north-eastern Syria, in Damascus, Syria (18 January 2026)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Ahmed al-Sharaa signed a 14-point agreement with the SDF on Sunday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The offensive came amid stalled talks between Sharaa's government and the SDF about the key issue of integrating its forces into the country's institutions. A deal was signed last March, but a year-end deadline expired with little progress as the SDF remained reluctant to give up its autonomy. The militia alliance, analysts say, miscalculated in its negotiations with the government, seeming to believe it would have the backing of its longtime ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the US under President Donald Trump has strongly supported Sharaa, who has defended his vision of a united Syria under the control of Damascus. Trump hosted Sharaa, who was once branded a terrorist by the US for his former links to al-Qaeda, at the White House last year, and lifted devastating sanctions imposed on Syria in the Assad years. When Sharaa's forces started their push, there was no apparent US objection.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4634/live/1d184610-f780-11f0-a454-dd9f56c864fe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP A woman holds a rifle at a protest by Kurds against a government offensive in north-eastern Syria, in Qamishli, Syria (20 January 2026 \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Syrian Kurds stand to lose the autonomy they enjoyed for more than a decade </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, after suffering stunning<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>territorial losses, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://sana.sy/en/syria/2291194/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the SDF agreed on a 14-point deal</a> that reversed almost all concessions it had gained from the government in earlier negotiations.

SDF-run prisons and camps holding thousands of IS detainees and family members are also being brought under Damascus' control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement came days after Sharaa issued a decree that was seen as an attempt to reach out to the Kurds, whose rights had been denied in the five-decade rule by the Assads: it designated Kurdish as a national language, granted Syrian nationality to stateless Kurds, and declared the Nowruz - the Persian new year - a national holiday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fighting, however, erupted again. So far, the areas reclaimed by government forces have been mainly Arab, where locals had resentments against the SDF.

But the country has seen deadly bouts of sectarian violence. Last year, government forces were accused of atrocities after being sent to the Mediterranean coast, which is the heartland of Assad's Alawite sect, and the mainly Druze southern province of Suweida. Kurds fear the same could happen to them, despite renewed guarantees offered by Sharaa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the Kurds, the losses are a fatal blow to the aspirations of preserving their autonomy, with the US position being seen as a betrayal. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy, said the \"original purpose\" of the partnership with the SDF, as the main anti-IS force in Syria, had \"largely expired\", and that the \"greatest opportunity for the Kurds in Syria\" lay in the transition under Sharaa, whose government is seen by Western countries as the best chance to guarantee Syria's stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The dramatic changes empower Sharaa but are likely to renew calls for him to decentralise authority, with critics saying key posts have been limited to his allies. It could also indicate what he may be planning to do in other areas of the country, including those held by the Druze, who demand autonomy.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

tool for him, became largely useless. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have a phone, but there is nothing to do with it,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could no longer research stories, follow election developments or send material to his newsroom. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says everyday life transformed into anxious stretches of waiting for the internet to be restored. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some households reverted to watching television to keep themselves occupied, either watching live, or buying downloaded old movies from shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People bought what they could afford, went back home and just watched, because there were no other options,\" Ngabo says.</p></div><p

difficult to cope. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ronnie Mwesigwa, 20, says he lost contact with friends and had no access to online entertainment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't communicate with anyone, and even gaming was gone,\" he says. \"It was not a good situation.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To pass his time, the gamer turned to content already stored on his phone, only viewing his gallery. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was all I could do.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ngabo explains that the situation was especially frustrating for journalists covering the election, as the blackout made it impossible to get a real picture of what was unfolding on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are talking about people rioting, about tension on the streets, but the audience is only seeing your photo and hearing your voice, and it is not satisfying for the journalist or the viewer,\" he points out. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Yoweri Museveni, 81, won the vote by a landslide to extend his 40-year-rule and has accused the opposition of seeking to overturn the results through violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine, his closest challenger maintains the results are \"fake\" and has cited \"ballot stuffing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a report by the African Union (AU) election observation mission, \"the internet shutdown limited access to information, freedom of association [and] curtailed economic activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also notes that the shutdown \"created suspicion and mistrust\" in the election process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ngabo says that the situation was worse in rural areas. With no internet access, some journalists were forced to physically transport their footage back to their newsrooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He gives an example of videos, made early on the morning of the elections in a remote rural area, reaching Kampala by bus in the evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By that time, results are already being discussed and tallied and nobody is interested in the footage any more,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Caroline Mutai, a Kenya-based journalist who went to Uganda to cover the elections, says the shutdown \"almost gave me depression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She describes the difficulties she faced trying to send back material to her newsroom, spending days searching for places with internet, only to be blocked or chased away. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shutdown also cut her off from family at a time of heightened insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you are tired and stressed after work, you want to talk to people who are close to you,\" she says. \"But you cannot reach them, and that makes the situation even harder.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aaron Benitez says he could not study</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For students, the blackout disrupted both communication and learning. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aaron Benitez, a final-year school pupil, says he was unable to contact his family during a period of uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I needed to know what was happening with my family and what was going on in the country,\" he tells the BBC. \"But I could not connect with them at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Online learning also came to a halt. Teachers could not send notes or assignments, and group discussions normally held online were cancelled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our master could not send notes on WhatsApp,\" the student says. \"We usually study online, sometimes on Zoom, but during that time everything just stopped.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that access remains slow and unreliable, despite the election being over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is back, but it is still very slow. Some materials cannot load properly, and that affects our studies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government partially restored the internet after Museveni was declared the winner on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some platforms, especially social media, remain slow or restricted, pushing many young people to reconnect using a VPN (virtual private network), which can disguise  its online location. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the shutdown was not just a temporary inconvenience but a stark reminder of how deeply digital access shapes their everyday life.</p></div><figure></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
