Prize medal to President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House, saying it was a recognition of his commitment to her country's freedom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think today is a historic day for us Venezuelans,\" she said after meeting Trump in person for the first time, weeks after US forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas and charged him in a drug-trafficking case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump expressed his gratitude in a social media post, saying the move was \"a wonderful gesture of mutual respect\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US president has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, despite her movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has instead been dealing with the acting head of state in Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he said meeting Machado was a \"great honor\", calling her a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After leaving the White House, Machado spoke to supporters gathered at the gates outside, telling them in Spanish, according to the Associated Press: \"We can count on President Trump.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Machado later told journalists in English, calling it \"a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump, who often speaks about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, had expressed displeasure when it was given to Machado and she decided to accept the honour last year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado said last week that she would share it with Trump, but the Nobel Committee later clarified that it was not transferable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others,\" the committee said in a statement last week. \"The decision is final and stands for all time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked for a reaction to Machado's remarks, the committee directed the BBC to their previous statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the White House meeting on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Center posted on X that \"a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her remarks, Machado described how the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought in America's Revolutionary War, gave a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar, one of the founding fathers of modern Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gift was \"a sign of the brotherhood\" between her country and the US \"in their fight for freedom against tyranny,\" Machado said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And 200 years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal - in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize - as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom,\" she said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting \"María, presidente\" and waving Venezuelan flags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had been expected to use her time with Trump to try to persuade him that backing Rodríguez's interim government was a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters as the meeting was underway on Thursday that Machado is \"a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela\" and that Trump \"was looking forward to this meeting and expecting a frank and positive discussion\" about the current realities of life in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously described Machado as a \"freedom fighter\", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Maduro was seized on 3 January, the Trump administration has moved quickly to remake Venezuela's oil sector, which had been under US sanctions. On Wednesday an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oil tankers suspected of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan oil have also been seized by the US, with US forces saying they had boarded <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qdnj5vl9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a sixth tanker on Thursday</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling,\" she said, calling on the country to \"not be afraid of diplomacy\" with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as \"a terrific person\".  Rodríguez, meanwhile, described the call as \"productive and courteous\" and characterised by \"mutual respect.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861yyqxg4do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a decisive victory</a> . </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-koh-ewe\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Koh Ewe</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman wipes her tears while hugging a young girl, as a picture of a soldier can be seen in the background\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in Venezuela</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has been told about a<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>woman<b id=\"-\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> -</b> who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The woman<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Series of deadly incidents around the Yellow Line</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e97kl240lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">had been gathering firewood for their disabled father</a> when they were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times \"beyond the Yellow Line\" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Demolitions and fortification</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction \"may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, the US said the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjw1nxe5pvlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin</a>, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the \"demilitarisation\" of Hamas under October's ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Krieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a \"sterilised belt\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-maha-el-gaml.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Maha El Gaml. </i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

and what that means for sea-level rise.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w15nggj58o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a warming climate</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study is published in the academic journal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady2532\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Science</a>.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

All three Venezuelans were arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,\" said DHS Secretary Kristi Noem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said the officer was \"ambushed and attacked\" by the men and fired a defensive shot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several vehicles belonging to the federal government were damaged in the disorder, and property was stolen from inside the vehicles, according to the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FBI said on Thursday that it was offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the \"recovery of stolen government property and/or the arrest of individuals responsible for the destruction and theft of government property\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 3,000 federal officers have been deployed to Minnesota in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who has demanded ICE leave the city, said on X on Wednesday: \"No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we are seeing in our city is not sustainable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, made a direct appeal to the president on Thursday posting on X: \"Let's turn the temperature down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walz, who has previously called ICE a \"modern-day Gestapo\", told Minnesotans: \"We cannot fan the flames of chaos.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Democratic governor, who ran for US vice-president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, said earlier this month he would end his bid for re-election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move came in the wake of a fraud scandal involving the state's welfare programmes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said Operation Metro Surge will continue in Minnesota after a federal judge on Wednesday denied Minnesota prosecutors a temporary restraining order against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions over immigration enforcement have been running high in the city since the fatal shooting on 7 January of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an ICE agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration says the ICE agent acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman posed no danger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is in the middle of the street.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Good attempts to drive off, one of them at the front of the vehicle points his gun at the driver and fires three shots.

But a Greek coast guard officer, Stavros Gagarellis, gave evidence that the volunteers had cooperated closely with his organisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The judge ruled that \"a communication group on the internet cannot be regarded as a criminal organisation,\" saying: \"Waiting to rescue a human life cannot be considered facilitation of illegal entry. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"None of the defendants attempted to act in such a way as to allow any of the transported persons - refugees or otherwise - to evade inspection by the authorities,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer for Sara Mardini and another defendant, Sean Binder, said after the verdict: \"I'm astonished that it took 2,889 days for the prosecutor to realise that the accusation made no sense whatsoever—something everyone except him already knew.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Binder, an Irish-German lawyer who, alongside Mardini, was held in pre-trial detention for three months in 2018, said: \"Right now it's a relief and anger cocktail, equally balanced. I am obviously very relieved that I'm not going back to prison. But I'm also very angry that it's taken this long to get here.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Binder, now 31, has also spoken of how the allegations had affected his life: \"I've spent the past seven years in limbo. I had hoped to have a job, a career, some savings by now. I'd have hoped to be able to be a father.  I'm trained as a lawyer, but I wasn't allowed to represent my clients until I was acquitted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eve Geddie of the human rights organisation Amnesty International said: \"We hope today's decision sends a strong signal to Greece and other European countries that solidarity, compassion and defending human rights should be protected and celebrated, not punished.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='a-bbc-radio-documentary-on-the-case,-\"assignment:-greece-rescuers-on-trial\"-will-be-broadcast-on-bbc-world-service-on-tuesday,-january-20,-and-will-available-on-bbc-sounds.' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">A BBC radio documentary on the case, \"Assignment: Greece-Rescuers on Trial\" will be broadcast on BBC World Service on Tuesday, January 20, and will available on BBC Sounds.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A series of harrowing cases of allegations of medical negligence, including the death of novelist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son, has ignited a fierce debate about patient safety and systemic failures within Nigeria's healthcare system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family of the internationally acclaimed author says her young son, Nkanu Nnamdi, died last week at a private hospital in the main city, Lagos, following a short illness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They allege the child was denied oxygen and excessively sedated, leading to cardiac arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hospital extended its \"deepest sympathies\" but in a statement denied any wrongdoing, stating its treatment met international standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lagos State Government has ordered an investigation into the death, as public outrage spread over the state of healthcare in Africa's most populous country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just days later, anger surged once more after the death of Aisha Umar, a mother of five who ran a business from home, selling incense and fish in the northern city of Kano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her family alleges a pair of surgical scissors was left inside her abdomen during an operation in September at the state-run Abubakar Imam Urology Centre, leading to four months of severe pain and her eventual death. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For four months, they only gave her pain relievers,\" her brother-in-law, Abubakar Mohammed, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Scans finally showed the scissors were inside her,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family says they plan to sue the facility for negligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kano State Hospitals Management Board said it had \"suspended three personnel directly involved in the case from clinical activities with immediate effect\", and has referred the case for further investigation and disciplinary action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Board reassures the public that it will not condone negligence in any form and will continue to take decisive actions to safeguard the lives, dignity, and trust of patients across all state health facilities,\" a spokesman added in a statement issued on 13 January.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

</b>Lagos-based<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>products manager Josephine Obi, 29, recounted how her father died in 2021 at the state-run Lagos University Teaching Hospital after what she says was a surgical error during a routine procedure for a goitre - a lump or swelling at the front of the neck caused by a swollen thyroid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They cut a major artery... it was a very minor surgery,\" Obi told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said a supervising doctor apologised, admitting a mistake had been made. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family chose not to sue to avoid a potentially costly and protracted legal battle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You will just waste money and the case will linger... we just let it go,\" Obi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC sent an email to the hospital seeking comment, but has not yet received a response. The BBC also phoned the numbers listed on the hospital's website, but they failed to go through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Kano, prison facility officer Abdullahi Umar is still mourning his wife, Ummu Kulthum Tukur, who died three years ago at the age of 27 after giving birth to twins at the state-run Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He believes a timely Caesarean section would have saved her life. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was in labour for over 24 hours... she lost a lot of blood and died,\" he said, adding that the hospital still refuses to provide a death certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Efforts to get the hospital to respond were unsuccessful as the spokesperson Hauwa Inuwa told the BBC she was on leave, instead sending the number of another member of staff, which did not work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joe Abah, a former boss of Nigeria's Bureau of Public Service Reforms, claimed on social media platform X how a private hospital in the capital, Abuja, urged him to undergo immediate surgery for an ailment. Unconvinced, he sought further opinions, including consultations abroad, which concluded no surgery was necessary, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Complaints about treatment in Nigeria's private hospitals are rare, although that is where Adichie's son was treated. They generally have a better reputation than government-owned hospitals, but only a minority can afford to go to them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Private hospitals are out of the reach of many Nigerians because they are expensive but without doubt offer better care compared to government-owned hospitals which carry more load and have manpower and equipment issues,\" Dr Fatima Gaya, who works at a public hospital, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many wealthy Nigerians also go abroad for treatment, including President Bola Tinubu and his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, who died in a clinic in London in 2025 after he stepped down from office.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images Health officials go house to house to immunize children at Agboyi Ori Omi in Agboyi-Ketu, Lagos, Nigeria, on 11 November 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most Nigerians are forced to rely on state health care</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Mohammad Usman Suleiman, president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (Nard), told the BBC that the issues were \"systemic\" and that blaming individuals without addressing the wider problems, such as a lack of doctors and equipment, was futile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Clinical governance needs to be stepped up. In Nigeria, what we have is individuals being blamed for a systemic problem,\" Suleiman told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you take six to seven surgeries... eventually, you are exhausted. No doctor wakes up wanting to harm someone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These concerns are supported by data. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two separate surveys last year - from the African Research Journal of Medical Sciences and NOIPolls - found that around 43% of Nigerians had personally experienced or witnessed a medical error or near-miss. About a third of patients experienced additional injuries from treatment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medics and analysts say Nigeria has a very low doctor-patient ratio, worsened by a massive \"brain drain\" as health professionals emigrate after being enticed by better working conditions abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Remaining health workers sometimes juggle multiple jobs and often go on strike to demand higher salaries, and improved conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says about 15,000 doctors have left the country in the past five years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thenigerialawyer.com/nma-raises-alarm-nigerias-doctor-patient-ratio-soars-to-18000-as-emigration-continues/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Its president, Dr Bala Audu, estimates the ratio is now one doctor to 8,000 patients, far lower than the recommended rate of 1: 600.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An imbalance of over 8,000 patients to one doctor increases overload and stress, which leads to mistakes,\" public affairs analyst Ibrahim Saidu told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's health system is buckling under these pressures, Saidu added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chronic underfunding sees the federal government allocate only about 5% of its budget to health, far below the 15% target set in 2001 by the African Union to improve medical services across the continent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent cases have only amplified calls for urgent reform of Nigeria's health sector to prevent other patients from becoming tragic symbols of a national crisis.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Human rights groups said their convictions came after torture-tainted \"confessions\" and grossly unfair trials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,453 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 14 children, 156 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 14 uninvolved civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran Human Rights says it has so far verified the killing of at least 3,428 protesters by security forces and estimates that around 20,000 people have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's Foreign Minister, Anita Anand, said on Thursday that a Canadian citizen had \"died in Iran at the hands of Iranian authorities\", without identifying them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Peaceful protests by the Iranian people - asking that their voices be heard in the face of the Iranian regime's repression and ongoing human rights violations - have led the regime to flagrantly disregard human life,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies also said a staff member of the Iranian Red Crescent, Amir Ali Latifi, had been killed and five of his colleagues wounded \"in the line of duty in Gilan province\" on 10 January.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Fifteen people died as a result, including three crew and 12 on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/DCA26MA024%20Investigative%20Update.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">update report</a>, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) revealed that cracks found in the engine mounting assembly had previously occurred on several other aircraft.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time the manufacturer responsible for the aircraft, Boeing, concluded that the issue \"would not result in a safety of flight condition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The MD-11 is a relatively elderly design that was originally produced by McDonnell Douglas.  Boeing acquired the company in 1997.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last MD-11 came off the production line in 2001, but Boeing has continued providing parts and service support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the aftermath of the Kentucky disaster, the NTSB issued a preliminary report which drew attention to cracks in the engine attachment mechanism. Its latest update goes further, describing fractures due to evidence of \"fatigue\" – or repeated stresses - in a critical bearing, as well as the mounting it is meant to sit in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It points out that Boeing had previously found failures of the same part on four occasions, affecting three different aircraft. In 2011, the company sent a \"service letter\" to operators warning them of its findings. This is a non legally-binding document used to alert operators about important safety or maintenance information.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this case, Boeing recommended that the part be included in a general visual inspection every five years. It also pointed out changes to the inspection procedure contained in the aircraft maintenance manual, and drew attention to a revised bearing assembly that could be fitted – although this was not mandatory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tim Atkinson, a former air accident investigator who now works as an aviation safety consultant, said the NTSB's update made disturbing reading.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The structure concerned is not decorative, it's an essential part of the mechanism that attaches the engine to the wing, and carries loads such as thrust and drag,\" he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's extraordinary that Boeing concluded that a failure of this part would not have safety consequences,\" he claimed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boeing's internal processes have come under fire on a number of occasions in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Criticisms have focused on how the design of its 737 Max included flawed software that was implicated in two accidents, in 2018 and 2019, that together cost 346 lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quality controls in its factories have also come under scrutiny, after a door panel fell off a brand new 737 Max shortly after take-off in early 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Boeing said: \"We continue to support the investigation led by the NTSB. Our deepest condolences go out to the families who lost loved ones and our thoughts remain with all those affected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NTSB's investigation is continuing. It has not yet issued any firm conclusions about the cause of the accident, and is unlikely to do so until it publishes its final report.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Although he did not rule out the use of force, he said late on Wednesday that he thought something could be worked out with Denmark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is there's not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there's everything we can do.

shot dead a woman last week, sparking protests that spread to other US cities.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday night, clashes broke out between protesters and law enforcement in the Hawthorne area of Minneapolis, near the scene of the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">City police chief Brian O'Hara said his officers were hit by fireworks, ice and snowballs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local media, including the Minnesota Star Tribune, reported that a number of vehicles believed to belong to the federal government were damaged in the disorder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a social media post on Thursday morning, US President Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act if Minnesota officials did not act to \"stop the professional agitators\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a 200-year-old law which allows the president to use active-duty military personnel for law enforcement duties within the US, and which Trump has previously said he might invoke elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, said the situation in the city, where federal agents have been deployed against the wishes of local officials, was \"unsustainable\".</p></div><figure><div

questionable policy from the central bank and testing the legal limits to get it - to Martin Redrado, sitting in Argentina, Donald Trump's stand-off with the Federal Reserve feels surprisingly familiar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado was fired as head of Argentina's central bank in 2010, after he resisted orders by then-President Cristina Kirchner to hand over reserves to help pay off national debts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He fought the decision successfully in court, but eventually resigned in the face of what he told the BBC was \"intolerable\" pressure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, the clash is remembered as one of the early warnings of the economic turmoil that later engulfed Argentina, exposing it to high inflation and a currency plunge from which the country is still recovering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's fight with the Fed has sparked debate about whether the US might be heading in a similar direction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since his return to office last year, Trump has accused the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, of mishandling the economy and driving up debt costs for the government by keeping interest rates too high.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his interventions at the bank have not been limited to social media complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Trump moved to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx275n8gx0ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sack a top policymaker, Lisa Cook</a>, a decision now being challenged at the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Sunday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c801k7rkkd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Powell said the Fed was facing a criminal probe from the Department of Justice</a>, relating to cost overruns at a property renovation - concerns that Powell has dismissed as \"pretext\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Market reaction to the drama has remained muted, which analysts said was a sign that investors expect the bank to be able to continue operating freely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that faith will be tested in the coming weeks, when the Supreme Court is due to hear arguments about Cook's firing and the president is expected to announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he has been surprised to see echoes of his own battle happening in the US, long held up as a global model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This seems more like an emerging market story,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not alone in making the comparison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is what you do in banana republics, not what should happen in the United States of America,\" economist Jason Furman, who led former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC, using a derogatory term often used to describe countries with unstable politics and economies subject to the whims of a ruling class. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC, former Fed chair Janet Yellen, who served as Treasury Secretary under Joe Biden, raised a similar spectre as she warned against the way Trump wants the Fed to conduct policy. \"It is the road to a banana republic,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Inflationary risks</h2></p><div

in the 1970s, including in the US, leading to a wave of global reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extensive academic research has since linked central bank independence to lower inflation over time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say elected officials have too many incentives to try to use bank power to secure an immediate economic boost or satisfy particular constituencies, even if it might hurt the economy over the long run. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But though Trump's pressure on the Fed is unprecedented for the US, the president is hardly the only head of state to disregard advice to leave central bankers alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, former Prime Minister Liz Truss has attacked the Bank of England, criticising its independence and accusing it of having too much power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study of central banks in 118 countries between 2010 and 2018 found roughly 10% of central banks each year faced pressure from political leaders, like Trump, wanting lower interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive and can deliver a short-term economic boost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressure on central bankers was most likely to emerge in countries with nationalist or populist leaders and was typically followed by higher inflation, says economist Carola Binder, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who conducted the review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cycled through three central bank leaders in three years between 2019 and 2021, as he looked for someone who would execute on his unorthodox view that high interest rates fed inflation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inflation soared past 50%, as the bank bowed to his demands, before he agreed to appoint leaders with more moderate views.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even in countries where central banks resisted the interference, Binder's research found that inflation tended to rise, albeit to a lesser degree, suggesting pressure alone could cause damage.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

suggest inflation expectations in the US remain contained, making the likely significance of the current fight more political than economic, Binder says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still,

economy was unlikely to face as severe a fallout as smaller nations like Argentina and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some say there are already signs the fight is having consequences, pointing to an 8% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the long term, it can be hard to identify the driver of economic damage - whether it is the loss of central bank independence or other, often related issues, like the erosion of democracy or rule of law, says Carolina Garriga, professor of political science at the University of Essex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says immediate market moves, like a dip in the dollar that followed the announcement of the Fed criminal probe, show investors consider central bank independence an important piece of the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to disentangle but it is not hard to disentangle when it's market reaction to an announcement.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the criminal probe became public, key Wall Street leaders and members of Congress, including some Republicans, have spoken up forcefully in defence of the Fed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Supreme Court, justices have also indicated that they see the bank as different from other arms of government, where they have let Trump's firings proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say they think the Fed will be able to maintain confidence in its policies, noting that it sets interest rates via a committee with 12 members, of whom the president appoints only seven and who each have long, staggered terms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is slight concern,\" says Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics. \"But there's not a switch here that says faith in US institutions has been lost and therefore we're in a downward spiral.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But much of the Fed's reputation for independence is rooted in convention, rather than legal design. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/69/2/sqaf024/8108275\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">global comparisons of central bank independence</a>, as measured by legal features, the Fed ranks in the bottom third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he remained hopeful that the strength of US institutions would prevail, unlike in Argentina, while warning that Trump was running unnecessary risk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump is really defeating himself by having this kind of fight,\" he said. \"He should know better.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I am worried that he can't handle these pigs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Daidai, who's in her 20s, promised that those who came to their village, Qingfu, to assist would be treated to a pork banquet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In rural Sichuan and Chongqing, large community meals are an important part of culture, featuring twice-cooked pork, steamed ribs, soup and homemade liquor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me hold my head up high in our village,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her appeal for help attracted more than a million likes and the response on the ground was like a scene from a cheesy feel-good movie, as thousands of cars poured in, carrying many more people than she needed for the task.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So many responded that traffic jams have brought roads in this part of rural Chongqing in south-west China to a standstill. Drone images show carloads of people queuing up with rice crops on either side hoping to still enter Qingfu. Walking in from long distances has been a traffic-beating option for some.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Daidai posted that drivers coming into the area should be careful on the roads, especially those from the city unaccustomed to conditions in the countryside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The atmosphere has been great. It reminded me of my childhood when my family still kept pigs. It has been years since I felt anything like that,\" one man, who drove more than 100 kilometres (65 miles) to get there, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has seen licence plates from all over the country, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the pig slaughter and subsequent mass banquet did happen, it was watched live online by more than 100,000 viewers, registering 20 million likes, and the local government embraced it as a flash-tourism moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With many more people in town than two pigs could feed, tourism officials donated more pigs to meet the huge demand, and small restaurants have been serving crowds of visitors in outdoor seating areas.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3bb4/live/30dbc180-f227-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.png.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Jimu News A girl wearing a white top clutching a mobile phone users a black loudspeaker.

Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: \"Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: \"My dad is very happy.

By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-rs-7280-crore-scheme-to-promote-manufacturing-of-sintered-rare-earth-permanent-magnets-repm/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Under the scheme</a>, selected manufacturers will receive capital and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year within seven years. The aim is to meet rising domestic demand, which officials expect to double in five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Industry experts warn that money alone will not be enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India today imports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2151394&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">80- 90% of its magnets</a> and related materials from China, which controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing.

Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start,\" says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. \"India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are several research centres, he points out, which can be put to the task. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8U3-4liOI\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">facility</a> was inaugurated in 2023 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2022185&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plant</a> backed by public and private partners aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of magnets a year by 2030. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But neither has yet reported output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

For instance, it has set up the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) under which it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2097309&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">pledged</a> to maintain stockpiles and keep its supply chain resilient.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some  of the elements needed to make magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, it has surpluses of lighter rare earths such as neodymium, but lacks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1914305&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">extractable quantities</a> of heavier elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for many high-performance magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short  - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale,\" Ms Mukherjee explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going,\" Mr Gupta says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think this is certainly better than not having taken the step at all.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

rumours of differences at the very top of the Taliban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a split the Taliban leadership has always denied - including when asked directly by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the rumours prompted the BBC's Afghan service to begin a year-long investigation into the highly secretive group - conducting more than 100 interviews with current and former members of the Taliban, as well as local sources, experts and former diplomats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because of the sensitivity over reporting this story, the BBC has agreed not to identify them for their safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, for the first time, we have been able to map two distinct groups at the very top of the Taliban - each presenting competing visions for Afghanistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One entirely loyal to Akhundzada, who, from his base in Kandahar, is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate - isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a second, made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which - while still following a strict interpretation of Islam - engages with the outside, builds the country's economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One insider described it as \"the Kandahar house versus Kabul\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the question was always whether the Kabul group, made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists, would ever challenge the increasingly authoritarian Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, according to the Taliban, Akhundzada is the group's absolute ruler - a man only accountable to Allah, and not someone to be challenged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Listen: Audio obtained by the BBC of Taliban supreme leader</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late September, Akhundzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what had happened behind the scenes was seismic, say insiders. The Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada's order and switched the internet back on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Taliban, unlike every other Afghan party or faction, is remarkable for its coherence – there have been no splits, not even much dissent,\" explains an expert on Afghanistan, who has been studying the Taliban since they were established.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Bound into the movement's DNA is the principle of obedience to one's superiors, and ultimately to the Amir [Akhundzada].

The ban on education, along with women working, remains one of the \"main sources of tension\" between the two groups, a letter from a UN monitoring body to the Security Council noted in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, another insider told the BBC that Akhundzada, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban's Sharia courts of the 1990s, was becoming \"even more rigid\" in his religious beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Akhundzada's ideology was already such that he not only knew but approved of his son's choice to become a suicide bomber, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-supreme-leader-son-suicide-attack.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">according to two Taliban officials after his death in 2017.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he is convinced that making the wrong decision could have implications beyond his lifetime, the BBC has been told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every decision he makes he says: I'm accountable to Allah, on judgement day, I will be questioned why I didn't take an action,\" one current Taliban government official explained.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two people who have been in meetings with Akhundzada described to the BBC how they were faced with a man who barely spoke, choosing to communicate mainly through gestures, interpreted through a team of elderly clerics in the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In more public settings, other eyewitnesses said he obscures his face - covering his eyes with a scarf draped over his turban, and often standing at an angle when addressing an audience. Photographing or filming Akhundzada is forbidden. Only two photos of him are known to exist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Getting a meeting has also become increasingly difficult. Another Taliban member told the BBC how Akhundzada used to hold \"regular consultations\", but now \"most Taliban ministers wait for days or weeks\". Another source told the BBC the Kabul-based ministers have been told to \"travel to Kandahar only if they receive an official invitation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, Akhundzada was moving key departments to Kandahar - including distribution of weapons, which had previously come under the control of his former deputies Haqqani and Yaqoob.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its December letter, the UN monitoring team noted Akhundzada's \"consolidation of power has also involved a continued build-up of security forces under the direct control of Kandahar\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units - bypassing ministers in Kabul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One analyst argues the result is that \"real authority has been transferred to Kandahar\" - something Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied to the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions - all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, \"from a Sharia perspective, he [Akhundzada] has the absolute power\", Mujahid added - saying \"to avoid God-forbidden division, his decisions are final\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Men 'who have seen the world'</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1b61/live/2a994620-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AP A boy flies a kite on a hilltop overlooking Kabul, Afghanistan, Feb. 27, 2022.

One expert points out Taliban members have been happy to follow Akhundzada despite disagreeing with edicts like the ones on girls' education.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, many of those who had challenged him openly before had paid a price.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In February 2025, the then-deputy foreign minister had to flee the country after warning publicly the leadership was straying from \"the path of God\" in \"committing injustice against 20 million people\" - a reference to the female education ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN monitors point to at least two others who have been arrested after questioning Akhundzada's decrees on girls' education, in July and September 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is also evidence of Akhundzada and his allies moving to keep figures like Haqqani close - despite the latter's public criticisms of the supreme leader's consolidation of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even so, tipping over from words into actions and so decisively disregarding an order was arguably another step all together.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As one expert points out, this time it may have been worth the risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their positions come with power and an \"ability to make money\", the expert says. But both depended on the internet, now crucial to both governing and commerce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Turning off the internet threatened their privileges in a way that keeping older girls out of education never did,\" the expert points out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe that's why they were 'brave' that one time.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8524/live/7cd5fa50-d757-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AP Girls attend school on the first day of the new school year, in Kabul, Afghanistan, on March 25, 2023.

Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza would seem like progress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there remains a huge lack of clarity and detail about the future of the strip and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Furthermore, there are many pitfalls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First, Trump's plan demands that Hamas, as well as other groups in Gaza, agree to disarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announcing phase two of the deal, the US Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, said failure to do so would \"bring serious consequences\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Hamas has so far adamantly refused to give up its weapons, which it sees as tools of resistance to Israel's decades-long military occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it maintains that position, there are already far-right members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government who are champing at the bit to resume the war and \"finish the job\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While massively diminished militarily, US intelligence has long estimated that Hamas has likely recruited more new members in Gaza than have been killed by Israel during the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ceasefire, which has been in place since October last year, is already fragile at best.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both sides have accused each other of repeated violations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian armed groups during the same period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Secondly, there is little clarity over to what extent Israel will be required to withdraw its forces from Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has given no indication that it is willing to pull back completely, insisting it needs to maintain a strong security presence in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel officials talk of \"a new reality\" in Gaza, insisting that the strip will never go back to the way it was before Hamas launched its deadly attack on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, there could be continued wrangling over how far Israeli forces withdraw.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there is the issue of governance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Who will run Gaza, if not Hamas, which came to power after winning Palestinian elections almost exactly 20 years ago?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Who will provide policing, security, schools, hospitals?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For more than a year now, there has been the idea that some sort of International Stabilization Force could provide security in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egypt, Turkey, the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, as well as the West Bank-based, Palestinian Authority, have all been suggested as potential countries that would make up this force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But none have committed and, again, the detail is unclear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anyone seen as \"riding in on the back of Israeli tanks\" is likely to meet a frosty reception from Palestinians in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Trump's peace plan, Gaza will supposedly have three levels of governance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the lowest level, the strip will be run by a new government of technocrats made up of figures from civil society within Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The names of its members were announced on Wednesday, with Hamas having agreed to have no role in the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Above that will be an Executive Committee based outside Gaza to oversee the new government's work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is likely to be made up of non-Palestinians, with former British prime minister Tony Blair said be among those who will sit on the committee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Blair is widely distrusted by Palestinians, being seen as too close to Israel, and for his role, alongside former US president George W Bush, in the second Iraq War launched in 2003.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Finally, above the Executive Committee will be the Board of Peace, with Trump as its chairman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are rumoured to be among the board's proposed members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Palestinians say having foreigners in effect running Gaza smacks of colonialism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The question is: do they have a choice?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And all the while, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains utterly bleak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the ceasefire was announced last October, more aid has been allowed into the strip, but aid agencies say it is still nowhere near enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of thousands of Gazans remain homeless and are living in makeshift tents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last few months in the region has seen grim winter weather, with torrential rain, high winds and temperatures below 5C (41F).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaza has experienced severe flooding, with buildings collapsing and tents blown away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most children have had little or no education for more than two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What does the future hold for them?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, while phase two of the peace plan may seem like progress, there remain many reasons for pessimism.</p></div></div></body></html>"

After the coup she was given jail sentences totalling 27 years on what are widely viewed as fabricated charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet despite her disappearance from public view, she still casts a long shadow over Myanmar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are repeated calls for her release, along with appeals to the generals to end their ruinous campaign against the armed opposition and negotiate an end to the civil war that has now dragged on for five years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military has tried to remove her once ubiquitous image, but you still see faded posters of \"The Lady\", or \"Amay Su\", Mother Su, as she is affectionately known, in tucked away corners. Could she still play a role in settling the conflict between the soldiers and the people of Myanmar?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After all, it has happened before. Back in 2010 the military had been in power for nearly 50 years, brutally crushed all opposition and run the economy into the ground.

It was a more optimistic era; the generals could see their South East Asian neighbours prospering through trade with the Western world, and they wanted an end to crippling economic sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also sought better relations with the US as a counterbalance to their dependence on China, at a time when the Obama administration was making its celebrated \"pivot\" to Asia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The top generals were still hard-line and suspicious, but there was a group of less senior officers keen to explore a political compromise. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear what finally persuaded the military leadership to open the country up, but they clearly believed their 2008 constitution, which guaranteed the armed forces one-quarter of the seats in a future parliament, would be enough, with their well-funded party, to limit Aung San Suu Kyi's influence once she was released.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They badly underestimated her massive star power, and they underestimated how much their decades of misrule had alienated most of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 2015 election the USDP won just over 6% of the seats in both houses of parliament. In the next election in 2020 it expected to perform much better, after five years of an NLD administration which had started with impossibly high hopes, and had inevitably disappointed many of them. But the USDP fared even worse, winning just 5% of seats in the two houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even many of those who were dissatisfied with Aung San Suu Kyi's performance in government still chose hers over the military's party. This raised the possibility that she might eventually win enough support to change the constitution, and end the military's privileged position. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also ruled out the armed forces commander Min Aung Hlaing's hopes of becoming president after his retirement. He launched his coup on 1 February 2021, the day Aung San Suu Kyi was due to inaugurate her new government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time there are no reformers in the ranks, and no hopes of the kind of compromise which restored democracy back in 2010. The shocking violence used to put down protests against the coup has driven many young Burmese to take up arms against the junta. Tens of thousands have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed. Attitudes on both sides have hardened.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/918e/live/f2bf5660-f10d-11f0-8d8c-119c97eeca07.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, Myanmar Commander In-Chief (L) and National League for Democracy (NLD) party leader Aung San Suu Kyi (R) shake hands after their meeting at the Commander in-Chief's office in Naypyidaw on December 2, 2015. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aung San Suu Kyi and Min Aung Hlaing in December 2015, after her party won the first free election in decades</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 15 years Aung San Suu Kyi was detained after 1989, under conditions of house arrest in her lakeside family home in Yangon, were very different from the conditions she is being held in today. Her dignified, non-violent resistance won her admirers across Myanmar and around the world, and during the occasional spells of freedom the military gave her she was able to give rousing speeches from her front gate, or interviews to journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today she is invisible. Her long-held belief in non-violent struggle has been rejected by those who have joined the armed resistance, who argue that they must fight to end the military's role in Myanmar's political life. There is a lot more criticism of how Aung San Suu Kyi governed when she was in power than before. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her decision to lead Myanmar's defence against charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice over the military's atrocities against Muslim Rohingyas in 2017 badly tarnished her saint-like international image. It had much less resonance inside Myanmar, but many younger opposition activists are now willing to condemn how she handled the Rohingya crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the age of 80, with uncertain health, it is not clear how much influence she would have, were she to be released, even if she still wants to play a central role.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet her long struggle against military rule made her synonymous with all the hopes of a freer, more democratic future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is simply no-one else of her stature in Myanmar, and for that reason alone, many would argue, she is probably still needed if the country is to chart a path out of its current deadlock.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family. It was really warm, really healing and really meaningful.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She thanked government officials and the police for allowing a sudden celebration of this size to proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is already being predicted that the now famous Hechuan region, where her village is located, may try to turn this into a regular event, to tap into the enthusiasm for genuine, grass-roots interaction in a world where many feel isolated and removed from their culture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One villager was quoted in the People's Daily as saying: \"Here neighbours help each other. Today I might help you slaughter a pig at your place, tomorrow you will come to my place to do the same.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Daidai's father, she said in an interview: \"My dad is very happy.

Robina Aminian, a 23-year-old fashion-design student who hoped to study in Milan, was shot dead in Tehran on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her mother spent about six hours travelling from their home, in the western city of Kermanshah, to collect Robina's body from Tehran. On her way back, she held her beloved daughter in her arms. But when she arrived, the security forces made her bury the body in a remote cemetery outside the city - with no other family or friends present.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not all those killed were protesters.

On Saturday, Sahanand had seen more than 2,000 bodies lying on the ground, he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Again, the BBC has no means to confirm this. However, in two newly emerged videos from Kahrizak, BBC Verify and BBC Persian have counted at least 186 bodies in one piece of footage and at least 178 bodies in the other. The two videos probably show some of the same bodies, so we cannot be definitive, but the true figure is likely to be much higher.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/68c4/live/9ce864d0-f157-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"User generated content People viewed from behind march along a Tehran street at night, on 8 January 2026.
