The senator continued: \"It is not our recommendation. It is not our peace plan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly after, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said Rounds's account of his conversation with Rubio was \"blatantly false\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wrote on X: \"As Secretary Rubio and the entire administration has consistently maintained, this plan was authored by the United States, with input from both the Russians and Ukrainians.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio then posted on social media himself, saying: \"The peace proposal was authored by the US. It is based on input from the Russian side. But it is also based on previous and ongoing input from Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Trump - who has made securing a deal to end the conflict a central foreign policy goal during his second term - said the plan did not represent a \"final offer\" for Ukraine, having previously said President Volodymyr Zelensky \"will have to\" approve it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X on Saturday, Vice President JD Vance said criticism of the proposed peace plan \"either misunderstands the framework or misstates some critical reality on the ground\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a fantasy that if we just give more money, more weapons, or more sanctions, victory is at hand,\" he said, adding that peace will not be made by \"politicians living in a fantasy land\". </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3884/live/fb144250-c816-11f0-8df7-754053979857.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney, France’s President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz stand together, as they attend a family photo event, on the opening day of the G20 Leaders' Summit at the Nasrec Expo Centre in Johannesburg, South Africa.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The leaders of several Ukrainian allies - including Canada, France and Germany - met at the G20 summit</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When details of the 28-point plan first emerged, Zelensky warned that his country faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept it, while Russian President Vladimir Putin said it could form the \"basis\" of an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump previously gave Ukraine until Thursday to approve the proposal, though said that deadline could be extended if talks progress. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Rubio and Witkoff will attend the Geneva meeting on Sunday alongside security officials from the UK, France and Germany, as well as Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's allies have already publicly pushed back against the plan, saying in a joint statement issued at the G20 summit in South Africa that it \"would leave Ukraine vulnerable to attack\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\" but would \"require additional work\", citing concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The statement was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two senior EU officials were also among the signatories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking at the gathering in Johannesburg, French President Emmanuel Macron said the plan \"cannot simply be an American proposal\", adding that any agreement had to also guarantee security for \"all Europeans\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said \"we are still quite a long way from a good outcome for everyone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer spoke to both Zelensky and Trump on Saturday. No 10 said he briefed the US president on European talks about the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, after which Ukraine became heavily dependent on US-manufactured weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its current form, the plan would see Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aishat arrived in Armenia with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people.

It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia.

As consumers grow restless about the cost of groceries, housing and other essentials, Trump has tried to convey a message of economic stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his election campaign in New York City, Mamdani maintained a laser focus on the lack of affordable housing and proposed freezing rent increases on certain rent-stabilised apartments, among other initiatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani said he and Trump discussed how to \"deliver affordability to New Yorkers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whenever he was asked a question about their differing views, the mayor-elect brought the conversation back to this topic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Facing one question about their different views on achieving peace in the Middle East, Mamdani responded that Trump voters had expressed to him a wish for \"an end to forever wars\" and for leaders to address \"the cost-of-living crisis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On law enforcement and immigration, they also appeared to find some common ground. Mamdani said he and Trump discussed federal immigration-enforcement operations in New York, and he relayed concerns from residents about how they are being conducted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump said they discussed crime more than immigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He doesn't want to see crime and I don't want to see crime,\" the president said. He had \"very little doubt\" the two wouldn't get along on that issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump even said he would feel safe living in a Mamdani-led New York.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A complication for Republicans' strategy? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cordial relations on display on Friday may complicate efforts by Republicans to use the self-described democratic socialist as a bogeyman in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, when control of the US Congress will be up for grabs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In elections earlier this month, Republicans struggled and Democrats won key races. It's unclear whether that trend will hold. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans had plans in place to make Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party, according to US news site Axios. They included painting him as anti-police, anti-capitalism and anti-Israel in an effort to give Republicans a leg-up in key races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Oval Office chuminess could undercut that strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While praising Mamdani, the president said he believed the new mayor would \"surprise some conservative people\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In the streets of Caracas, daily life continues while the government tells the population that they must be ready for a US invasion</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bolívar (in Bolívar state, south) tells the BBC by phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Consuelo says that uncertainty also makes Venezuelans nervous</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike… people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Javier Jaramillo also does not believe that an attack on Venezuela is imminent</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's now midday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Other nations - particularly those with most to gain from their continued production - felt vindicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The summit was a reality check on just how much global consensus has broken down over what to do about climate change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here are five key takeaways from what some have called the \"COP of truth\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Brazil - not their finest hour</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most important thing to come out of COP30 is that the climate 'ship' is still afloat</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many participants are unhappy that they didn't get anything close to what they wanted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And despite a great deal of warmth for Brazil and for President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, there is frustration with the way they ran this meeting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Right from the off there seemed to be a gulf between what President Lula wanted this meeting to achieve, and what COP president President André Corrêa do Lago felt was possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So Lula talked of roadmaps away from fossil fuels to the handful of world leaders that came to Belém before the official start of the COP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was taken up by a number of countries including the UK, and within days there was a campaign to get this roadmap formally into the negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Do Lago wasn't keen. His north star was consensus. He knew that forcing the issue of fossil fuels on the agenda would rupture that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the initial text for agreement had some vague references to things that looked like a roadmap, within days they were gone, never to return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia and the European Union and around 80 countries tried to find some language that would signal a stronger step away from coal, oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To find consensus, do Lago convened a mutirão, a kind of Brazilian group discussion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It made matters worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Negotiators from Arab countries refused to join huddles with those who wanted a pathway away from fossil energy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU were given short shrift by major producers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We make energy policy in our capital not in yours,\" the Saudi delegate told them in a closed-door meeting, according to one observer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ouch!</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nothing could bridge the gap - and the talks teetered on the verge of collapse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brazil came up with a face-saving idea of roadmaps on deforestation and fossil fuels that would exist outside the COP.</p><p

Agreement</a> but this COP has not been the European Union's finest hour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While they have been grandstanding on the need for a fossil fuel roadmap, they backed themselves into a corner on another aspect of the agreement that they eventually couldn't get out of.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea of tripling money for climate adaptation was in the early text and survived into the final draft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The wording was vague so that the EU didn't object – but crucially the \"tripling\" word stayed in the text.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So when the EU tried to press the developing world to support the idea of a fossil fuel roadmap, they didn't have anything to sweeten the deal – as the tripling concept was already baked in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Overall we are seeing a European Union that has been cornered,\" said Li Shuo, from the Asia Society, a long-time observer of climate politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This partly reflects the power shift in the real world, the emerging power of the BASIC and BRICs countries, and the decline of the European

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most persistent question asked here at COP30 over the two weeks was about the future of the 'process' itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two often heard positions:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How barmy is it to fly thousands of people half-way around the world to sit in giant air-conditioned tents to argue about commas, and interpretations of convoluted words?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How ridiculous that the key discussions here, on the very future of the way that we will power our world occur at 3am in the morning among sleep deprived delegates who haven't been home in weeks?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The COP idea served the world well in ultimately delivering the Paris climate agreement – but that was a decade ago and many participants feel that it doesn't have a clear, powerful purpose anymore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can't discard it entirely,\" Harjeet Singh, an activist with the Fossil Fuel Treaty Initiative, told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But it requires retrofitting. We will need processes outside this system to help complement what we have done so far.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Energy costs and the valid questions about how countries reach net zero emissions have never been more critical – yet the COP idea seems very far removed from the day to day lives of billions of people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a consensus process that comes from a different era. We are not in that world anymore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brazil recognised some of these issues and tried to make this an \"implementation cop\" and put a lot of focus on the \"energy agenda\". But no one really knows what those ideas actually meant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">COP leaders are reading the room - they are trying to find a new approach that is needed or this conference will lose all relevance.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trade comes in from the cold</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the first time global trade became one of the key issues at these talks.  There was an \"orchestrated\" effort to raise it in every negotiating room, according to veteran COP-watcher Alden Meyer of the climate think-tank E3G.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">'What's that got to do with climate change?' you are probably thinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The answer is that the European Union is planning to introduce a border tax on certain high-carbon products like steel, fertiliser, cement, and aluminium and lots of its trading partners – notably China, India and Saudi Arabia aren't happy about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say it isn't fair for a big trading bloc to impose what they call a one-sided - \"unilateral\" is the technical term - measure like this because it will make the goods they sell into Europe more expensive - and therefore less competitive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Europeans say that's wrong because the measure is not about stifling trade but about cutting planet-warming gases – tackling climate change.  They already charge their own producers of these products a fee for the emissions they create and say the border tax is a way to protect them from less environmentally friendly but cheaper imports from abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you don't want to pay our border tax, they say, just charge emissions fees on your polluting industries - collect the money yourselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Economists like that idea because the more expensive it is to pollute, the more likely we all are to switch to clean energy alternatives.  Although - of course - it also means we'll pay more for any goods we buy that contain polluting materials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue was resolved here in Brazil with a classic COP compromise - pushing the discussions into future talks. The final agreement launched an on-going dialogue on trade for future UN climate talks, involving governments as well as other actors like the World Trade Organization.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/acde/live/4f6e6d30-c7f4-11f0-975d-d5fa2587428e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Tom Ingham/BBC A crowd stare at a table full of souvenirs at the Chinese pavilion at COP30 in Belém, Brazil\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Tom Ingham/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Huge crowds looking for souvenirs crowded into the Chinese pavilion at COP30</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trump gains by staying away - China gains by staying quiet</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The world's two biggest carbon emitters, China and the US, had similar impacts on this COP but achieved them in different ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump stayed away, but his stance emboldened his allies here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia, normally a relatively quiet participant, was to the fore in blocking efforts on roadmaps.

the \"style resonated across various building typologies, including schools, cinemas, bungalows, petrol stations and banks,\" Mr Kumar said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Art Deco buildings in

Others come across as vague and imprecise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's sovereignty would be \"<i id='confirmed\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">confirmed\" </i>and there would be a <i id='\"total-and-complete-comprehensive-non-aggression-agreement-between-russia,-ukraine-and-europe\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"total and complete comprehensive non-aggression agreement between Russia, Ukraine and Europe\"</i>, with robust or reliable <i id='\"security-guarantees\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"security guarantees\"</i> for Kyiv and a demand for snap elections in 100 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Russia were to invade Ukraine a <i id='\"robust-co-ordinated-military-response\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"robust co-ordinated military response\"</i> is proposed along with a restoration of sanctions and a scrapping of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although elections are impossible in Ukraine as there is martial law in place, they could theoretically be held if a peace deal is signed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on security guarantees, there is no detail on who would provide them and how robust they might be. This falls well short of a Nato-style Article Five commitment to  treat an attack on Ukraine as an attack on all. Kyiv would want more than a vague promise if it were to sign up.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Handover of Ukraine's territory and cut in armed forces</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the most contentious proposals are Ukraine handing over its own unoccupied territory and cutting the size of its armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukrainian-forces-will-withdraw-from-the-part-of-donetsk-oblast-that-they-currently-control,-and-this-withdrawal-zone-will-be-considered-a-neutral-demilitarized-buffer-zone,-internationally-recognized-as-territory-belonging-to-the-russian-federation.-russian-forces-will-not-enter-this-demilitarised-zone.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukrainian forces will withdraw from the part of Donetsk Oblast that they currently control, and this withdrawal zone will be considered a neutral demilitarized buffer zone, internationally recognized as territory belonging to the Russian Federation. Russian forces will not enter this demilitarised zone.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians. Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture the town of Pokrovsk - Ukraine is unlikely to hand over such important strategic hubs without a fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"the-size-of-the-ukrainian-armed-forces-will-be-limited-to-600,000-personnel.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"The size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's military was estimated last January at 880,000 active personnel, up from 250,000 at the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While 600,000 might seem a potentially acceptable number in peacetime, that kind of limitation would infringe on Ukrainian sovereignty. It might also be too big a number for Russia to accept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our red lines are clear and unwavering,\" Ukrainian representative Khrystyna Hayovyshyn told the UN security Council: \"There will never be any recognition formal or otherwise of Ukrainian territory temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation as Russian. Ukraine will not accept any limits on its rights to self defence or on the size or capabilities of our armed forces.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft also proposes that \"<i id='crimea,-luhansk-and-donetsk-will-be-recognized-as-de-facto-russian,-including-by-the-united-states\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States\"</i>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words Ukraine and other countries would not need to recognise Russian control by law. That could enable Kyiv to accept such phrasing, as it would not impinge on Ukraine's constitution that says its borders are \" indivisible and inviolable\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzia, the front lines would be frozen and Russia would relinquish areas it has occupied elsewhere in Ukraine.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ukraine's future - with EU but not Nato</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes significant commitments on Ukraine's strategic future:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-agrees-to-enshrine-in-its-constitution-that-it-will-not-join-nato-and-nato-agrees-to-include-in-its-statutes-a-provision-that-ukraine-will-not-be-admitted-in-the-future.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine agrees to enshrine in its constitution that it will not join Nato and Nato agrees to include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id='\"ukraine-is-eligible-for-eu-membership-and-will-get-short-term-preferred-market-access-to-the-european-market-while-this-issue-is-being-evaluated.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Ukraine is eligible for EU membership and will get short-term preferred market access to the European market while this issue is being evaluated.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is little chance of Ukraine joining Nato any time soon and Russia has in recent months softened its stance on Ukraine's candidacy for EU membership. The document appears to offer Kyiv access to EU markets while ignoring the views of 27 European countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joining both the EU and Nato are part of Ukraine's constitution and another of Khrystyna Hayovyshyn's red lines at the UN on Thursday was: \"Nor will we tolerate any infringement on our sovereignty including our sovereign right to choose the alliances we want to join.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other draft proposals are that Nato agrees not to station troops in Ukraine and that European fighter jets will be stationed in Poland. Kyiv would also have to commit to being a <i id='\"non-nuclear-state\".' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"non-nuclear state\".</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That appears to reject the West's Coalition of the Willing's plans led by the UK and France to help police any future deal.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bringing Russia back from isolation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several points refer to Russia being brought back from isolation with <i id='\"russia-to-be-re-integrated-into-the-global-economy\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"Russia to be re-integrated into the global economy\"</i> and invited back into the G8 group of powers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That seems a long way off for now, with Putin under an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court. Russia was thrown out of the G7 after it seized and then annexed Crimea in 2014 and Trump tried to bring Putin back into the fold six years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan were reluctant before the full-scale invasion, there's even less chance of that happening now.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What about Russia's frozen assets?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The draft proposes that $100bn of frozen Russian assets should be invested<i id='\"in-us-led-efforts-to-rebuild-and-invest-in-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"in US-led efforts to rebuild and invest in Ukraine\"</i>, with the US receiving 50% of the profits and Europe adding $100bn in investment for reconstruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is reminiscent of the US minerals deal with Ukraine earlier this year, extracting an American price for involvement, and it also leaves the European Union with nothing but hefty bills.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sums it mentions may not be sufficient, either: earlier this year the total cost of reconstruction in Ukraine was put at $524bn (€506bn).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some €200bn in Russia frozen assets are largely held by Euroclear in Belgium, and the European Union is currently working on a plan to use the money to fund Kyiv financially and militarily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rest of those frozen assets would go to a <i id='\"us-russian-investment-vehicle\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"US-Russian investment vehicle\"</i>, under the draft, so Russia would see some of its money come back, but again there would be a financial benefit for the US.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is not in the plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several commentators have pointed out that the plan does not require weapons limitations on Ukraine's military or its arms industry, even though there is a provision saying: If Ukraine fires a missile at Moscow or St. Petersburg then the security guarantee will be considered null and void.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it does not place an restriction on the long-range weapons Ukraine has been developing - such as its Flamingo and Long Neptune missiles.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is this a definitive peace plan?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We know the US is keen to press ahead fast under an \"aggressive timeline\" with this draft, with reports suggesting Ukraine has until Thanksgiving late next week to agree to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Equally US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in drafting it, described it as \"a list of potential ideas for ending this war\", and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has made clear he does not see the 28 points as a definitive plan, having spoken to the other key US official involved, Trump envoy Steve Witkoff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some respects the draft document seems like work in progress, with some details that were leaked to US websites on Thursday no longer apparent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union said on Friday morning it had not officially seen the plan yet, and the Russian foreign ministry said the same.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is the draft a Putin wishlist?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev is known to have spent as long as three days with Witkoff discussing this plan, raising suggestions of a stitched-up deal to suit Moscow. Russia's response has so far been cautious but Putin has said it <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy5g4r9l4dlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">could be the \"basis\" for a peace settlement</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handover of Ukrainian territory to Russia, even in a demilitarised zone, is the biggest sign of a slant towards Russia's narrative, but freezing the front lines in the south could prove difficult for the Kremlin which has annexed both Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in its constitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the proposals is for the lifting of sanctions to be <i id='\"agreed-upon-in-stages-and-on-a-case-by-case-basis\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"agreed upon in stages and on a case-by-case basis\"</i> - which Moscow will probably see as far too slow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a plan for a<i id='\"full-amnesty\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"full amnesty\" </i>for all parties will go down well in Moscow and very badly in Kyiv and European capitals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commentators have pointed out that while there do appear to be major concessions to Putin, some of the requirements for Nato might be too vague for Kremlin tastes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also consistently demanded that a peace plan would need to eliminate what it sees as \"the root causes\" of the war. One of those root causes is halting Nato expansion in Eastern Europe, which the draft appears to deal with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the other 28 points of the draft also nod to Russia's claims of discrimination against Ukraine's Russian-speaking population without explicitly endorsing them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One point is explicit but even-handed:<i id='\"both-countries-will-agree-to-abolish-all-discriminatory-measures-and-guarantee-the-rights-of-ukrainian-and-russian-media-and-education.\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> \"Both countries will agree to abolish all discriminatory measures and guarantee the rights of Ukrainian and Russian media and education.\"</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another apparent attempt to be even-handed comes from a proposal to distribute electricity generated by the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant - the biggest in Europe - <i id='\"equally-between-russia-and-ukraine\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">\"equally between Russia and Ukraine\"</i>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It has firmly denied claims of a white genocide and insisted that the summit would proceed with or without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a sudden about face, and with less than 48 hours to go before the G20 conference, the US announced that it would be sending a small team of its in-country diplomats to the handover ceremony, but that it wouldn't take part in any discussions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As tension between the two nations shows no sign of letting up, there are concerns that South African diplomats may be frozen out of meetings when the US takes over the G20 presidency next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's Finance Minister, Enoch Godongwana, told reporters earlier this week that there's only one way they would not attend next year's meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are members of the G20, we're not an invited country. So we don't need an invitation from anybody,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States do not want us to participate, the only way they can do it is to decline us visas.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/08fe/live/132a4c10-c6fd-11f0-a863-434ee92aa5e3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images President Donald Trump show President Cyril Ramaphosa a pile of documents\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">At a meeting earlier this year, Donald Trump ambushed Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, with widely discredited claims that white South Africans were being persecuted</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So will South Africa manage to reach its aims without the presence of the world's wealthiest nation? Professor Richard Calland, from the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, thinks it can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that people who are serious-minded in their analysis will not attach much weight to [the US' absence],\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ironically, the absence of President Trump may create more space for real consensus, because people won't be constantly looking over their shoulder at him and trying to anticipate or navigate his conduct and his positioning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Calland adds that the absence of the US may enable middle powers to step up and push for the reforms they want by issuing a joint declaration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Answering reporters' questions at the summit's venue in Johannesburg on Monday, South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola echoed this sentiment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[The United States] are absent, so in their absence, the countries that are present must make a decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are forging ahead to persuade the countries that are present that we must adopt a leaders' declaration because the institution cannot be bogged down by someone who's absent,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The leaders' declaration is a culmination of work done throughout the year to build consensus on issues affecting the global economy, including trade barriers, technological advancements and climate change. It outlines what decisions the members have agreed to act on moving forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump isn't the only head of state who will not be attending. China's Xi Jinping is sending his Premier Li Qiang, who has represented the president in a number of meetings this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian leader <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-64992727\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Vladimir Putin will also be absent due to the International Criminal Court's warrant against him</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum is another leader who will not be attending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Argentinian President and Trump ally, Javier Milei, is skipping the summit in solidarity with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, unlike the US, all of these countries are sending senior delegations to represent their countries' interests.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lamola was keen to downplay the significance of these absences, saying sometimes heads of state are not able to attend major events, and it is \"nothing abnormal\" for them to send a replacement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other global powers have expressed their support of South Africa's presidency of the G20, including France, the UK and the European Union, which signed a deal with South Africa on Thursday agreeing to boost the extraction and, more importantly, the domestic processing, of critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries have long argued that processing minerals in their countries before exporting them would boost their economies by providing much-needed development, jobs and income.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are the types of initiatives that Pretoria has spent the year lobbying for across various working groups and ministerial meetings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa is the last G20 country to take over the presidency in this current cycle. It's also the last country in the global south to host the gathering. Indonesia, India and Brazil have led the summit over the past three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As such, the South African government says it wants to use its presidency to bridge the developmental divide between the global north and south. It wants to push for equity, sustainability and shared prosperity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although building consensus through multilateral institutions like the G20 is becoming increasingly fraught in a divided world, Prof Calland argues that it is needed more than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Human life on Earth is facing an existential set of challenges, whether it's climate change, demographic shifts, technological revolution and so on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of these are hugely difficult pressure points for human society. And you can't deal with them unless there is international collaboration and cooperation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and his supporters argue that multilateral organisations do little to change real people's lives, preferring instead bilateral deals done directly between two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But South Africa and other developing countries argue that issues like reducing the cost of borrowing for poorer countries require the input of international institutions like the IMF and cannot be done through one-on-one deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, South Africa's presidency of the G20 is part of a wider debate around multilateralism and its effectiveness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If South Africa is able to convince other G20 members to issue a joint declaration on Sunday, it might have succeeded in proving that consensus can be reached without the participation of the world's most powerful country.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More BBC stories about South Africa:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

So far 83 people have been killed in at least 21 strikes, according to US statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth says that the campaign is aimed at removing \"narco-terrorists from our hemisphere\" and securing the US from \"the drugs that are killing our people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration justifies them as a necessary self-defence measure aimed at saving American lives by stopping drugs from entering the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the strikes have attracted condemnation in countries in the region and concern that they breach international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia's President Gustavo Petro has criticised the strikes, saying Colombian citizens were on board the boat hit on 15 September, and later claiming Mr Carranza was among those killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to his first statement about Colombian citizens being killed, the White House said it looked forward to President Petro \"publicly retracting his baseless and reprehensible statement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also accused Petro of encouraging the production of drugs and threated to cut off US aid to Colombia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza comes from a huge family, living with about 20 relatives in a small house off a dirt track in the fishing village of Gaira.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Petro <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.presidencia.gov.co/prensa/Paginas/La-sociedad-norteamericana-debe-saber-que-estan-asesinando-gente-pobre-251108.aspx\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">alleged</a> that he wanted to help his daughter study at university, and so accepted a payment from a drug trafficker to transport some drugs to an island, when his boat was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But whether it was fish or cocaine [he was transporting], he wasn't subject to the death penalty,\" Petro said. He accused the US of \"murder\" and since said he ordered Colombian public security forces to suspend intelligence sharing with the US until the strikes end. His defence minister later said the president had given \"clear instructions to maintain, as has been done, a continuous flow of information with international agencies to combat drug trafficking\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Carranza has a past criminal record over stealing weapons from the police nine years ago, but his family deny – and say they are hurt by – characterisations of him as a narco-trafficker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What the president of the United States is doing isn't right. He has to prove if they are or aren't [trafficking],\" Lizbeth says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says while Trump may want to tackle issues affecting his \"territory\" that \"doesn't mean he should resort to these methods… of taking someone's life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US lawyer working for some of Mr Carranza's family, Daniel Kovalik, who also works for President Petro, says Mr Carranza's wife and older daughter recognised his boat from the US-released footage of the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He intends to sue the US government on the family's behalf. International law says the military cannot kill civilians unless they pose an imminent threat of violence, even if engaging in criminal activity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if you claim that the people you're killing are trafficking drugs, you don't have the right to just engage in extrajudicial killings,\" Mr Kovalik said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're tiny boats… If you really believe they were doing something wrong, those people should be arrested, tried in a court of law, convicted, and sentenced.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And, by the way, none of them would be sentenced to the death penalty – this is not a capital crime.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has told Congress that it believes the US is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In doing so, it appears to be invoking war-time powers, such as killing enemy combatants even if they pose no immediate violent threat, to justify the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have said the US is \"under threat\" from \"terrorist organisations\" and said drugs kill thousands of Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) says seizures of cocaine – the major drug trafficked and produced in South America – rose by about 18% in 2024 compared to the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the main driver of drug deaths in the US is Fentanyl, which is produced and arrives in the US from Mexico.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kovalik does not buy the US's self-defence argument, saying \"these boats have never attacked the United States\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Juan Assis Tejeda says he and his fellow fishermen are fearful they could be targeted by strikes</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Taganga, the strikes are causing apprehension for fishermen like 81-year-old Juan Assis Tejeda, whose skin is tanned and leathered from 70 years fishing these waters under the Caribbean's baking sun – just like his grandfather and father before him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He regularly fishes near the border with Venezuela, just along the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He describes how he has sometimes seen drones flying over them while out fishing that \"hover quietly, come back again, and disappear\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though he is just fishing, he is now fearful because of the ongoing strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At any moment they could see us and think we're doing the same thing. Because sometimes we also go 60 miles or so out to sea, looking for tuna.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says some fishermen do get involved in transporting drugs due to poverty. He says he was once offered money himself, but he said no.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would prefer to stick to the little money that he earns and live \"peacefully\" than run the risks associated with transporting drugs, he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mr Tejeda says he has seen drones hovering while he has been out fishing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most in this region do not believe that this is just about targeting small, alleged drug-trafficking boats, but instead about the US also wanting to put military pressure on Venezuela's president Nicolás Maduro to step aside – or on his allies, for example in the military, to oust him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US accuses Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation which it calls the Cartel de los Soles, something Maduro strongly denies. The US state department intends to designate this group a foreign terrorist organisation on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has added to growing speculation over whether the US will strike targets on Venezuelan soil itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said the US \"may be having some discussions with Maduro\" and Maduro responded by saying he would be prepared to talk \"face to face\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the US mulls its next move, the sleepy fishing villages that dot the Caribbean coast wonder whether diplomacy, or war, is on their horizon.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles, he was driven through the night to a military airfield in Louisiana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Majid - not his real name - had fled Iran for the US in October 2024, after repeated detentions and alleged torture, first because of his involvement in the Mahsa Amini protests, and later because of his conversion to Christianity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When US officials forced him to board a plane carrying more than 150 deportees heading to Managua, Nicaragua, he remembers being the only non–Latin American on the plane. Hours later, the flight landed and officials handcuffed him, denied his request for asylum and directed him onto an itinerary routing him through Venezuela and Turkey toward Iran - a journey he understood as a forced return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Majid later was able to go into hiding in Istanbul, terrified of what awaited him back in Iran. He is one of several Iranian Christian converts who spoke to the BBC - most anonymously out of fear for relatives back home - whose asylum claims have been rejected in the past year. Their accounts point to inconsistencies in how US authorities assess the risks facing Iranian returnees and how sensitive religious information in asylum files is handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their experiences also run contrast to other elements of US foreign policy, as President Trump publicly laments the plight of Christian persecutions abroad, threatening to send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if its government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A White House official told the BBC that all individuals deported had their asylum claims fully adjudicated before removal. The official said that recent deportations to Iran involved people with final orders of removal or those who had requested voluntary departure. They added that strict confidentiality rules prevent officials from disclosing whether someone applied for asylum and was denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A rare deportation flight</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the US continues its crackdown on illegal immigration, which was a central plank of Trump's winning re-election campaign, it has made unprecedented changes to its policy towards Iranian asylum seekers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late September, authorities arranged a chartered flight to Iran via Qatar - the first of its kind in decades, given the absence of diplomatic ties and Iran's human-rights record. The flight represented an unusual example of cooperation between Iran and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of Iranians were placed on the flight, reportedly in shackles. One deportee, Sina, later described armed guards escorting passengers on the Qatar–Tehran leg. On arrival, they were questioned about their time in the US and their religious activities but were not immediately arrested, he said in a video, which was posted on a Farsi-language YouTube channel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the passengers was the wife of Ali, an Iranian Christian convert now living in the US. She has since been contacted and summoned by Iranian intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They deported my wife back to Iran even though she is a Christian,\" Ali says - the BBC has given him a pseudonym to protect the identity of him and his wife. \"Now Iranian intelligence is after her and me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ali's wife and others, the danger was heightened by what their lawyers say was a critical mistake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Attorney Ali Herischi, who represents Ali, his wife, and another deportee from the September flight says several clients reported that sensitive information - including statements about religious conversion, political activity and the reasons they sought asylum - was not removed before deportation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5621/live/143f3520-c716-11f0-9197-a502c623b7e9.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Torosian stands in front of the White House gate holding a sign that says: Iranian Christians ran from prison.

But practitioners continue to face persecution, Dew-Jones says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Converting from Islam is treated as apostasy, and converts face arrest, interrogation and prison terms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arrests have increased sixfold between 2023 and 2024, the Center for Human Rights in Iran reports. \"Since the recent Iran–Israel clashes, we've seen the authorities use the term 'Zionist Christianity' even more aggressively. By branding converts as agents of Israel, the state frames ordinary religious practice as a national-security threat,\" Dew-Jones adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Iranians seeking asylum abroad cite conversion as part of their claim, while Iranian officials accuse them of exaggerating or fabricating conversions to strengthen their cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is unclear how many US asylum cases may be exaggerated, versus real fear of persecution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to judge the sincerity of someone's faith - there's no window into people's souls,\" Dew-Jones says. \"Yes, the system can be abused, but we also see many legitimate converts whose testimonies and church records aren't taken seriously by asylum courts.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Life on hold for those left behind</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asylum outcomes can diverge sharply even within a single household, Iranian asylum seekers and legal experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late June, ICE officers arrived at Marjan and Reza's house in Los Angeles.

They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly1ypqlle0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to end the war in Ukraine</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Which brings us back to the peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 28-point proposal, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">which has been widely leaked and reported on,</a> appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

It shot out like a jack in the box.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many. But not everyone.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clymn8zyrp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">on Nato's Article 5</a>. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, though, Russia's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy0yere4k0zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">war on Ukraine continues</a>.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
