Emergency services treated 122 people, with 48, including five children, still in hospital.

and in the context of Donald Trump's repeated threats to annex Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guterres said he believed the founding principles of the UN - including the equality of member states - were now under threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump has previously been scathing in his criticism of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He used his address at last September's General Assembly to question its very purpose, claiming he had \"ended seven unendable wars\" on his own and the UN \"did not even try to help in any of them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Later I realised that the UN wasn't there for us,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Presented with this damning assessment, Guterres admitted his organisation was struggling to make members abide by the international laws laid out in the UN Charter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN was \"extremely engaged\" in solving major global conflicts, he insisted. \"But the UN has no leverage - the big powers have stronger leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He questioned whether that extra leverage was being used to produce real and enduring solutions to those conflicts, or just quick fixes. \"There is a big difference between the two things,\" he noted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guterres also said his organisation needed reform to tackle \"dramatic problems and challenges\" facing its 193 members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are those that believe the power of law should be replaced by the law of power,\" the UN chief said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Indeed, when one sees the present policy of the United States, there is a clear conviction that multilateral solutions are not relevant and that what matters is the exercise of the power and the influence of the United States and sometimes in this respect by the norms of international law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He suggested the UN Security Council -

Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump insists Greenland is critical for US security and has previously said Washington would get the territory \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\". He has not ruled out use of force, which has drawn widespread criticism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new tariffs - taxes on imports - would be imposed on Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK, Trump said on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said an initial 10% tariff would come into force on 1 February \"on any and all goods\" sent to the US, but could rise to 25% in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The levies would \"be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland\", he wrote on his Truth Social platform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their joint statement, the leaders of those eight countries reiterated their \"full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also stressed their commitment to \"strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest\" as members of the Nato military alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement reads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, Frederiksen wrote on Facebook: \"We want to cooperate and we are not the ones seeking conflict. And I am happy for the consistent messages from the rest of the continent: Europe will not be blackmailed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is all the more important that we stand firm on the fundamental values that created the European community.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere on Sunday, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the threat of tariffs was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78ene3221yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"completely wrong\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir, who so far has maintained a strong relationship with Trump, said the UK would be pursuing the matter directly with the White House.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is a sparsely populated but resource-rich. Its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday told NBC News' Meet the Press programme that \"Greenland can only be defended if it is part of the US, and it will not need to be defended if it is part of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe and best for the United States,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC World Service's Newshour programme, Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said mutual respect for sovereignty is a \"non-negotiable\" principle of international law and co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we are to live in peace and if we are to be able to co-operate on shared problems, we have to start by the mutual recognition of each others sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" he added.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"We will not give up\" on constructive dialogue with the US, says Danish Foreign Minister</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is still unclear how the tariffs will affect those Trump has already imposed on the UK and EU. French President Emmanuel Macron, who is working to co-ordinate the European response to the tariff threats, said he would request that the EU activate its \"anti-coercion instrument\" if Trump does impose them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is due to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday on the theme \"how can we co-operate in a more contested world?\" Macron, as well as the leaders of Germany and the EU, will also be attending the annual conference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who will also be there, said his country was \"concerned by the recent escalation\" and that it would be \"significantly increasing Arctic security — strengthening our military and investing in critical infrastructure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Canada strongly believes that the best way to secure the Arctic is by working together within Nato,\" he also wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Nato chief Rutte has said he has spoken to Trump \"regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,\" he added. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04d4/live/b100f2b0-f491-11f0-a665-27642cc33205.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA/Shutterstock People take part in a protest under the slogans 'Hands off Greenland' and 'Greenland for Greenlanders' in Copenhagen, Denmark, 17 January 2026.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA/Shutterstock</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Protests were held over the weekend in both Denmark and Greenland</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public anger in both Denmark and Greenland at Trump's threats over Greenland appears undiminished.

When that did not lead to a sustained upsurge in births, authorities announced that they would allow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57303592\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">up to three children</a> per couple in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has offered parents 3,600 yuan (£375; $500) per each of their children under the age of three. Certain provinces are also dishing out their own baby bonuses, including additional payouts and extended maternity leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of these incentives have stirred controversy. For instance, a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpk7r8w9yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">new 13% tax on contraceptives</a> - including condoms, birth control pills and devices - has sparked concern about unwanted pregnancies and HIV rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, at around one birth per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1. Other economies in the region, such as South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, have similarly low fertility rates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is also one of the most expensive countries in which to raise a child, according to a 2024 report by the YuWa Population Research Institute in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Chinese people have told the BBC they are hindered by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57154574\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">other factors</a> - including the desire for a carefree life without constantly worrying about their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have very few peers who have children, and if they do, they're obsessed about getting the best nanny or enrolling the kids in the best schools. It sounds exhausting,\" a Beijing resident told the BBC in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts at the United Nations believe China's population will continue on a downward trajectory, estimating that the nation will lose more than half of its current population by 2100.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A shrinking population has economic and social implications for the world's second-largest economy: exacerbating an already declining workforce and weak consumer sentiment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With many young people moving away from their parents, there is also a growing number of seniors who are being left to look after themselves or rely on government payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the pension pot is running dry, according to the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences - and the country is running out of time to build enough funds to care for its growing elderly population.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rather than sit in a grand office with big windows overlooking the beautiful Bay of Ajaccio, the club president worked in a windowless, concrete bunker deep inside the building. When I suggested we go for a tour of the town, he categorically said no, it wasn't safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was renowned for his good looks and sing-song southern accent, as well as a passing resemblance to the late actor and showman Yves Montand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his easy going smile could suddenly turn to an eerie silence.  When I asked him if his reputation as the godfather of Corsica was true, he replied: \"Yes, I'm the godfather, but only to my grandchildren.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we talked, surrounded by tough-looking men in leather jackets, boots and jeans, I attempted to crack a joke that fell flat.

Weeks later he was murdered at a petrol station in Ajaccio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, the club had fallen on hard times.

The backflash just happened that quick.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came \"a black rain of smoke\", Gina adds, the heat melting, then shattering, glass lights above people's heads. Gina and her fiance made for the nearest exit, a door to the right of the club's small stage. A bouncer blocked their way, but Gina has no idea why.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's when \"a stampede\" began for the main exit, she says, and Fred desperately pushed her ahead in the crowd. Gina says \"bodies were piling up\" as people scrambled to get out - and her last memory was making it through the door to safety before passing out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When she woke from an induced coma 11 weeks later, Gina learned her fiance had saved her life but had lost his in the fire.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fred Crisostomi and Gina Russo, pictured in 2002.

At The Station nightclub, 100 people died and at Le Constellation, 40, mainly young people, lost their lives. Many survivors of both fires have severe burn injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two disasters have striking similarities, and not only in their appalling impact on victims. Both were caused by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgezqvwr54no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">indoor pyrotechnics</a>, experts say. Victims appear to have had little time to find an escape route, and foam panels may have spread the Swiss fire in an identical way to The Station nightclub fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UK fire investigation consultant Richard Hagger was quick to compare the two tragedies. He is \"99% certain\" the Swiss fire was triggered by the sparklers. He says if the foam had been fire retardant it would have smouldered, not burned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These similarities raise the questions: do we really understand how dangerous such situations are? And what should we do if we find ourselves caught up in one?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A matter of seconds to escape</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In both the Rhode Island and Swiss tragedies, a \"flashover fire\" is thought to have taken hold. This is when hot air rises, but as the heat and smoke reach the ceiling there is nowhere for it to go. So it spreads downwards, quickly igniting furniture, clothes and skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2003, Phil Barr was 22, back home in Rhode Island for a winter break while studying in Maine. He was set on a career on Wall Street, but Phil loved a loud rock band, so going to see Great White that night sounded, well, great.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He got there early and when his friend arrived shortly before show time, Phil grabbed him a beer and excitedly propelled him to the front of the crowd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the fire began, the band's lead singer turned and said, calmly over the PA system: \"Wow, that's not good.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wasn't. Phil describes the moment of the \"flashover\", saying flames quickly \"got overhead, and it was above me\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Phil with his wife in a photo taken last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All of a sudden, everything's on fire, I could sort of see an orange glow, behind heavy black smoke but not much else,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It went from feeling the heat of flame to feeling like your entire body's in an oven.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an attempt to escape, Phil ended up slamming his burning body at a side door and falling out into the snow, and safety. He suffered life-threatening respiratory damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an incredible coincidence, a camera crew from a local TV station was in the club, filming a video about venue safety. Their 12-minute footage of the fire shows it took just 25 seconds for flames to reach the ceiling, and within 90 seconds, toxic smoke had filled the building. With the doorway then blocked by people piling on top of each other and black smoke pouring from the windows, the video suggests leaving straight away gave them the best chance of survival.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ed Galea, one of the world's leading experts on fire and the way people react to it, explains how heat coming from the flammable foam acoustic panels covering the ceiling in The Station nightclub fire made the situation much worse.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f479/live/2fd617c0-f16b-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Ed Galea A graphic showing how the fire spread at The Station nightclub.

You don't have the advantage of the time it takes for the fire to develop. It's already in the ceiling. You've got an instant hot layer and when flashover happens, survivability in any space is unlikely,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the investigation into what happened at The Station nightclub, experts from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology built a laboratory version of the club and set it alight. Their official report found flashover conditions were reached after about 65 seconds. After 90 seconds \"conditions in the middle of the room... were found to be lethal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Galea built on these findings, inputting the layout of The Station club into a computer simulator he created which predicts how fires spread. It showed a rapidly expanding burst of heated air, with temperatures inside the club reaching 700C within 80 seconds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the official investigation into the Swiss disaster is ongoing, footage gathered to date suggests this blaze also engulfed the room in a matter of seconds, spreading across the foam-lined ceiling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities say the fire is believed to have been started by sparklers attached to champagne bottles raised too close to the ceiling during celebrations, and that the bar <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdx4zxk1np0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">had not undergone safety checks for five years</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a51/live/3e502eb0-e808-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"SUPPLIED People hold sparklers attached to champagne bottles in the Swiss ski resort bar just before the fire started - with a small orange patch of fire seen on what looks like a foam ceiling above the sparklers.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">SUPPLIED</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Video from inside Le Constellation appears to show the moment the ceiling covering caught fire</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fire requires three things: heat, fuel and oxygen. And in a fire such as this, there is a window of seconds to make the decision to get out, before the flashover happens, Galea says. But every disaster Prof Galea has studied has convinced him that people underestimate the speed with which fires can spread.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Chance favours the prepared mind'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call it friendly fire syndrome,\" he says. \"We are not exposed to fire on an everyday basis any more, as we used to be 100 years ago when we were experienced at starting fires for cooking. We have lost all of that connection to how rapidly fire can develop.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hagger says \"some people will stand and physically watch the fire, fixated by what they are seeing. They don't physically perceive the danger. Some will film it, some will even try to hide, rather than escaping.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a famous study from 1968, psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley recruited male Columbia University students and asked them to fill in a form while smoke was pumped into the room. The researchers measured how many students stepped out to raise the alarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they were in the room alone, 75% reacted to the smoke by raising the alarm. But when two other people were with them - who were in on the experiment and had been told not to react - just 10% of the subjects reported the possible fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authors concluded that sometimes an \"individual seeing the inaction of others, will judge the situation as less serious than he would be if he were alone\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In The Station fire, crucial seconds passed before both Gina and Phil decided to get out, almost like they were waiting for something to happen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My initial reaction to the fire was, 'Oh, that's interesting',\" Phil says. \"It almost looked like it was just sitting on the surface. It was going to burn out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've been conditioned to believe that there are fire sprinklers or extinguishers nearby, right? I remember thinking at one point, 'We're all going to get wet'.

You don't push,\" Phil adds. But when people realised, \"it just turned into chaos.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gina says it was the fire alarm triggering, which made people react - almost as if they had to be told to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Swiss fire, footage showed some young party-goers filming the early stages of the fire or trying to put out the flames by waving jackets. On social media, some questioned their actions and were criticised for being insensitive. Galea says the way they acted was nothing to do with their age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People are saying, 'It's Gen Z, they don't know what they are doing', but it has been happening ever since I started doing research about this,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has a mantra, which, he says, should guide anyone's thinking when it comes to their safety in a fire: \"Chance favours the prepared mind. You improve your chances by being prepared. Always look for the means of escape.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Preventing another tragedy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to  Galea's decades of research, there have been 38 similar fires claiming about 1,200 lives since the year 2000. Fifteen involved some form of pyrotechnics and about 13 involved acoustic foam or decorative materials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given these precedents, some may wonder why we do not appear to be learning the lessons.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there are shared fire testing specifications, and an industry dedicated to improving safety, there is no internationally enforced \"fire code\". The risk is that a fire in one country does not lead to action to prevent a very similar fire happening in another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the 2017 Grenfell Tower disaster in London, a public inquiry found the London Fire Brigade had been broadly aware of fires involving flammable cladding around the world, but had failed to properly prepare staff to deal with one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compare that with the international aviation industry, which has the advantage of being highly centralised. Air crashes are independently investigated, the findings shared globally, and international directives issued to fix problems, resulting in a good safety record.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gina visits the grave of her former fiance, Fred</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gina and Phil still live with the scars they received in The Station fire.

Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol - known as acetaminophen in the US - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology &amp; Women's Health</a>, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant. This can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth or developmental problems in babies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medical experts not involved in the research have welcomed the study's findings, saying it will help reduce worry among women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Grainne McAlonnan, from King's College London, said expectant mothers \"do not need the stress of questioning whether medicine most commonly used for a headache could have far reaching effects on their child's health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ian Douglas, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the review was \"well-conducted\" because it excluded studies of lower quality, where no account was taken of important differences between mothers who use or don't use paracetamol during pregnancy, such as underlying illnesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Prof Jan Haavik, molecular neuroscientist and clinical psychiatrist at the University of Bergen, the study provides \"strong evidence\" that use of paracetamol during pregnancy does not increase the risk of autism, ADHD or intellectual disability and \"should effectively put this question to rest\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is widely believed by scientists working in this field that autism is the result of a complex mix of factors, including genetic and environmental ones.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab21/live/1a41ded0-f2f1-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images US President Donald Trump talks into a microphone in the White House, with Robert F.

In fact, it's so outlandish that they may indeed be more baffled than angry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nobody in the world would assume that a threat like this - based on acquiring the land of your ally - would ever actually happen. Does Trump really have the backing in the US, in Congress, even in his own administration to do this?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Is this, as some trade officials have to assume, the biggest TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) of all time? These things can come and go and, economically, these countries have handled the damage so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Greenland: 'Diplomatic channels are the way to go', US speaker tells BBC</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Think of Canada. It has seen its trade with the US slump. But its Prime Minister Mark Carney's strategy has seen Canada's trade surge with the rest of the world by 14% - which amazingly is worth more than what was needed to cover its trade lost with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm24k6kk1rko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">been in China this week</a> pushing \"a new world order\" and pursuing more trade with China, not the detachment sought by some US administration officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is China versus the world,\" the Trump administration was trying to persuade the rest of the world just three months ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney is showing up this approach, something which is perhaps notable background context for the timing of today's intervention.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If, however, we do take Trump's latest threats seriously, they are extremely troubling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not so much because of the 10% tariff, but because of its rationale - taking land from an ally, and the act of publicly trying to coerce your allies. How would the world react if China or Russia had sent a threat like this to some of their allies?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The basis of the threat is clearly deeply worrying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in capitals around the world will read Trump's social media announcement and question the functioning of American decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump arrives to meet leaders of the allied countries whose economies he has just threatened at the World Economic Forum on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the world will hope that, by that time, this unparalleled threat will have somehow disappeared.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"are-you-in-greenland?-share-your-perspective.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Are you in Greenland?

He is crying, begging for his father's help.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's so hard to hear. Hearing his voice hurts me,\" Musa told BBC Africa Eye, which was given exclusive access to a police unit that helped him as he searched for two of his children who had fallen victim to scammers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was in February 2024 that Musa's 22-year-old son and 18-year-old daughter, along with five others, were recruited from their remote village in the Faranah region of central Guinea by agents promising them work abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The jobs never materialised and the so-called recruiters turned out to be human traffickers. The group was taken across the border into Sierra Leone and held captive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My heart is broken. I can't stop crying. If you look at my eyes, you can see the pain,\" Musa said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His case was picked up by the global policing agency Interpol in Guinea, which asked their unit in Sierra Leone to help. So last August Musa, travelled to Makeni, in central Sierra Leone, in a bid to find them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of people across West Africa are being lured by a human trafficking scam, commonly known as QNET.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Founded in Hong Kong, QNET itself is a legitimate wellness and lifestyle company - it allows people to sign up to buy their products and sell them online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-64151759\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Its business model has faced some criticism</a> - however in West Africa, criminal gangs are using its name as a front for their illegal activities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The traffickers target people with the promise of work opportunities in places like the US, Canada, Dubai and Europe, asking them to pay large sums of money for administration costs before they start the job.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once they have paid, they are often trafficked to a neighbouring country and told they can only travel abroad once they recruit others into the scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even when they bring in family and friends, the jobs never materialise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://africa.qnet.net/opportunity/compliance-articles/qnet-against-scams-senegal/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">QNET itself has a campaign running across the region</a>, involving billboards and media adverts.

Travelling to Sierra Leone himself was his last hope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmoud Conteh, the head of investigations at the anti-trafficking unit of Interpol within the Sierra Leone police, said the case was a priority for his unit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's very easy for these traffickers to manoeuvre across each of our borders at these illegal crossing points,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Conteh received a tip-off that a large number of young people were being held in a location in Makeni, Musa joined the police as they raided the property, hoping to find his children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bags and clothes were strewn across the floors. It is thought 10 to 15 people slept in each room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Interpol team gathered everyone inside the property and found some as young as 14 had been living there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The majority are Guineans. There is only one Sierra Leonean among them. All the rest are Guineans,\" said Conteh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musa's children were not among them, though one young man said they had been there the previous week - the first potential sighting of his children in a year.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most of those found in the house in Makeni were from Guinea</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group were transferred to the police station for screening before 19 of them were taken home to Guinea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police say they have conducted more than 20 raids like this over the past year, rescuing hundreds of victims of human trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Often victims have been moved by the traffickers across borders, but others, like 23-year-old Aminata, a Sierra Leonean whose name has been changed to protect her identity, are trafficked within their own countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on a plastic chair with the slopes of Makeni's Wusum Hills behind her in the distance, Aminata told the BBC how a friend had introduced her to people claiming to represent QNET in mid-2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was successful in an interview and was told she would go on a course before flying to the US for further study and work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only catch was she had to pay $1,000 to join the scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Convinced it was legitimate, her family gave her the money they had saved for her college fees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When they first recruit you, they feed you, they take care of you. But as time goes by, they stop,\" she told the BBC, going on to say this is when she had to go the \"extra mile\" to survive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have to sell your body and go sleep with men so that you can get money - so you can take care of yourself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aminata said she was told that if she wanted to travel, she had to recruit other people into the scheme.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To do this, the traffickers gave her an international number to make it look like she was already abroad when she contacted them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They take you to the airport and you dress well like you're about to travel. They give you a passport, give you fake travel papers,\" she explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Then they take your photo so you can send them to your friends and family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aminata managed to persuade six friends and relatives to join the scheme, still hoping the job in the US would materialise.

US officials say they are targeting the \"worst of the worst\" but critics warn migrants with no criminal record and US citizens are being detained, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could be anybody,\" says Sunshine, as she drives around her neighbourhood, St Paul - one of the so-called Twin Cities, along with Minneapolis.

But at times there have been clashes, with the authorities deploying tear gas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents toward peaceful protesters in Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Judge Katherine Menendez said federal agents <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgprwlplqwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrators</a>, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has vowed to press on with his mass deportation drive in Minnesota, with thousands of federal agents deployed to the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of them were sent in the aftermath of the fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman, Renée Good, 37, by an ICE agent on 7 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7yv4524gqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">circumstances surrounding her death remain contested</a>, with the Trump administration saying the ICE agent who shot her acted in self-defence, while local officials argue the woman was attempting to leave and posed no danger. The FBI is investigating the shooting, but officials in Minnesota say they have been denied access to evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Good's killing has focused the minds of many members of this community who are determined to reverse Trump's campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her car, Sunshine spots two unmarked vehicles with darkened windows containing ICE agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We follow them to a nearby neighbourhood, where the two cars proceed to drive slowly and repeatedly around the block in circles, in what is seemingly a diversion tactic to take Sunshine away from a shopping centre immigrants often use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the game.

Lang had vowed to burn a Quran outside City Hall, however it is not clear if he carried out his plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US, the majority of whom are US citizens.

Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A self-conscious sandwich generation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Popularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities. They were health-conscious, active and comfortable with technology—an important target demographic for companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the past, people in their 40s were seen as already old,\" says Kim Yong-Sup, a trend analyst widely credited with coining the term \"Young 40\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the median age of South Korea's society rose, however, these people were \"no longer on the verge of old age but at the centre of society\", he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the marketing term has since taken a viral, sardonic turn. Over the past year, \"Young 40\" was mentioned online more than 100,000 times - more than half the references<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>were used in a negative context, according to analytics platform SomeTrend.

He has also referred to Canada as \"the 51st state\" - a jab that has been met with a mix of anxiety and an uncharactaristically fierce display of patriotism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has had an effect not just on how Canadians shop and travel, but on the country's domestic politics and world view. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here are five ways Trump has had an impact on Canada. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A shift in how Canadians see the US</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the relationship between the two countries has had its ups and downs, many Canadians shop, travel and even work in the US, and have family ties to the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the past 12 months has seen a change in Canadians' overall attitudes towards the US, if not towards Americans themselves. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/07/24/canadians-opinions-of-the-us-and-its-president-are-at-or-near-historic-lows/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Polling conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> last spring indicated that 64% of Canadians held a negative view of the US in 2025 - the highest ever recorded in more than two decades of polling by Pew. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a reversal from how they felt before the second Trump administration, when the majority said they held a favourable view of their neighbour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survey suggested an even larger percentage of Canadians, around 77%, lack confidence in Trump as a president. Nine in 10 respondents described him as \"arrogant\" and three-quarters said they believe he is \"dangerous\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://angusreid.org/carney-asia-trade-apec-asean-korea-malaysia-singapore/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">separate Angus Reid poll</a> from October suggested nearly half of Canadians (46%) want their government to approach the US as an \"enemy or potential threat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is higher than for India (24%) or China (34%). Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has sought to improve the relationship with both of those countries after years of tensions related, among other issues, to allegations of foreign interference. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://leger360.com/in-the-news-us-intervention-in-venezuela-raises-alarm-in-canada/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">recent Leger poll</a> conducted earlier this month indicates that one in three Canadians believe the US could take \"direct action\" to control Canada in the future. The poll was in response to the US seizure this month of former Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and Trump's renewed comments on annexing Greenland.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Fewer trips south</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long been the number one travel destination for Canadians - an unsurprising statistic given the proximity of two countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it remains a top destination, the number of Canadians making trips south has dropped by more than 25%, according to the latest data by Statistics Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That decline has been noticed by the American tourism industry, which forecast a loss of $5.7bn (£4.3bn) in tourism spending in 2025 compared to the previous year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some jurisdictions, like California, have even <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6whrOPdfts\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">run advertisements</a> to try to entice Canadians back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many have opted to vacation at home, with the domestic tourism sector reporting a record-breaking C$59bn ($42bn) in revenues from May to August, up 6% from the same period last year, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others have gone to Mexico, with national data showing a 12% surge in Canadians visiting Mexican cities in the last year.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">'Come hug it out!' -

an exit hastened in part by his finance minister publicly quitting in protest over his handling of Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That made way for Carney, a former central banker with political ambitions, to run for the party's leadership. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney leaned heavily on his economic experience as he campaigned as the man who could stand up to Trump and voters, anxious about Canada's sovereignty and economy in the face of the new US administration, flocked back to the Liberals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In late April's election, Carney achieved what was unthinkable just a few months prior: another return to power for the Liberals, with voters giving the party a few seats shy of a majority government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Conservatives, meanwhile, lost their fourth consecutive election and Poilievre faces a leadership review later this month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://338canada.com/federal.htm\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest polling</a> indicates that Carney's Liberals are a few points ahead of the Conservatives, though the gap between them has narrowed.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/aaaa/live/aaa7ad20-f3ae-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney smiles as he shakes hands with President of China Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

The trip would be a further thawing of Canada-India relations, which have been icy since Trudeau openly accused Indian agents of being behind the extra-judicial killing of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past year, Carney has also made trips to the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as a number of European countries, in search for new trade relationships. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"what-questions-do-you-have-about-trump's-first-year-since-returning-as-president?\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">What questions do you have about Trump's first year since returning as president? </i><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u227284793\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"click-here\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Click here</i></a><i id=\"or-use-the-form-below.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> or use the form below.</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

the son of the president and his potential successor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Veteran figures from the party's old guard were pushed aside, replaced by newer faces, many without the credentials of having fought in the war that brought Museveni to power 40 years ago, but widely seen as loyal to his son. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to sources close to the presidency, authority at State House has become increasingly decentralised, with decisions once taken directly by Museveni now channelled through a tight inner circle of relatives and long-time associates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Museveni's day-to-day schedule is said to be overseen by his eldest daughter, Natasha Karugire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relations with foreign dignitaries and senior military figures are largely managed by his half-brother, Salim Saleh, while trade and economic policy are shaped by his son-in-law, Odrek Rwabwogo, married to Museveni's second daughter, Patience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And for the first time in the country's modern history, all security matters - both internal and external - are overseen by the chief of defence forces, the 51-year-old Gen Kainerugaba. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the dominant role that the military has long played in Ugandan politics and the fact that Museveni himself came to power through armed struggle, this concentration of authority in his hands has profound political implications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It suggests that Uganda's future is being shaped -

The other, called the \"Gaza Executive Board\", is responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That committee is made up of supposedly technocratic, apolitical Palestinians, led by Dr Ali Shaath, a civil engineer by training who's held ministerial positions in the Palestinian Authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But of the seven members of the founding Executive Board, six are Americans - including US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other members of Trump's inner circle like his son-in-law Jared Kushner, and Steve Witkoff, who is US Special Envoy to the Middle East, but also a friend of the president and a fellow real estate developer.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ajay Banga, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct7x6q\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">president of the World Bank</a>, is something of an exception as an Indian-born US citizen. Sir Tony Blair, meanwhile, is a former UK Prime Minister, and his inclusion is likely to further fuel concerns about how the Board of Peace will operate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past few weeks, criticism of Sir Tony's possible inclusion has come from figures like prominent politician Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative, and newspaper reports quoting unnamed officials from Arab states in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Tony's central role in the Iraq war, coupled with Britain's own colonial history in the Middle East, is deemed by his opponents to make him entirely unsuitable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Francesca Albanese, the United Nations' special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, wrote on social media last year: \"Tony Blair? Hell no. Hands off Palestine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Trump seemed to acknowledge the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he's an acceptable choice to everybody,\" the president said last October.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is significant overlap between the two senior boards, with Kushner, Witkoff and Sir Tony appearing on both.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Gaza Executive Board does include the names of some senior political figures and diplomats from Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It will be headed by the former Bulgarian politician, Nickolay Mladenov, who's been given the title of High Representative for Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus is the only Israeli member.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its statement announcing the names, the White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And whatever the concerns and complexities, the plan remains the only game in town, with many world leaders pledging their support and commitment to helping make it a success.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its architecture is further complicated by the fact that, sitting above all the structures announced so far, will be the Board of Peace itself, with President Trump as the chairman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Names of that supreme body have not yet been announced, but <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79rqd947vzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the current UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer</a>, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Egypt's Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and Canadian leader Mark Carney have reportedly been invited to join.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, whether the most vocal critics can be assuaged will depend on how quickly the new members of the senior teams can begin to drive change that makes a real difference in both daily life for Palestinians and, crucially, further concrete steps towards a lasting peace.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5f24/live/d5fe4790-f39a-11f0-9212-79f406d84709.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images In an aerial view, people walk amid the destruction in Gaza City in the northern Gaza Strip.

It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Showing meaningful progress towards rebuilding will also be a Herculean task, involving not only the removal of an estimated 60 million tonnes of rubble, but first finding and disposing of the dead bodies and unexploded bombs contained within it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps the biggest challenge though is maintaining the fraying ceasefire itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another name has been released by the White House, that of Major General Jasper Jeffers as the Commander of the International Stabilization Force (ISF). </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Backed by a UN mandate, it will have the tough job of ensuring the demilitarisation of Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As yet, there's no clear road map for how Hamas will be persuaded to give up its weapons, nor any clear idea of which country will provide troops for that force or what its remit and rules of engagement will be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas has said it will only disarm as part of a wider deal establishing a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel, whose ground troops still control more than half of the Gaza Strip, has said it will only withdraw if Hamas disarms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How that catch-22 can be resolved is perhaps the biggest test of all.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
