The BBC has contacted the White House for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It comes as US forces have been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In total, there have been more than 30 strikes on vessels as part of the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93n4nx5yqro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump administration's \"war on drugs\" </a>, with more than 110 people killed since the US carried out its first attack on a boat in international waters on 2 September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdq1ple2l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">latest attack came on Wednesday</a> when two boats alleged to be carrying drugs were struck, killing five people on board, according to the US military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Trump said the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8484p7ggmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US had carried out a strike on a \"dock area\"</a> linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats, causing a \"major explosion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The blast was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also been cracking down on <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g562vz34ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sanctioned oil tankers </a>entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ed Habershon / BBC A head and shoulders image of a smiling Christy Chitengu.

It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being.

It also reported the three deaths in Azna, in neighbouring Lorestan province, without specifying if there were protesters or security officials. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rights group Hengaw said the two killed in Lordegan were protesters, naming them as Ahmad Jalil and Sajjad Valamanesh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has not been able to independently verify the deaths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately state media said a member of the security forces linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) was killed in clashes with protesters on Wednesday<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>night in the city of Kouhdasht, in the western Lorestan province. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has not been able to verify this and protesters say the man was one of their number and was shot dead by the security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A further 13 police officers and Basij members were injured by stone throwing in the area, the state media report said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schools, universities and public institutions were closed across the country on Wednesday after a bank holiday was declared by authorities in an apparent effort to quell the unrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was ostensibly to save energy because of the cold weather, though it was seen by many Iranians as an attempt to contain the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They began in Tehran - among shopkeepers angered by another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the US dollar on the open market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By Tuesday, university students were involved and they had spread to several cities, with people chanting against the country's clerical rulers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who was accused by morality police of not wearing her veil properly. But they have not been on the same scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To prevent any escalation, tight security is now reported in the areas of Tehran where the demonstrations began.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his government will listen to the \"legitimate demands\" of the protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the prosecutor general, Mohammad Movahedi-Azad, has also warned that any attempt to create instability would be met with what he called a \"decisive response\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

The building occupies 13,356 square metres (143,800 sq ft), the equivalent of about two football pitches, with a total floor area of 53,464 square metres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the administration is serious about promoting women's empowerment, I believe we can count on their understanding and cooperation,\" Komiyama said, according to Japanese media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chair of the Lower House committee Yasukazu Hamada has \"expressed a willingness\" to consider the proposal for more women's toilets, said an Asahi Shimbun report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Japanese government earlier set a target of having 30% of leadership roles across all sectors of society held by women by 2020, but at the end of that year the timeframe was quietly pushed back by a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women currently hold nearly 16% of the seats in the Lower House and about a third – or 42 out of 125 seats – in the Upper House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader in October last year, had pledged to raise female representation in her cabinet to levels comparable to Nordic countries, which hold the top spots in terms of female leadership.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she has appointed just two other women to her 19-member cabinet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Japan, the dearth of women's restrooms extends beyond the legislative chamber.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Long lines in front of women's public restrooms are a common sight nationwide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had said his government would look into \"enhancing women's restroom facilities\" to make Japan a society where \"women can live their lives with peace of mind\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was a scan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbaella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\".

Steve Harrington and Dustin Henderson, and said they couldn't have been more pleased with how it all ended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's been basically 10 years,\" Liv told BBC News, wearing Harrington's Scoops Ahoy ice cream shop uniform outside the theatre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Duffer Brothers did a good job of giving the audience what we needed, maybe not necessarily what we wanted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They both applauded the both happy-at-times and perhaps, bittersweet ending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an emotional roller-coaster,\" Alina added, noting Eleven's up-for-interpretation-ending was perfectly done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was just a lot of emotions,\" Diana Espinoza told the BBC, standing in the lobby of the theatre with a new Demogorgon plush.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I lost control of my tears!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She donned a lengthy mind-flayer dress to the screening and said she'd attempted in vain to steer clear of various fan theories that have been going viral on social media because she wanted to be \"blown away\" by the final episode. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being in a theatre with fellow fans screaming and crying during pivotal scenes was the cherry on top.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I loved the finale. There was no better way to end this,\" she said, calling it both bittersweet, emotional and the \"happy ending\" that everyone deserved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-steven-mcintosh.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Steven McIntosh.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC's Steve Rosenberg asks Russians what they are hoping for in 2026</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78v5dj3x39o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">secure full control of the industrial area</a> in any peace agreement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z615y443o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security guarantees for 15 years</a> - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Russian Defence Ministry A Russian defence ministry official sits in front of a large screen which shows a map, marked with the the alleged flight paths of the drones Russia says Ukraine launched at one of Putin's residences.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Russian Defence Ministry</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming -

Earlier, Italy's foreign minister said identification would be difficult due to the severe burns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People from several countries are believed to be involved. The Italian Foreign Ministry has told the BBC that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, and between 12 and 15 others are receiving treatment in hospital.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three Italian nationals - a woman in her twenties and two boys under 16 - were being taken to Milan to be treated at Niguarda hospital's major burns unit, local councillor Guido Bertolaso said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French foreign ministry said eight of its citizens were missing and that it could not rule out that French nationals were among the dead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French media earlier reported that at least two of the injured are French nationals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French football club FC Metz said one of its youth players was \"severely burned\" in the fire. Tahirys Dos Santos, 19, has been airlifted to a hospital in Germany for treatment, the club said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Emmanuel Macron said France was \"ready to provide any assistance\" and that people injured in the fire were welcome to be treated in French hospitals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU is also providing medical assistance to the victims, the bloc's President Ursula von der Leyen said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK embassy in Switzerland says it is monitoring the situation but it has not been approached for assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consular staff are on standby to support any British nationals affected, a Foreign Office statement said.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What caused the fire? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cause is currently unknown but authorities say initial evidence does not suggest an attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about earlier reports of an explosion, regional security official Stéphane Ganzer said it \"is not the detonation of an explosive device that causes the fire, it is the fire which, as it develops, causes an explosion and a general conflagration of the premises\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two French nationals who said they were in the bar at the time described seeing a waitress put a birthday candle on top of a champagne bottle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One of the candles was held too close to the ceiling, which caught fire. In a matter of seconds, the entire ceiling was ablaze. Everything was made of wood.\" Emma and Albane told French media outlet BFMTV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They described the evacuation as \"very difficult\" because the escape route was \"narrow\" and the stairs to get outside \"even narrower\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a news conference on Thursday, Ms Pilloud also said the staircases appeared to be narrow, but investigations will assess whether they were in line with requirements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regional police commander Frédéric Gisler said smoke was first seen emanating from a bar at around 01:30 local time, at which point emergency services were called. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first police officers were quickly on the scene followed by a major deployment of rescue teams, Mr Gisler said. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Video shows moment Swiss bar fire appears to start</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What do we know about Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Le Constellation is a large bar in the the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana which has been around for many years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the resort itself is quite upmarket, Le Constellation was not particularly posh, the BBC's Silvia Costeloe reported from the resort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Upstairs, there is an area with TV screens where people go to watch football matches. Downstairs is a big bar where people were likely drinking and dancing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It could hold up to 300 people and had a small terrace, although it is unknown how many people were there at the time of the fire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Christmas and New Year holidays are one of the busiest times of the year for Alpine ski resorts, and it is likely the bar was full of Swiss people and tourists celebrating the start of 2026. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A promotional video posted on YouTube for Le Constellation bar,  published in May 2024, showed women in motorcycle helmets walking through the bar while carrying sparklers in alcohol bottles above their heads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The caption, written in French, read: \"The Constellation Crans-Montana welcomes you every day from 9am to 2am, 365 days a year without interruption.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4e33/live/57ee0ac0-e70b-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Police Cantonale Valaisanne  Image shows the terrace of Le Constellation bar.

Visiting food trucks to discuss how city permitting processes have led to \"Halalflation\". Walking the length of Manhattan to show New Yorkers they \"deserve a mayor that they can see, they can hear, they can even yell at\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those social media videos helped propel Zohran Mamdani and his left-wing policies to a surprise win in New York City's mayoral primary, and then to victory in the November election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The democratic socialist, 34, engaged New Yorkers - particularly young voters who spend much of their time \"doom-scrolling\" – by using social media to build an image of someone who is authentic and joyful, experts told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, after he was sworn in as mayor on 1 January, his next challenge will be keeping those same supporters engaged and maintaining the momentum in office.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After becoming the first New York mayor to take the oath of office with his hand on a Quran, Mamdani told thousands gathered to watch his inauguration ceremony in freezing weather that he would represent everyone in the city.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do not stand alone. I stand alongside you,\" he said, adding: \"I promise you this: If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About three-quarters of New York City voters under the age of 30 voted for Mamdani, according to an Associated Press voter poll.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's robust social media strategy engaged these voters by delivering an image of a political candidate that young people - frustrated with older, more established candidates - craved, said Jane Hall, a communications professor at American University who studies politics and the media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A candidate does not have to be young to connect with young voters, Hall said, \"but I think you have to be seen as being authentic and speaking to what people care about in a way that is hip and makes people want to be on the bandwagon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jack Bratich, a journalism professor at Rutgers University who studies political culture and social media, said Mamdani has shown he is able to combine a lightheartedness with serious conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sense of fun stands in contrast to some of the negativity that President Donald Trump has leaned into on social media, Jennifer Stromer-Galley, who teaches communications, political science, and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media in the Oval Office\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The pair had a warm first meeting at the White House in November</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqd42gl0qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">unexpectedly friendly first meeting</a> in November between the two politicians, where they said they agreed on a number of issues facing New York City, such as the affordability crisis, the pair locked horns during the mayoral race. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump painted Mamdani as an extremist \"lunatic\", threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won, and said he would have him arrested if he stood in the way of immigration enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On election night, Mamdani snapped back in his victory speech, telling the president \"to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That comment prompted a raucous cheer from his supporters at the time, but experts say the reality of governing may mean engaging with the Trump administration in a pragmatic way. That warm meeting in November may have been an early sign that Mamdani is willing to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How he works with the White House - and the kind of relationship he cultivates with the president - could prove crucial for implementing his agenda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it may be easy to promise \"fast, sweeping change\" in campaign videos, things become much more difficult when it comes to actually \"governing under a hostile administration\", said Ioana Literat, a Columbia University communications professor who studies youth online political socialisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If his [social media] content doesn't reckon honestly with those constraints, the same young people who made him go viral can just as quickly turn that energy into disillusionment or backlash,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zohran Mamdani: From immigrant roots to mayor of New York City</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To succeed in office Mamdani will need to keep his supporters engaged with day-to-day governing - and that is not as thrilling as a high-stakes political race, Jonathan Nagler, co-director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's easy to mobilise people to oppose Trump. They already disagree with Trump on so many things, if we're talking about New York City voters,\" Nagler said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's much harder to do is to go on social media and say: \"Hey, the New York City Council is in my way. I need you to get riled up about convincing the New York City Council to do something\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nagler added that it could be a challenge to educate some of those voters about how city government works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Like all election campaigns, the transition to governance via media is tricky,\" Rutgers Prof Bratich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One strategy for keeping the momentum of his campaign could be to turn his captive social media followers into active grassroots organisers. After all, social media \"was the front door into a huge field operation and youth volunteer corps\" for the mayor-elect, Braitch said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's posts during the campaign consistently directed followers toward protests, canvassing events, registration drives, and other forms of active participation - ultimately producing more than 100,000 volunteers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if his administration stumbles and the feeds keep promising more than he can deliver, it could harden a sense among young voters that 'even the internet's mayor couldn't change anything,'\" Literat said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That broader reputational risk is part of what makes his governing-era social media so consequential,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is at least one major sign that that the grassroots momentum surrounding Mamdani will continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, his allies announced a new advocacy group that aims to use his deep well of volunteers to raise funds for his agenda. The nonprofit, Our Time for an Affordable NYC, was founded by Mamdani volunteers and members of the Democratic Socialists of New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Our Time is legally separate from Mamdani and his transition team, the group says it is focused on pushing forward the mayor-elect's affordability agenda through \"door-knocking, phone-banking, communicating, and organising at the neighbourhood, city, and state level\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's swearing-in ceremony on Thursday took place inside the original City Hall subway station, which is now abandoned for regular transit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,\" he said. \"I cannot wait to see everyone tomorrow as we begin our term.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Knowing their benefits would expire, the family stockpiled the drug to survive the first few months of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be like paying two mortgage payments,\" she said of the new monthly price for healthcare. \"We can't pay $30,000 for insurance a year.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Martin and her family are not the only ones facing this conundrum. Millions of Americans will see their healthcare bills skyrocket when these subsidies, which were provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare,  expire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle attempted to extend these subsidies into 2026, but Washington was gridlocked. A vote in the new year could offer hope, but until then, many like Ms Martin will have to live without insurance or see their bills steeply increase.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 24 million Americans buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, and the majority were used to receiving tax credits to lower the monthly price.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those tax credits, also referred to as subsidies, were first introduced through former President Barack Obama's ACA in 2014. They were then expanded during Covid. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fight to extend the subsidies became the centre of the longest government shutdown in US history, which went on for more than 40 days earlier this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats wanted to force Republicans to extend the subsidies for an additional three years, which would cost $35bn per year. Republicans did not want the government to foot the bill for another three years of subsidies without spending cuts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891nvwvg2zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">weeks-long shutdown</a> - which left millions without essential government services - ended when a group of Democratic senators agreed to reopen the government, if Republicans in the Senate agreed to vote on extending the subsidies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that vote still hasn't happened yet, despite efforts from Democrats and four Republicans to put the issue to Congress before the subsidies expired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am pissed for the American people,\" New York Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican who pushed to save the subsidies, said. \"Everybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to their constituents. You know what is funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the subsidies, the monthly cost of healthcare could rise by 114% on average, according to health research non-profit KFF.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maddie Bannister is among the Americans bracing for that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The California mother, who just had her second child, was paying $124 a month for her family of three in 2025. Now, with a new baby and no ACA subsidies, she is preparing to pay $908 a month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So many people are going to choose to be uninsured because it's cheaper to pay a penalty for being uninsured than it is to have healthcare,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ms Bannister's family, the increased cost of healthcare means putting off other spending: \"We were saving for a home, and saving money for that is going to take way longer if we have to spend $11,000 a year on healthcare that we barely use.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Ms Bannister is stomaching her new bill, and Ms Martin is going without healthcare, others are resorting to different government programmes to get their coverage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, Stephanie Petersen used Medicaid - a healthcare program for lower-income Americans - to get healthcare coverage. Just recently, she was able to switch and get her coverage through the ACA - a welcome change for the 38-year-old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because her health care is skyrocketing from $75 to $580 a month, she is returning to Medicaid coverage in the New Year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm trying to stay optimistic but the way things have been going, I'm not hopeful,\" the Illinois resident said. \"Everyone should have affordable, good healthcare, and not have to jump through all these hoops.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A vote on the three-year extension of the ACA subsidies is now expected the week of 5 January when Congress returns to Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until then, Ms Martin will be one of the more than 27 million Americans without health insurance in 2026. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number that is likely to grow, experts warn, as healthcare costs increase. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not low-income people, we make decent money, but we can't afford $30,000 a year for insurance, that's crazy,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've done everything we're supposed to do, we've worked our whole lives, we work hard, and we just get screwed.

But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine.

Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU.

Black-browed albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird-scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird-scaring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird-scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird-scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird-scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
