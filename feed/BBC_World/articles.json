He even spoke up against me and my decisions as a minister. He was a pure example of who we should be,\" added McKenzie. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leader of South African's Build One party Mmusi Maimane said the \"brazen murder of DJ Warras in broad daylight is a shock for all South Africans\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"DJ Warras was more than just a face of a reality series.

Nothing, zero, nothing\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the other figures that Wiles commented on was JD Vance, a one-time critic of Trump who has since become a close ally and vice-president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles suggested that Vance's shift in perceptions was \"sort of political\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Vance said he had not read the article, but that he only believes in conspiracy theories that are \"true\" - citing reports of former President Joe Biden's ill-health as an example. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her strongest comments were reserved for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge - before leaving the government in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly thereafter, Musk and Trump had a public spat that saw the two men trade barbs and insults over social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles described Musk as an \"avowed Ketamine [user]\" who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB\", the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" she said. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking back on Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Wiles said that she was against the gutting of the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, saying she was \"initially aghast\" at the idea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she recalled. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"With that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning - hours after the Vanity Fair article was published - Wiles took to X, accusing the magazine of a \"disingenuously framed hit piece\" aimed at her, Trump and other cabinet members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When contacted for comment on the story, the White House also defended Wiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to the BBC, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt added. \"The entire administration is grateful to her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing later in the day, Leavitt accused Vanity Fair of \"bias of omission\" by excluding other interviews conducted with White House staff and taking Wiles' words \"wildly out of context\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk has yet to comment on the Vanity Fair piece. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Senator John Kennedy, a Republican representing Louisiana, said he thought Trump should not have made the comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think a wise man once said nothing. Why? Because he was a wise man,\" Kennedy said. \"I think President Trump should have said nothing. I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reiner was a lifelong Democrat and prominent liberal activist, and frequently spoke out against Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2017, for example, he called Trump \"mentally unfit\" for office. And as recently as October, Reiner said he believed Trump was ushering in an age of \"full-on autocracy\" in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hours after his social media post, Trump repeated his thoughts on Reiner in comments given in the Oval Office to reporters, describing the director as a \"deranged person\" who was partly \"behind\" previous claims of collusion between Russia and Trump's team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all, in any way, shape or form,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has in the past criticised political foes after their death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the death of Arizona Senator John McCain - with whom he clashed regularly - in 2019, for example, Trump said he \"was never a fan\" and \"never will be\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another incident the same year, Trump quipped that the late Democratic lawmaker John Dingell could be \"looking up\" at him from the grave, a comment which was widely interpreted as a suggestion that Dingell was in hell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement following the remarks about Dingell, the White House said that the president was \"just riffing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reiner, who was 78, was known for directing several iconic films in a variety of genres, including This is Spinal Tap, Stand By Me, Misery and A Few Good Men.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He married Michele, an actress, photographer and producer, in 1989, later recalling that they met during the making of one of his best-known films, When Harry Met Sally. The couple had three children together - including Nick, 32.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Michele, 68, owned the Reiner Light photography agency and production house.</p></div></div></body></html>"

some legal experts say breach the law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clan del Golfo is the latest Latin American criminal group to be added to the US Treasury's list of FTOs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has been engaging in criminal activities for decades, mainly trafficking cocaine from Colombia - the largest producer of the drug - to destinations in the US and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Clan del Golfo, which is based in the northern Urabá region of Colombia, also plays a key role in smuggling migrants through the Darién Gap, the expanse of jungle linking Colombia to Panama. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement announcing its designation as an FTO, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the group was also behind terrorist attacks against public officials, law enforcement and military personnel, and civilians in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is estimated to have thousands of members and is thought to be the largest cocaine-trafficking gang currently operating in Colombia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It joins three other Colombian criminal groups on the list of FTOs: the left-wing guerrilla group National Liberation Army (ELN), and two groups which broke away from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - a Marxist guerrilla force - when it signed a peace agreement with the Colombian government in 2016.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FTO designation of the Clan del Golfo by the US comes less than a fortnight after Colombia's President, Gustavo Petro,

President Nicolás Maduro, whom he accuses of leading another group the US has designated as an FTO: the Cartel of the Suns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But asked by journalists about his plans for Venezuela on Friday, he not only again invoked the possibility of attacking drug smugglers on land but also appeared to hint at the possibility of doing so in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Colombia has at least three cocaine factories. That's a different country,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And later he added: \"But it's not only land strikes on Venezuela, it's land strikes on horrible people that are bringing in drugs and killing our people.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has argued that the strikes on the alleged drug boats are saving US lives by preventing the powerful opioid fentanyl from reaching the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fentanyl abuse has triggered one of the worst public health emergencies to hit the US, with more than 110,000 drug-related deaths in the US in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the number of fatal drug overdoses fell by 25% in 2024, tackling this crisis remains one of Trump's priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said that every strike on an alleged drug boat \"saves 25,000 American lives\" but US officials have provided no evidence that any of the vessels they struck carried fentanyl, which is 50 times as powerful as heroin and much deadlier than cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counternarcotics experts have pointed out that neither Colombia nor Venezuela produce fentanyl and have questioned the Trump administration's focus on those countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The executive order Trump signed on Monday classifying fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction\" suggests he may be engaging in a twin-track approach, continuing to target boats suspected of carrying cocaine as well as expanding his administration's powers to fight fentanyl-smuggling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the move has been met with criticism by Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Mexican leader insisted that the causes of drug use must be addressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that fentanyl was also used legally in hospitals for pain relief and questioned what the unintended effects of the classification of fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction would be.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Russia mostly occupies the region and it wants Kyiv to hand it over in its entirety, which Ukraine is staunchly refusing to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US officials said Washington was now willing to submit a security package for Senate ratification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Zelensky and European leaders, describing it as a \"very good talk\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever,\" he said, referring to reaching a peace deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who hosted the discussions, struck a similar tone earlier on Monday, saying \"this is the first time a ceasefire is conceivable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a huge progress which I welcome very much,\" he said, describing Washington's security guarantees as \"remarkable\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several European leaders, as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, will join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal which Ukraine presented to the US last week, to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide it with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend more than a million Ukrainian households were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. Zelensky said on Monday that there was not a \"single functioning power station\" that had not been attacked by the Russians. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98nnd01g91o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets</a> held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An apple in hand, she said she started queuing around 11:00 local time on Sunday – nearly a full day before the session – because dozens of people had come before her. It was a cold night, she said, but she did it because she had wanted to wish Lai good luck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all feel frustrated and powerless.

It is happening just as Moscow's own shadow war on Europe is escalating again with a wave of arson and sabotage attacks that officials link to Russian intelligence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emergency response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lithuanian government has declared an emergency situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Balloons have been used by smugglers before, but this October their number suddenly surged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course it started as organised crime activity across the border, but we've seen more than once how Belarus instrumentalises organised crime to have an effect on neighbouring countries,\" Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told the BBC in the capital Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says the balloons are launched from spots that help them best \"target\" Lithuania's main airport, just 30km (19 miles) from the border.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want to make a smuggling operation to take a couple of thousand packs of cigarettes to the other side, you'd do it in the woods or the swamps, not directly at our airport!\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he believes the balloons are a form of political blackmail on Europe's eastern edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Belarus] sees this as leverage: 'You have a border with us, we can cause you huge problems',\" Budrys says. \"What they're doing is really touching the military and security field and we want to prevent a military escalation.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now every night the military police head out on patrol in the border zone. The balloons are most common after dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rattling across fields to reach remote country roads, they then set up mobile checkpoints and step out to stop vehicles at random. They check the drivers' documents and search car boots looking for anyone who may be involved in the smuggling, in the hope of smashing the networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The balloons fly too high to make shooting them down with air defences a safe or economic option, so the government has offered a €1m (£870,000) prize to any firm that can figure out how to intercept them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, teams use military radar to track the balloons in the sky and try to catch smugglers who turn up where the cargo drops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, new criminal charges should also act as a deterrent - with a possible prison sentence for acts of sabotage against civil aviation.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Authorities are patrolling the roads at night, searching for smugglers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the best protection for now is a change in wind direction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was blowing east into Belarus the night we were out with the patrol and the only boxes the soldiers found in a car were full of Christmas shopping not contraband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't seen any balloons, it hasn't affected us personally,\" the woman driver told me after the spot check. \"But we live really close to the border and this whole situation really does worry us.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Belarus up to?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The border itself is now marked by a tall metal fence, with a coil of vicious-looking barbed wire on top and more beyond. Below are giant concrete blocks marking the line before a Belarusian flag and a border post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this extra security is the most obvious sign of how Lithuania now views its neighbour - and its ally Russia - as hostile and dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not far away in Minsk, the man who has ruled Belarus for three decades, Alexander Lukashenko, dismisses all the talk of hybrid warfare as \"nonsense\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recently blamed \"bandit\" smugglers for the balloons, saying they were just seeking a profit and getting creative about overcoming the new security fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lithuania doesn't buy that, partly because Belarus already has form when it comes to \"hybrid\" attacks on the border. In 2021 migrants trying to reach the EU were helped to cross into Lithuania and Poland in big numbers, provoking a deliberate crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are other signs of state involvement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vilnius, Vilmantas Vitkauskas runs the crisis management centre that brings together various branches of government and security services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before, he says, smugglers would send their balloons in clusters to overwhelm security forces on the other side. \"Now they are doing a sequence of one or two balloons every 30 minutes, aimed directly at the airport,\" he explains in front of a giant digital wall map that charts all the balloons spotted so far this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Lukashenko's Belarus... if they were interested in stopping it they can do it tomorrow. But they don't. That means it benefits them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspicion is that Belarus is trying to bully its way into reducing sanctions.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vilmantas Vitkauskas says if Belarus wanted to stop the balloons, it would</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They want to attract political attention and force us to change our policies towards Belarus,\" is how minister Kestutis Budrys sees the sudden influx of balloons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU doesn't recognise Alexander Lukashenko as president because he imprisoned his main opponents ahead of disputed elections in 2020 and oversaw a brutal crackdown afterwards. The sanctions that were imposed then were tightened two years later when he helped Vladimir Putin launch Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First, they want to end the international isolation of the regime and number two, of course, the sanctions,\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has just<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> agreed to lift some sanctions on Belarus,</a> with the country afterwards freeing 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Budrys argues for a harder line with Minsk from Europe. \"We have to expand the sanctions regime against Belarus to include hybrid activities against the EU,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was done with Russia, but not with Belarus.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disruption and delays</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, travellers to and from Lithuania – and the airlines – are having to adapt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is something completely new for the aviation sector, none of the airports in Europe experienced that,\" airport CEO Simonas Bartkus says, inside a shiny new terminal in Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One airline has already relocated its charter flights to Lithuania's second city and another has cut its evening flight service to Vilnius. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bartkus estimates the loss of revenue for all affected businesses will reach €2m by the end of the year. \"One thing is the extra cost for us and the airlines, but the even higher risk is if passengers start to lose trust in air travel,\" he admits.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Martynas (right) says Nato is being tested - \"And we can't even fight simple balloons\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Already, travellers check a new webpage that gives the wind forecast and the likelihood of balloons floating into their flight path before booking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not easy, it makes me a little bit nervous. I'd just like to get home as planned,\" a Polish passenger said, as he waited in the terminal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the last week we were checking every day,\" a local woman, Justina, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We believe this is a hybrid attack on us. I think for them it's really funny to fly those balloons and then laugh at us, not dealing with it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her words hint that another aim of hybrid activity attacks - sowing discontent and political division - is also working, and perhaps harder to defend against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're basically testing the limits of Nato: looking how we protect against these kinds of things,\" says her partner, Martynas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we can't even fight, like, simple balloons.

A synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne last year, a Jewish MP's office was vandalised and a car was torched in Sydney. A childcare centre in Sydney was also set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two Australian nurses were suspended and charged this year after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.

But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images US President Donald Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin \n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with Russia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind?

Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WPA Pool/Getty Images (left to right) British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday.
