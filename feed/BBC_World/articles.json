Without immediate and sustained access, lives will be lost,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency quoted an eight-year-old girl, Sondos, who had fled the city with five family members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In el-Fasher there was a lot of shelling and hunger. Only hunger and bombs,\" the girl said, adding that the family had been surviving on only millet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The WFP said it had trucks loaded with food and nutrition assistance ready to go, and had received clearance from the Sudanese government to proceed to el-Fasher. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is still waiting for word from the RSF on whether it would support a pause in fighting to allow the goods into the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN has been pushing for a week-long humanitarian truce since early June, when a UN convoy on the way to el-Fasher was attacked - with the army and the RSF blaming each other for the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sudan's state news agency reported that head of the armed forces Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan - the country's de facto leader - had agreed to the temporary ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The RSF did not officially respond. However, reports quoting RSF advisers said the group had rejected the initiative as it believed the truce would be used to facilitate the delivery of food and ammunition to \"Burhan's besieged militias\" inside el-Fasher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They also claimed the RSF and its allies were setting up \"safe routes\" for civilians to leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said more than one million people had fled el-Fasher since the conflict began, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg41r3w0e19o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">including those from the nearby Zamzam camp that was seized by the RSF in April</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has heard first-hand accounts of their desperate flight from intensified bombing of el-Fasher, and attacks by RSF-allied gangs on the road.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The WFP said it had made modest progress in delivering food assistance to some other parts of Darfur, but said those fragile gains risked being reversed when roads were closed by the coming rainy season.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Unicef's Sudan representative Sheldon Yett also said some conditions were slowly improving in areas of central Sudan, which had recently become accessible to aid workers after the Sudanese army drove out RSF fighters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he said resources were stretched to the limit because of recent funding cuts, apparently referring to US President Donald Trump administration's drastic decrease in international aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is a looming catastrophe,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are on the verge of irreversible damage to an entire generation of children, not because we lack the knowledge or the tools to save them, but because we are collectively failing to act with the urgency, and at the scale this crisis demands. We need access to these children.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

We're going for the full conquest of the Gaza Strip â€“ and defeating Hamas,\" local journalists quote a senior official as saying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to reports that the army chief and other military leaders oppose the plan, the unnamed official said: \"If that doesn't work for the chief of staff, he should resign.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The families of hostages fear such plans could endanger their loved ones, with 20 out of 50 believed to be alive in Gaza, while polls suggest three in four Israelis instead favour a ceasefire deal to return them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of Israel's close allies would also condemn such a move as they push for an end to the war and action to alleviate a humanitarian crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Within Israel, hundreds of retired Israeli security officials, including former heads of intelligence agencies, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crkznje8nz8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">issued a joint letter to US President Donald Trump on Monday</a>, calling for him to pressure Netanyahu to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of the signatories, ex-domestic intelligence agency chief Ami Ayalon, told the BBC that further military action would be futile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"From the military point of view, [Hamas] is totally destroyed. On the other hand, as an ideology it is getting more and more power among the Palestinian people, within the Arab street around us, and also in the world of Islam.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So the only way to defeat Hamas's ideology is to present a better future.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest developments come after indirect talks with Hamas on a ceasefire and hostage deal broke down and Palestinian armed groups released three videos of two Israeli hostages looking weak and emaciated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The footage of Rom Blaslavski and Evyatar David, both kidnapped from the Nova music festival on 7 October 2023, has shocked and appalled Israelis. David is shown digging what he says is his own grave in an underground tunnel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has been some speculation that the latest media announcements are a pressure tactic to try to force Hamas into a new deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's military says it already has operational control of 75% of Gaza. But under the proposed plan it would occupy the entire territory â€“ moving into areas where more than two million Palestinians are now concentrated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is unclear what that would mean for civilians and for the operations of the UN and other aid groups. About 90% of Gaza's 2.1 million people have been displaced, some repeatedly, and are living in overcrowded and dire conditions. Humanitarian groups and UN officials say many are starving, accusing Israel of impeding the distribution of crucial aid. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel meanwhile says it will allow local businesspeople in Gaza to restart entry of some goods as part of efforts to improve conditions there. Approved items include baby food, fruit and vegetables and hygiene products. Private imports were previously stopped because of claims that Hamas was benefitting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military has previously held back from taking over some areas of Gaza, including central parts, because of an assumption that there are living hostages held there. Last year, six Israeli hostages were executed by their captors after ground forces moved in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There has not been a formal response but officials from the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, denounced the Israeli proposal, calling on the international community to intervene to prevent any new military occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians point out that far-right Israeli ministers have been openly advocating for the full occupation and annexation of Gaza and ultimately want to build new Jewish settlements there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2005, Israel dismantled settlements in the Gaza Strip and withdrew its forces from there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But alongside Egypt, it maintained a tight control of access to the territory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The new occupation idea comes amid growing international moves to revive the two-state solution â€“ the long-time international formula to resolve the decades-old Israel-Palestinian conflict. It envisages an independent Palestinian state being created alongside Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, the UK and Canada joined France in announcing conditional plans for recognising a Palestinian state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli PM is now expected to meet with key ministers and military leaders to decide next steps in Gaza. Israeli army radio says they are due to discuss initial army plans to surround the central refugee camps and carry out air strikes and ground raids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu said he would convene a full security cabinet meeting this week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli media commentators have voiced scepticism and drawn attention to the practical military, political and diplomatic challenges. Writing in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, Nahum Barnea says: \"Netanyahu has never taken a gamble on this scale before.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He notes that the Israeli PM has repeated his vow to achieve all of his war goals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But after 22 months of bloody fighting, it is hard to take those kinds of promises seriously. It seems that Netanyahu has just one objective in the war in Gaza, to prolong the war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken to Gaza as hostages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 61,020 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza since then, the Hamas-run health ministry says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A typical on-shore wind turbine generates 2-3 megawatts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The idea of building a nuclear reactor as a power source on the Moon is not new. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2022 Nasa issued three $5m contracts to companies to design a reactor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And in May this year, China and Russia announced they plan to build an automated nuclear power station on the Moon by 2035.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many scientists agree that it would be the best or perhaps only way to provide continuous power on the lunar surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One lunar day is equivalent to four weeks on Earth, made up of two weeks of continual sunshine and two weeks of darkness.

Solar arrays and batteries alone cannot reliably meet those demands,\" suggests Dr Sungwoo Lim, senior lecturer in space applications, exploration and instrumentation at the university of Surrey</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Nuclear energy is not just desirable, it is inevitable,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lionel Wilson, professor of earth and planetary sciences at Lancaster University, believes it is technically possible to place the reactors on the Moon by 2030 \"given the commitment of enough money\", and he highlights that there are already designs for small reactors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's just a matter of having enough Artemis launches to build the infrastructure on the Moon by then,\" he adds, referring to Nasa's Artemis spaceflight programme that aims to send people and equipment to the Moon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are also some questions around safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Launching radioactive material through the Earth's atmosphere brings safety concerns. You have to have a special license to do that, but it is not insurmountable,\" says Dr Simeon Barber, planetary science specialist at the Open University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Duffy's directive came as a surprise following recent turmoil in Nasa after Mr Trump's administration announced cuts of 24% to Nasa's budgets in 2026.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That includes cuts to a significant number of science programmes such as the Mars Sample Return that aims to return samples from the planet's surface to Earth.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Scientists are also concerned that this announcement is a politically-motivated move in the new international race to the Moon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It seems that we're going back into the old first space race days of competition, which, from a scientific perspective, is a little bit disappointing and concerning,\" says Dr Barber.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Competition can create innovation, but if there's a narrower focus on national interest and on establishing ownership, then you can lose sight of the bigger picture which is exploring the solar system and beyond,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Duffy's comments about the potential for China and Russia to potentially \"declare a keep-out zone\" on the Moon appear to be referring to an agreement called the Artemis accords.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2020 seven nations signed the agreement to establish principles on how countries should co-operate on the Moon's surface. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The accords include so-called safety zones to be established around operations and assets that counties build on the Moon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you build a nuclear reactor or or any kind of base on the moon, you can then start claiming that you have a safety zone around it, because you have equipment there,\" says Dr Barber.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"To some people, this is tantamount to, 'we own this bit of the moon, we're going to operate here and and you can't come in',\" he explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Barber points out that there are hurdles to overcome before placing a nuclear reactor on the Moon for humans to use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nasa's Artemis 3 aims to send humans to the lunar surface in 2027, but it has faced a series of set-backs and uncertainty around funding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If you've got nuclear power for a base, but you've got no way of getting people and equipment there, then it's not much use,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The plans don't appear very joined up at the moment,\" he said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Last year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/russia-and-eurasia/russia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">the US traded goods</a> worth an estimated $3.5bn (Â£2.6bn) with Russia, despite tough sanctions and tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Like any major economy, India will take all necessary measures to safeguard its national interests and economic security,\" the foreign ministry statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, Trump had described India as a \"friend\" but said its tariffs on US products \"are far too high\" and he warned of an unspecified \"penalty\" over its trade with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His latest Truth Social post again struck a critical tone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"India is not only buying massive amounts of Russian Oil, they are then, for much of the Oil purchased, selling it on the Open Market for big profits,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Because of this, I will be substantially raising the Tariff paid by India to the USA,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not ordered India's oil refineries to stop buying Russian oil, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official and head of the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, said Trump's claims about India's oil trade with Russia are misleading for several reasons. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He told the BBC that the trade has been transparent and broadly understood by the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Srivastava said India ramped up purchases of oil to help stabilise global markets after Western sanctions disrupted supplies - helping to stop a global oil price shock. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also said that India's oil refineries - both public and private - decide where to buy crude oil based on factors like price, supply security, and export rules. They operate independently of the government and do not need its approval to buy from Russia or other countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Though relations between the US and Russia warmed after Trump returned to the White house in January, the US president has more recently toughened his rhetoric against the Kremlin and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has questioned whether Putin is truly committed to peace with Ukraine. In Monday's Truth Social post he used stern language, describing the Russian military as the \"Russian War Machine\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's leader has repeatedly said he is ready for peace but only if Kyiv meets certain conditions, such as recognising Ukrainian territories that Russia has occupied. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has threatened Moscow with severe tariffs targeting its oil and other exports if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by 8 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US envoy Steve Witkoff is due to visit Russia later this week, where he is expected to meet Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-soutik-biswas\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Additional reporting by Soutik Biswas</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

However, amid a cost-of-living crisis, the state's new leader Steven Miles opted instead to upgrade existing venues to host the games events, a decision some criticised as an embarrassment for Australia on the world stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Months later, he lost an election to the Liberal National Party which campaigned on a promise of no new stadiums.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But after the new government's own review, new premier David Crisafulli adopted the plan to build a venue in Victoria Park, and has since introduced laws exempting new Olympic venues from planning rules in a bid to fast-track the development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However the plans have been met with protests in Queensland, with some locals concerned about losing a large inner-city green space, and other worried about potential damage to cultural heritage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The state and federal governments have signaled they will engage with Indigenous groups on the development plans at Victoria Park. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Brisbane's Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner told the Brisbane Times that there was strong support for the stadium.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Ultimately, this is going to happen,\" he said. \"No doubt there will be attempts to thwart the project and slow it down.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

An estimated 140,000 Koreans were living in Hiroshima at the time - many having moved there due to forced labour mobilisation, or to survive under colonial exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those who survived the atom bomb, along with their descendants, continue to live in the long shadow of that day â€“ wrestling with disfigurement, pain, and a decades-long fight for justice that remains unresolved.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8a14/live/e31ea160-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A person walks up a street towards a pair of blocky white buildings in front of a brown hillside, with trees growing on the side of the road\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Hapcheon has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\" due to the number of nuclear bomb survivors who lived there after the war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"No-one takes responsibility,\" says Shim Jin-tae, an 83-year-old survivor. \"Not the country that dropped the bomb. Not the country that failed to protect us. America never apologised. Japan pretends not to know. Korea is no better. They just pass the blame - and we're left alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Shim now lives in Hapcheon, South Korea: a small county which, having become the home of dozens of survivors like he and Ms Lee, has been dubbed \"Korea's Hiroshima\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ms Lee, the shock of that day has not faded  - it etched itself into her body as illness. She now lives with skin cancer, Parkinson's disease, and angina, a condition stemming from poor blood flow to the heart, which typically manifests as chest pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But what weighs more heavily is that the pain didn't stop with her. Her son Ho-chang, who supports her, was diagnosed with kidney failure and is undergoing dialysis while awaiting a transplant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I believe it's due to radiation exposure, but who can prove it?\" Ho-chang Lee says. \"It's hard to verify scientifically - you'd need genetic testing, which is exhausting and expensive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) told the BBC that it had gathered genetic data between 2020 and 2024 and would continue further studies until 2029. It would \"consider expanding the definition of victims\" to second- and- third-generation survivors only \"if the results are statistically significant\", it said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The Korean toll</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Of the 140,000 Koreans in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing, many were from Hapcheon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Surrounded by mountains with little farmland, it was a difficult place to live. Crops were seized by the Japanese occupiers, droughts ravaged the land, and thousands of people left the rural country for Japan during the war. Some were forcibly conscripted; others were lured by the promise that \"you could eat three meals a day and send your kids to school.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in Japan, Koreans were second-class citizens â€“ often given the hardest, dirtiest and most dangerous jobs. Mr Shim says his father worked in a munitions factory as a forced labourer, while his mother hammered nails into wooden ammunition crates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the aftermath of the bomb, this distribution of labour translated into dangerous and often fatal work for Koreans in Hiroshima.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ad/live/4a13b4b0-7116-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Hyojung Kim An old man in a chequered blazer sits in front of a black-and-white photograph showing destroyed streets and debris \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/Hyojung Kim</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">For Shim Jin-tae, it's not just about being compensated â€“ it's about being acknowledged</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Korean workers had to clean up the dead,\" Mr Shim, who is the director of the Hapcheon branch of the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, tells BBC Korean. \"At first they used stretchers, but there were too many bodies. Eventually, they used dustpans to gather corpses and burned them in schoolyards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was mostly Koreans who did this. Most of the post-war clean-up and munitions work was done by us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to a study by the Gyeonggi Welfare Foundation, some survivors were forced to clear rubble and recover bodies. While Japanese evacuees fled to relatives, Koreans without local ties remained in the city, exposed to the radioactive fallout â€“ and with  limited access to medical care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A combination of these conditions - poor treatment, hazardous work and structural discrimination - all contributed to a disproportionately high death toll among Koreans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Korean Atomic Bomb Victims Association, the Korean fatality rate was  57.1%, compared to the overall rate of about 33.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About 70,000 Koreans were exposed to the bomb. By year's end, some 40,000 had died.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Outcasts at home</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the bombings, which led to Japan's surrender and Korea's subsequent liberation, about 23,000 Korean survivors returned home. But they were not welcomed. Branded as disfigured or cursed, they faced prejudice even in their homeland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hapcheon already had a leper colony,\" Mr Shim explains. \"And because of that image, people thought the bomb survivors had skin diseases too.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Such stigma made survivors stay silent about their plight, he adds, suggesting that \"survival came before pride\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Lee says she saw this \"with her own eyes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People who were badly burned or extremely poor were treated terribly,\" she recalls. \"In our village, some people had their backs and faces so badly scarred that only their eyes were visible. They were rejected from marriage and shunned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With stigma came poverty, and hardship. Then came illnesses with no clear cause: skin diseases, heart conditions, kidney failure, cancer. The symptoms were everywhere - but no-one could explain them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over time, the focus shifted to the second and third generations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/acfa/live/2718b2a0-7114-11f0-a0b6-378ae6c474ca.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Hyojung Kim A middle-aged woman with short black hair and glasses looks into the camera\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">BBC/Hyojung Kim</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Second-generation survivor Han Jeong-sun can't walk without dragging herself, and has faced stigma from her own family</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Han Jeong-sun, a second-generation survivor, suffers from avascular necrosis in her hips, and can't walk without dragging herself. Her first son was born with cerebral palsy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My son has never walked a single step in his life,\" she says. \"And my in-laws treated me horribly.

That survey was mostly based on questionnaires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to BBC inquiries, the ministry explained that prior to 2019, \"There was no legal basis for funding or official investigations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But two separate studies had found that second-generation victims were more vulnerable to illness. One, from 2005, showed that second-generation victims were far more likely than the general population to suffer depression, heart disease and anaemia, while another from 2013 found their disability registration rate was nearly double the national average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Against this backdrop, Ms Han is incredulous that authorities keep asking for proof to recognise her and her son as victims of Hiroshima.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My illness is the proof.

The BBC believes the madams have moved location since then. The police said the women and young girls we filmed could not be traced. To date there have been no arrests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Convictions are rare in Kenya. For successful prosecutions, police need testimonies from children. Often vulnerable minors are too afraid to testify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC's grainy footage filmed on the street in the dark showed one woman, who calls herself Nyambura, laughing as she says: \"They're still children, so it's easy to manipulate them by just handing them sweets.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Undercover filming in Maai Mahiu with the madams and some of their young victims</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Prostitution is a cash crop in Maai Mahiu; the truckers basically fuel it. And that's how we benefit. It's been normalised in Maai Mahiu,\" she explained, adding that she had one girl as young as 13, who had already been \"working\" for six months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It becomes very risky when you're dealing with minors. You can't just bring them outâ€¯openly in town. I only sneak them out at night in great secrecy,\" Nyambura said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The act of prostitution by a consenting adult is not explicitly criminalised under Kenyan national law but it is banned by many municipal by-laws. It is not banned in Maai Mahiu, which is part of Nakuru county.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the penal code it is illegal to live from the earnings of prostitution, either as a sex worker or third party facilitating or profiting from prostitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trafficking or sale of minors under the age of 18 carries a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked whether the clients wear condoms, Nyambura said she usually made sure they had  protection but the odd one did not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Some children want to earn more [so don't use them]. Some are forced [not to use them],\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In another meeting, she led the undercover investigator to a house where three young girls sat huddled on a sofa, another on a hard-backed chair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nyambura then left the room, giving the investigator an opportunity to speak to the girls alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They described being repeatedly abused for sex, on a daily basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sometimes you have sex with multiple people.

We also have our regulars who always come back for them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cheptoo took the undercover investigator to a club to meet four of her girls. The youngest said she was 13 years old. The others said they were 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She opened up about the profit she makes from them, saying for every 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($23; Â£17) the girls deliver, her share was 2,500 shillings ($19; Â£14).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another meeting, in a house in Maai Mahiu, Cheptoo left the undercover investigator alone with two underage girls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of them told her she had, on average, sex with five men a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked what happened if she refused to have sex without a condom, she said she had no choice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I have to [have sex without a condom]. I will be chased away, and I have nowhere to run to. I am an orphan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kenya's sex industry is a complex, murky world where both men and women are involved in facilitating child prostitution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not known how many children are forced into sex work in Maai Mahiu, but in this small town of around 50,000 people it is easy to find them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"people-outside-the-uk-can-watch\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">People outside the UK can watch </b><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHINoFq8GvE\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><b id=\"here\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">here</b></a></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A former sex worker, known as \"Baby Girl\", now provides refuge in Maai Mahiu for girls who have escaped sexual abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 61-year-old worked in the sex industry for 40 years - first finding herself on the streets in her early twenties. She was pregnant and had her three young children with her after fleeing her husband because of domestic violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At her wooden kitchen table in a bright parlour at the front of her house, she introduced the BBC to four young women who were all forced into sex work by madams in Maai Mahiu when they were children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each girl shared similar stories of broken families or abuse at home - they came to Maai Mahiu to escape, only to be violently abused again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Michelle described how, at 12 years old, she lost her parents to HIV and was evicted on to the streets where she met a man who gave her somewhere to live and began sexually abusing her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I literally had to pay him in kind for educating me. I reached my limit, but I had no-one,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two years later, she was approached by a woman who turned out to be a madam in Maai Mahiu and forced her into sex work.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lilian, who is now 19, also lost her parents at a very young age. She was left with an uncle who filmed her in the shower and sold the images to his friends. The voyeurism soon turned into rape.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That was my worst day. I was 12 then.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When she escaped, she was raped again by a truck driver who took her to Maai Mahiu. It was here, like Michelle, where she was approached by a woman who forced her into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These young women's short lives have been fuelled by violence, neglect and abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, housed by Baby Girl, they are learning new skills - two in a photography studio and two in a beauty salon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They also assist Baby Girl with her outreach work in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nakuru county has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya, and Baby Girl, supported by US aid agency USAID, is on a mission to educate people about the risks of unprotected sex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She has an office at Karagita Community Health Centre, near Lake Naivasha, where she works providing condoms and advice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, with US President Donald Trump's decision to pull USAID funding, her outreach programmes are about to stop.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">As part of her outreach work, Baby Girl hands out condoms on the streets near Lake Naivasha in Nakuru county</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"From September we will be unemployed,\" she told the BBC World Service, adding how worried she was about the young women and girls who depend on her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You see how vulnerable these children are.

Everything feels extravagant, emotional and larger than life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now imagine all of that without the bride and groom. No pheras (a Hindu marriage ritual where the couple takes seven rounds around a sacred fire), no relatives, no tearful farewells. Just the party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Welcome to the world of fake weddings - a rising trend in Indian cities where people gather to enjoy the wedding party, minus the actual marriage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These ticketed events, organised by hotels, clubs and companies, are designed purely for fun and promise to offer the full experience of a wedding party without any stress, rituals or responsibilities. Simply put, it's a wedding-themed party night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the past few weeks, fake weddings have been making a splash in big cities such as Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. The attendees are usually young people looking to enjoy a night out with friends, indulging in the drama and fun of a traditional Indian wedding without the attendant pressures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, we attended one such curated event in Delhi - a fake sangeet<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i>(a sangeet is a night of music and dance usually held a few days before the wedding).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the event, held at a plush club, the vibe was electric: women twirled in sequinned saris and lehengas (long skirts and blouses), men showed up in tailored kurtas and ethnic jackets. A traditional dhol drummer led the crowd to the dance floor and tequila-filled gol gappas (a popular Indian street snack) made the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shivangi Sareen, who attended an event like this for the first time, found it \"amazing\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Shivangi Sareen, right, said the fake sangeet was a memorable experience</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At family weddings, there's so much pressure - the rules around dressing up, the judgement [from relatives]. But here, it's just fun,\" she said. \"Especially because we got to do it all with our friends. We decided our outfits the day before and got ready together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ticket prices typically start at around 1,500 rupees ($17; Â£13) and can go up to 15,000 rupees or more, depending on the venue and facilities. Shivangi and her friends paid 10,000 rupees per couple to attend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I wouldn't mind spending this once a month. The whole experience was totally worth it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sharad Madan, owner of a restaurant which hosted the event, says the trend underscores that novelty is key in the hospitality sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We have to keep doing something new for our patrons,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It cost them around a million rupees to plan and organise the event, Mr Madan says, and the team expected to make double that through ticket sales. But it's not just about profits, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's about engagement. Even if it doesn't give me the same kind of returns, I would still do it because our patrons want something different.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Kaushal Chanani, co-founder of 8Club events which hosted a fake wedding party attended by 2,000 people in Bengaluru last month, says that the inspiration for fake weddings came from young Indians living abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People from the diaspora would gather and dance to Bollywood music, dress in ethnic [traditional] clothes and enjoy the evening,\" he said. \"This is the idea we followed as well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The response to the Bengaluru event, held at a five-star hotel, was \"overwhelming\", he says. It encouraged them to plan a similar event in Delhi - which was sold out - and they started getting queries from event organisers in other cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata and Lucknow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We now give out our standard operating procedure (SOP) to people who are interested,\" he says. \"It is a guide on how to create the experience, market it and make it profitable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, not all fake weddings follow the same script.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a18b/live/00c991c0-6d1b-11f0-a833-a93f3b53dff8.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Trippy Tequila A woman dancing while showing her back.

Alcohol was deliberately left out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sometimes booze takes away from the experience,\" Mr Pandey said. \"We wanted to do more than just a pub night or a regular takeover. We wanted to showcase the spirit of Indian weddings.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Commentators say the popularity of these events reflects young people's growing desire to find reasons to celebrate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"People need a hook of some kindâ€¦ an occasion to celebrate. And there's no better setting than a wedding, which brings together all the elements of fun,\" says writer and social commentator Santosh Desai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's the pinnacle of enjoyment - especially when it's free from the stress that accompanies real weddings.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also points out that these events give people a reason to re-wear expensive wedding outfits bought in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So, are such events here to stay?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Event planner Vijay Arora, founder of Delhi-based Touchwood Events, believes fake weddings are currently a fad - but one with potential.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Gen Z definitely wants to be part of such celebrations,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If it emerges as a new market category then it can be a major game changer since the scale will increase - which eventually amps up business opportunities for the entire industry.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's wedding industry <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wrightresearch.in/blog/analyzing-indias-booming-dollar130-billion-wedding-industry-wright-videos/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">is estimated to be worth around $130bn</a>, according to investment advisory firm Wright Research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While the sector is booming, there are constraints. Most weddings take place during the cooler months - typically between November and March - and often at auspicious times, while the monsoon season (June to August) is considered off-season.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With venues free, vendors available and people constantly chasing experiences, fake weddings could step in to fill the gap if the trend holds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Arora says he was surprised by the rise of fake weddings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But it also helps in understanding that such events are something that we want to celebrate or be a part of. Even if we can't attend the real events our friends or family host, we still want to experience them by joining these fake ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, not every guest walks away thrilled.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cb5/live/87460a60-6cff-11f0-af60-2b05e9c584bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Third Place People wearing traditional Indian clothes participate in games at a fake wedding party \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Third Place</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Some fake wedding events include tarot readings or astrology-themed games</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Srishti Sharma, a 23-year-old Bengaluru-based marketing professional, said she was underwhelmed by the only fake wedding she attended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I've lived away from home for a few years now and I really missed attending a wedding,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The biggest plus was not having nagging relatives telling you 'you're next in line to get married'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Sharma and her friends spent hours picking outfits, but the event fell short.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They began with EDM and switched to Bollywood only after two hours,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expected wedding food but got pizza and fries - no dessert, just alcohol.

The building is ringed with CCTV cameras too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I've never been this close,\" admits Carmen Lau.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Carmen, who is 30, fled Hong Kong in 2021 as pro-democracy activists in the territory were being arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She argues that the UK should not allow China's \"authoritarian regime\" to have its new embassy in such a symbolic location. One of her fears is that China, with such a huge embassy, could harass political opponents and could even hold them in the building.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are also worries, among some dissidents, that its location - very near London's financial district - could be an espionage risk. Then there is the opposition from residents who say it would pose a security risk to them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plans had previously been rejected by the local council, but the decision now lies with the government - and senior ministers have signalled they are in favour if minor adjustments are made to the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The site is sprawling, at 20,000 square metres, and if it goes ahead it would mark the biggest embassy in Europe. But would it also really bring the dangers that its opponents fear?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">The biggest embassy in Europe</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China bought the old Royal Mint Court for Â£255m in 2018. The area has layer upon layer of history: across the road is the Tower, parts of it were built by William the Conqueror. For centuries kings and queens lived there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plan itself involves a cultural centre and housing for 200 staff, but in the basement, behind security doors, there are also rooms with no identified use on the plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's easy for me to imagine what would happen if I was taken to the Chinese embassy,\" says Carmen.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Carmen fled to London but believes she has continued to be targeted</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2022, a Hong Kong pro-democracy protester was dragged into the grounds of the Chinese consulate in Manchester and beaten. British police nearby stepped over the boundary to rescue him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in 2019, mass protests had erupted in Hong Kong, triggered by the government's attempt to bring in a new law allowing for Hong Kong citizens to be extradited to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's response included a law that forced all elected officials in Hong Kong, including Carmen who was then a district councillor, to take an oath of loyalty to China. Carmen resigned instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She claims that journalists for Chinese state-run media started following her. The Ta Kung Pao newspaper, which is controlled by China's central government in Beijing, ran a front page story alleging she and her colleagues had held parties in their council offices.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You know the tactics of the regime,\" she says. \"They were following you, trying to harass you.

More than 300 women turned up to share their experiences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UK study is not an outlier.

Switzerland may be a wealthy, highly developed, high-tech country now, but its history is rural, marked by poverty and harsh living conditions. Famine in the 19th century caused waves of emigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Kalbermatten explains that the word \"heimat\" is hugely important in Switzerland. \"Heimat is when you close your eyes and you think about what you did as a child, the place you lived as a child.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's a much bigger word than home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ask a Swiss person living for decades in Zurich or Geneva, or even New York, where their heimat is, and for many, the answer will be the village they were born in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Mr Kalbermatten and his sister and brothers, who live in cities, heimat is the valley where people speak LeetschÃ¤r, the dialect they all still dream in.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d109/live/d1c322b0-6ec3-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Imogen Foulkes Traditional wooden masks called Tschaeggaetta, which are unique to the valley.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Imogen Foulkes</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Traditional wooden masks called TschÃ¤ggÃ¤ttÃ¤ are unique to that valley</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fear is that if these valleys become depopulated, other aspects of unique mountain culture could be lost too - like the TschÃ¤ggÃ¤ttÃ¤, traditional wooden masks, unique to the Loetschental valley. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their origins are mysterious, possibly pagan.
