Venezuela and has been in power since 2013, has frequently been accused of repressing opposition groups and silencing dissent in Venezuela, at times with the use of violence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is widely seen by opponents within his country as well as by foreign governments as having illegitimately won Venezuela's 2024 election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's left-wing leader and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at their compound and flown to the US, as part of a dramatic special forces operation in the early hours of Saturday that also saw strikes on military bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple have since been charged with weapon and drug offences and are set to appear at a court in New York on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While US officials have said that no American troops were harmed in the attacks, Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino said a \"large part\" of Maduro's security team and \"soldiers and innocent civilians\" were killed in the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked why congressional authorisation wasn't sought before the US operation in Venezuela, Rubio told ABC it \"wasn't necessary because this wasn't an invasion\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He described it as a \"law enforcement operation\", and said Maduro was arrested on the ground by FBI agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You can't notify Congress of an operation like this because \"it will leak\", he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to US media outlets, Rubio was asked if the US recognises Rodríguez as the legitimate president of Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He answered that \"this is not about the legitimate president\" as the US does not recognise the regime as legitimate.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

Hakeem Jeffries said the secretive military operation, which was conducted without approval from Congress, \"was not simply a narcotics operation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an act of war,\" Jeffries told NBC's Meet the Press. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was a military action involving Delta Force, involving the army, apparently involving thousands of

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with ABC This Week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned the legality of the US operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schumer said that while he believes Maduro is a horrible person, \"You don't treat lawlessness with other lawlessness\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have learned through the years when America tries

Some had their social media accounts suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The judge said the eight men and two women had acted with a clear desire to do harm to Brigitte Macron, making remarks online that were degrading and insulting.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two of the defendants - self-styled independent journalist Natacha Rey and internet fortune-teller Amandine Roy – were found guilty of slander in 2024 for claiming that France's first lady had never existed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said her brother Jean-Michel Trogneux had changed gender and started using her name. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were later cleared on appeal. The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But last year there was a radical change of course. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.</p></div></div></body></html>"

eZyhnA\">Beijing ramped up the rhetoric against Japan after its prime minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in parliament that Tokyo could respond with its own self defence force in case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So visiting Beijing at this time is a significant move for Lee. Like Japan, South Korea too is an ally of the US, which supports Taiwan and supplies arms for its defence.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi is expected to hold a welcoming ceremony for Lee in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, state-run CCTV reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee, who arrived in Beijing on Sunday, will then meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji, before flying to Shanghai.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. The relationship soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.    </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other side, Xi's eagerness to meet Lee signals the pressure he faces in finding a regional ally, Park Seung-chan, professor of China studies at Yongin University told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China may beat around the bush but its demand is clear: side with China and denounce Japan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing has been leveraging the two countries' shared history of fighting against Japan during the 20th Century, Mr Park said. Lee is expected to hold a memorial service in Shanghai for activists who fought for Korea's independence from Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Korea is \"still showing all its deference towards China\", it wants to \"strengthen its relationships with both Japan and China\", Mr Park added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seoul has long walked a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee is reportedly planning to visit Japan later this month to meet Takaichi. And on Friday, South Korea's national security director Wi Sung-lac told reporters the country \"respects the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-38285354\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">One China policy</a>\" - the diplomatic acknowledgment that Beijing is the only Chinese government. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security on the Korean Peninsula will also be part of the discussions with China, Wi told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has sought to engage North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far. He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is the dictator's biggest supporter, economically and diplomatically, Russia aside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"China is a very important cooperative partner in moving toward peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula,\" Lee said on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, a reference to  the US's capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are other sore spots, such as China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Persuading Beijing to lift these restrictions is said to be high on Lee's agenda. China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee will also be seeking to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA/Shutterstock Venezuelans in Miami, Florida, hold a picture of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a rally in support of the US operation in Venezuela.

Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more-compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for \"taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Cuba is ready to fall,\" retorted Trump on Air Force One.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The deputy ambassador, Jay Dharmadhikari, said Maduro's taking by the US runs \"counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution and runs counter to the principle of the non-use of force\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the Council: \"The proliferation of violations of the Charter of the UN and the violations of international law by states vested with responsibility as permanent members of Security Council chips away at the very foundation of the international order, contravening the principles of the charter, including the principle of respect for independence and territorial integrity of states, undermines the foundation of the UN and weakens international peace and security.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deputy UN ambassador for Denmark, Sandra Jensen Landi, voiced her country's \"deep concern\" at the evolving situation and said: \"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent. International law and the UN Charter… must be respected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both these statements – by France and Denmark - represent a significant stiffening of European criticism of the seizing of Maduro after some initial equivocation by many EU members. In contrast, both UK and Greek diplomats at the UN did not condemn the US military operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ambassador for Panama, Eloy Alfaro de Alba, expressed concern about US plans to work with the existing regime, without involving the opposition or holding fresh elections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the Council: \"Any attempt to establish a permanent government headed by a figure from the repressive apparatus such as Delcy Rodriguez would constitute continuity of the system and not a genuine transition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colombia's ambassador Leonor Zalabata Torres said there is no justification for the unilateral use of force to commit an act of aggression: \"Such actions constitute a serious violation of international law and the UN Charter.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's ambassador, Vassili Nebenzia, accused the US of \"international banditry\" and \"neo-colonialism and imperialism\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said there was no justification for \"US domination by force\" and accused US allies of hypocrisy and double standards for failing to criticise Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's Chargé d'Affaires, Sun Lei, said Beijing was \"deeply shocked and strongly condemned\" what he called the \"unilateral, illegal and bullying acts of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement read out on his behalf, Antonio Guterres, the UN Secretary General, said he remained \"deeply concerned that rules of international law have not been respected\" during the US action: \"The power of the law must prevail.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By contrast, the acting UK ambassador, James Kariuki, gave a very brief statement, saying merely the UK wanted to see a \"safe and peaceful transition to a legitimate government that reflects the will of the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added, without being specific, that the UK \"reaffirms its commitment to international law and the principles enshrined in the charter of the UN\". Greece's deputy ambassador, Ioannis Stamatekos, also failed to condemn Trump's seizure of Maduro, calling instead for \"dialogue and diplomacy\" to resolve the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the US, UN ambassador Mike Waltz said the capture of Maduro was a law-enforcement operation against an illegitimate leader responsible for both drug trafficking and terrorism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can't turn Venezuela into the operating hub for Iran, for Hezbollah, for gangs, for the Cuban intelligence agents and other malign actors that control that country,\" Waltz told the Council. \"You cannot continue to have the largest energy reserves in the world under the control of adversaries of the US.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many European countries, the seizing of Maduro has posed a difficult diplomatic dilemma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have been torn between defending fundamental principles of the UN charter that countries should not breach each other's sovereignty, or making a pragmatic, real politik decision not to anger the US on whose support and security they rely, especially for Ukraine</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hence UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's refusal to say if the US attack on Venezuela was a breach of international law. He said merely that \"international law is the framework, is the anchor or the benchmark against which we judge the actions of all other governments. And it is, of course, for the US to justify the action that it has taken\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Likewise, the EU issued its own statement, saying that \"under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be upheld\" without saying whether that applied in this case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU considered Maduro illegitimate and his drug trafficking a \"significant security threat worldwide\" but the bloc said nothing about Trump's declaration that the US will now \"run\" the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French and Danish criticism now places them alongside Spain, which had been the only European country to voice concerns, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez saying his government would \"not recognise an intervention that violates international law and pushes the region toward a horizon of uncertainty and belligerence\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c68/live/2f0f8220-e9c5-11f0-aacf-813a04f5c647.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Donald Trump wearing a light blue tie and blue suit. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The EU said nothing about Mr Trump's declaration that the US will now \"run\" the country</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The difficulty for other European leaders, fearful of upsetting Trump, is that they risk accusations of hypocrisy from other countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, European powers have argued Russia's invasion of Ukraine should be opposed in part because it broke international rules about territorial integrity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many developing countries rejected that argument, citing western military adventurism from Vietnam to Iraq. They will now add Venezuela to that list.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The question is how Europe may respond in the longer term to America's military operation in Venezuela. Will it provide a catalyst for the continent to take greater responsibility for its own security in the face of so much instability from what many see as an unreliable ally? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Tusk, the prime minister of Poland, certainly hopes so, saying on social media: \"No-one will take seriously a weak and divided Europe: neither enemy nor ally.

Domestically, however, the US's actions fall into a legal grey area that may still result in Maduro standing trial, regardless of the circumstances that brought him there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US maintains its actions were legally justified. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of \"narco-terrorism\" and enabling the transport of \"thousands of tonnes\" of cocaine to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All personnel involved acted professionally, decisively, and in strict accordance with US law and established protocols,\" Bondi said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has long denied US allegations that he oversees an illegal drug operation, and in court in New York on Monday he entered a plea of not guilty.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Nicolás Maduro and wife en route to New York court</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the charges are focused on drugs, the US prosecution of Maduro comes after years of criticism of his leadership of Venezuela from the wider international community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, UN investigators said Maduro's government had committed \"egregious violations\" amounting to crimes against humanity - and that the president and other top officials were implicated. The US and some of its allies have also accused Maduro of rigging elections, and did not recognise him as the legitimate president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's alleged links to drugs cartels are the focus of this legal case, yet the US methods in putting him before a US judge to answer these charges are also under scrutiny.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conducting a military operation in Venezuela and whisking Maduro out of the country under the cover of darkness was \"completely illegal under international law,\" said Luke Moffett, a professor at the Queen's University Belfast School of Law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Moffett and other experts pointed to a host of issues raised by the US operation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The United Nations Charter prohibits members from threatening or using force against other states. It allows for \"self-defence if an armed attack occurs\" but that threat must be imminent, Prof Moffett said. The other exception occurs when the UN Security Council approves such an action, which the US did not obtain before it took action in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">International law would consider the drug-trafficking offences the US alleges against Maduro to be a law enforcement matter, experts say, not a violent attack that might justify one country to take military action against another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In public statements, the Trump administration has characterised the operation as, in the words of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, \"basically a law enforcement function\", rather than an act of war or a military campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has been under indictment on drug trafficking charges in the US since 2020; the justice department has now issued a superseding - or revised - indictment against the Venezuelan leader. The Trump administration essentially says it is now enforcing it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The mission was conducted to support an ongoing criminal prosecution tied to large-scale narcotics trafficking and related offenses that have fuelled violence, destabilised the region, and contributed directly to the drug crisis claiming American lives,\" Bondi said in her statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But since the operation, several legal experts have said the US broke international law by taking Maduro out of Venezuela on its own.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A country cannot go into another foreign country and arrest people,\" said Milena Sterio, an expert on international criminal law at Cleveland State University College of Law. \"If the US wants to arrest someone in another country, the proper way to do that is extradition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if an individual faces indictment in America, \"The US has no right to go around the wold enforcing the arrest warrant in the territory of other sovereign states,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's lawyers in court in Manhattan on Monday said they would challenge the legality of the US operation which took him from Caracas to New York.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's also a long-running legal debate about whether presidents must follow the UN Charter. The US Constitution considers treaties the country enters to be the \"supreme law of the land\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there's a clear historic example of a presidential administration arguing it did not have to comply with the charter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 1989, the George HW Bush administration removed Panama's military leader Manuel Noriega and brought him to the US to face drug trafficking charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An internal Justice Department memo from the time argued that the president had the legal authority to order the FBI to arrest individuals who violated US law, \"even if those actions contravene customary international law\" - including the UN Charter.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/776c/live/2a909830-ea5e-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images General Manuel Antonio Noriega speaks in May 1988 in Panama City\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">General Manuel Antonio Noriega speaks in May 1988 in Panama City</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The author of that memo, William Barr, became the US attorney general during Trump's first term, and brought the initial 2020 indictment against Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the memo's reasoning later came under criticism from legal scholars. US courts have not explicitly weighed in on the matter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US, the question of whether this operation broke any domestic laws is complicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, but puts the president in charge of the armed forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Nixon-era law called the War Powers Resolution places restrictions on the president's ability to use military force. It requires the president to consult Congress before committing US troops abroad \"in every possible instance,\" and notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration did not give Congress a heads up before the action in Venezuela \"because it endangers the mission,\" Rubio said on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, several presidents have tested the limits of their powers to order military actions without congressional approval, and Trump has been carrying out military strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean for months despite bipartisan criticism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US federals courts now have jurisdiction over Maduro, regardless of how he arrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro could argue that the US violated international laws when it forcibly brought him to New York. But extensive legal precedent suggests a trial against Maduro would go forward, Prof Sterio said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our courts have long recognised that for a defendant, even if they are kidnapped or abducted or forcibly brought to the US, that is not grounds for tossing out the case,\" she said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago.  Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance?  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sounded as if he believes something like that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military operation is only the first stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neither country was in America's backyard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China condemned the US action. It said \"hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US should \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even so, China might see a precedent set by the US action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is not how the world of power works. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Large French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prof Xavier Crettiez says that fighting financial crime is a now key job for spies</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organized crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specializes in money laundering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cybersecurity and spying threats as well as sabotage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the younger students, Alexandre Hubert, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another class member, Valentine Guillot, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Students Alexandre Hubert and Valentine Guillot were happy to be photographed</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested  because they think it will provide for a better world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8330/live/233a1870-da89-11f0-ad83-3fe81c076d4b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Sciences Po Saint-Germain Students on the diploma course, with some standing with their backs to the camera\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Sciences Po Saint-Germain</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In a recent class photo some students chose to stand with their backs to the camera</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs.
