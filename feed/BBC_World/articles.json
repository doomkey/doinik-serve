Forces would also take control of refugee camps in central Gaza and areas where hostages are thought to be held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A second offensive would follow weeks later in parallel with a boost in humanitarian aid, media say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The move to escalate the conflict has drawn fierce opposition from some within Israel, including from military officials and the families of hostages being held in Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas has said the plan to occupy Gaza City \"constitutes a new war crime\" and would \"cost [Israel] dearly\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reacting to Israel's decision, UN human rights chief Volker Turk warned that further escalation \"will result in more massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cm2kyg0g8kxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move \"wrong\",</a> saying it \"will only bring more bloodshed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged Israel \"not to go down this path\", stressing that it would \"only worsen the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Turkey's foreign ministry urged the world community to prevent Israel's plan, which it said aimed to \"forcibly displace Palestinians from their own land\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In China, a foreign ministry spokesperson told the AFP news agency that \"Gaza belongs to the Palestinian people and is an inseparable part of Palestinian territory\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Netanyahu told German Chancellor Friedrich Merz he was disappointed with Berlin's decision to suspend arms exports to Israel, saying it was \"rewarding Hamas terrorism\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Israel itself, families of the remaining hostages in Gaza have warned that the lives of the 20 believed to have survived will be put in peril.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters said the decision \"is leading us toward a colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the US has been less critical.

Polls suggest most of the Israeli public favour a deal with Hamas for the release of the 50 hostages, 20 of whom are thought to be alive, and the end of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The threat of a full occupation could be part of a strategy to try to force the group into making concessions in stalled ceasefire talks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli leaders say Hamas, for now, is not interested in negotiating as, in their view, the group is feeling emboldened, a view that seems to be shared by the Trump administration which has not expressed opposition to Israel's plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many here believe that Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee the survival of his coalition, which relies on the support of ultranationalist ministers who have threatened to quit the government if the war ends.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have also publicly defended what they describe as the voluntary migration of Palestinians from Gaza - which could amount to the forced displacement of civilians, a war crime - and resettling it with Jews.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu's ideas have faced strong opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to reports in the Israeli media, had warned the prime minister that a full occupation Gaza was \"tantamount to walking into a trap\" and would endanger the living hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the hostages' families share those concerns, and say the only way to guarantee the release of the hostages is through a negotiated deal with Hamas and ending the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Maariv newspaper, the \"prevailing assessment is that most and possibly all of the living hostages [will] die\" during an expanded offensive, either killed by their captors or accidentally by Israeli soldiers.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: MSF doctor Caroline Willeman speaks about worsening situation in Gaza</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of the security cabinet meeting, Netanyahu gave an interview to Fox News in which he said Israel intended to take full control of Gaza. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The decision of the cabinet appeared to stop short of officially endorsing that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the Fox interview, Netanyahu suggested that Israel did not want to keep the territory. \"We don't want to govern it,\" he said. \"We don't want to be there as a governing body. We want to hand it over to Arab forces.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He did not give details about possible arrangements or which countries could be involved. Still, this was a rare indication of what he might be envisioning for a post-war Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has, so far, failed to offer a vision for Gaza after the war apart from refusing to accept a governing role for the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied West Bank and recognises Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas. The Hamas 7 October attacks on Israel killed about 1,200 people, while 251 were taken to Gaza as hostages.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Deadly aerial strikes are a nightly occurrence across the country, while Russia's refineries and energy facilities come under regular attack from Kyiv's drones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is against this backdrop that the Kremlin confirmed a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin was being planned and due to take place soon. \"I'm here to get [the war] over with,\" the US leader said on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine held at his behest between May and July have failed to bring the two sides any closer to peace, and Trump may hope that taking the situation into his own hands could finally result in a ceasefire.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the gulf between Kyiv and Moscow is so large that even Trump-mediated talks could make it difficult to bridge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a memorandum presented to the Ukrainians by Russia in June, Moscow outlined its maximalist demands for a \"final settlement\" of the conflict.

It wasn't building rockets but at least it involved flying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lovell signed up to a programme that sent him to college at the military's expense while training as a fighter pilot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two years in, he gambled and switched to the Navy Academy at Annapolis, on Chesapeake Bay, in the hope of working with his beloved rockets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was a lucky decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A few months later, the Korean War broke out and his former fellow apprentice pilots were sent to South East Asia.

The navy did not want its midshipmen wasting their time on such frivolities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Lovell had a sweetheart. Marilyn Gerlach was the high school girl he'd shyly asked to the prom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Women were not allowed on campus and trips outside were limited to 45 minutes.

Over 24 weeks, abortions can only be carried out if the mother's life is in danger. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">People found guilty of supplying or using drugs for abortion can face up to seven years of jail time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Friday, police asked employers to get their domestic workers to speak to a medical professional if they were pregnant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hong Kong hosts some 368,000 foreign domestic workers, according to government statistics.

But, even by his standards, the demand that the leader of a private company resign is extraordinary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Moorhead said other tech executives who had found themselves in Trump's crosshairs had come up with ways to \"kiss the ring\", pointing to promises from firms such as Apple and OpenAI to make large investments in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Intel probably misread the room on how important it was to get in and be visible with the White House,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to critics who said Trump had gone too far, the White House told the BBC: \"President Trump remains fully committed to safeguarding our country's national and economic security. This includes ensuring that iconic American companies in cutting-edge sectors are led by men and women who Americans can trust.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Tan's ties to China had been spotlighted in a 2024 congressional report examining links between US investment firms and Chinese businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They were also the subject of a Reuters investigation in April, which found that he had invested at least $200 in hundreds of Chinese companies, some of which are linked to the Chinese military. The investments were made either personally or though his funds between 2012 and December 2024. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, a Trump ally, took up the attack on Mr Tan on Thursday, criticising Intel for delays in its plans for chip manufacturing in the US.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the clash with Trump could add to the challenges the firm, along with US chip manufacturing, currently faces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Intel has been a hope for America to build out more chip capacity and has struggled to do so to date,\" said Janet Egan, senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. \"It's important that we get continuity of leadership to support that ramping up of capacity.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And when asked the following day whether he was giving Israel a \"green light\", he instead spoke about the US strikes on Iran earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Washington's Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was even more direct - and his answer was that Netanyahu's Gaza plan is not America's concern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" he said. \"Certainly, if they ask for wisdom, counsel, advice, I'm sure the president would offer it. But ultimately, it's the decision that the Israelis and only the Israelis can make.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has faced some opposition to his plan - notably from the Chief of Staff Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to Israeli media, had argued against a full-scale occupation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the event, an announcement after a meeting of Israel's security cabinet did not say Israel would take control of the entire territory of the Gaza Strip, but rather that it would \"prepare for taking control of Gaza City\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It did, however, mention that one of five principles for ending the war was \"Israeli security control in the Gaza Strip\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some have suggested a full takeover of Gaza has always been on the table. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Netanyahu had always planned to take over Gaza, he just was waiting for the right moment,\" Amin Saikal, emeritus professor of Middle Eastern, Central Asian and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has suggested Israel does not want to keep the territory, however, but \"hand it over to Arab forces\" - without specifying which. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the plan, however, the Trump administration is not giving Netanyahu any public indication that he is wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That represents a marked change in White House policy. Trump previously had been more than willing to outline his views on Gaza's future - even when it caught Netanyahu and the Israelis by surprise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In February, just weeks into his second presidential term, he said the US could be deeply involved in the reconstruction of Gaza as a global resort and suggested Palestinians might have to be relocated outside of the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And while the US joined Israel in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities in the brief clash between the two nations in June, Trump publicly and forcefully pressured Israel to abide by the ceasefire that ended that conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Americans also expressed their unhappiness with Israeli attacks on Syria last month - publicly disapproving, while offering even sharper criticism in private.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Bibi acted like a madman,\" a White House official told the news website Axios. \"He bombs everything all the time.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: 'Chilling' aerial video shows Gaza in ruins</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House has also been invested in ending the Gaza War, even pressuring Netanyahu for a ceasefire before Trump took office in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Steve Witkoff, the real estate magnate with a broad diplomatic portfolio in the Trump White House, has been the point person for these negotiations, seeking to broker a permanent ceasefire along with the release of the remaining hostages taken by Hamas in its 7 October 2023 attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As recently as a month ago, the White House was optimistic that a deal was within reach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire,\" Witkoff said on 8 July, adding that it could lead to a \"lasting peace in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But just over two weeks later, ceasefire talks had collapsed, and Witkoff was publicly accusing Hamas of being selfish and not acting in good faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Hamas didn't really want to make a deal,\" Trump said on 25 July. \"I think they want to die, and it's very, very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's comments - and his decision to abandon talks with Hamas and stay ambivalent about what could represent a massive new Israeli military operation - could be a ploy designed to force the Palestinian group to make new concessions at the negotiating table.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, that will become apparent soon enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The Trump administration has got a lot of leverage, \" said Prof Saikal of the Australian National University. \"I think Netanyahu would not make this move unless he had some sort of consent or tacit support from Washington.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This American change of course from public disapproval to obvious distancing could, however, also be part of an effort by the president to return to his non-interventionist outlook - a position he temporarily abandoned during the Iranian strikes, much to the consternation of parts of his political base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's increasing concern that this is inconsistent with an America-first policy, getting the United States deeper and deeper into this horrible war is not something that the president ran for office on,\" Frank Lowenstein, special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations during the Barack Obama administration, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But for the time being, anyway, I think Trump is going to let Netanyahu do whatever he wants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If so, Trump's position stands in stark contrast to the recent statements by France, the UK and Canada on recognising a Palestinian state. These moves were designed to bring additional pressure on Israel to wind down its military operations and reach a negotiated settlement with Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That diplomatic recognition, as well as America's studied indifference to the prospect of a long - and possibly indefinite - Israeli military occupation, take the US and its allies in markedly different directions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both represent a tacit acknowledgement that the current situation is untenable, and that a negotiated peace is further away than ever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With Trump, there is no telling how long this trend will last. But by the time Trump changes course again, Israel could be well down a path in Gaza that will be very difficult to reverse.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Paul Biya</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 92, Paul Biya is the world's oldest serving head of state. He has been in power for nearly 43 years since 1982. Biya leads the ruling CPDM party which dominates the political scene. He is widely considered the favourite, now that his main rival, Kamto, is out of the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The veteran politician has never lost an election since the return of multi-party politics in 1990. However, his victories have been marred by allegations of vote rigging – claims which his party and the government have continuously denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing his intention to run, Biya said his eighth mandate would focus on the wellbeing of women and young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"2.-bello-bouba-maigari\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">2. Bello Bouba Maigari</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bello Bouba Maigari, 78, is an experienced politician who hails from Cameroon's vote-rich northern region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the president of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) party founded in 1990. He served in the governments of both of Cameroon's presidents -Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In fact, he was Biya's first prime minister between 1982 and 1983. Since 1997, Maigari has forged an alliance with Biya's CPDM party that helped the latter clinch significant votes from the north. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, this political marriage ended in June following pressure from within his party to run independently. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While serving as Minister of State for Tourism and Leisure, Maigari announced his resignation and declared himself a candidate against Biya, who he also faced in the 1992 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"3.-issa-tchiroma-bakary\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">3.

This time around, Muna, a staunch international anti-corruption lawyer, says he wants to challenge Biya himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 72-year-old is from a family of politicians - his late father Solomon Tandeng Muna served as Prime Minister of West Cameroon after independence, Vice-President of the then Federal Republic of Cameroon and Speaker of the National Assembly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Speaker, Solomon Muna swore in Biya when he took over as president after Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Muna is promising to rid the bilingual country of the corruption and bad governance that he says have soiled its image at the international scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"6.-joshua-osih\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">6.

Since becoming a member of parliament in the process, he has challenged the government on key policy issues, promising sweeping changes if he takes over the reins of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Dr Hugues says Libii's vision is opaque, citing Akere Muna as a more convincing candidate with a much clearer project for the nation of nearly 30 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Muna has a wealth of international experience and diplomatic character, and that is what the nation needs now,\" he said, while praising the renowned lawyer's five-year transition plan to \"put the nation back on track\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Could the opposition unite?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Historically, Cameroon's opposition has been fragmented especially during elections, with analysts saying this has disadvantaged them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of this year's presidential election, there has been much talk about the need for the opposition to unite and harmonise strategies to take on Biya. But with each candidate prioritising their own interests, it remains unclear if most – let alone all – of them would work together, despite the risk this could help the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It might be the end of their political careers, or their parties, if they don't come together,\" said civil society leader Felix Agbor Balla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Kamto and the others must look for someone in the opposition who can carry the baton – and they must put the nation first, rise above their personal ego to look for a consensual candidate that can give the CPDM a run on the 12th of October,\" he told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1d24/live/c9479db0-73a4-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu via Getty Images Protesters gather at Place de la Republique in Paris on May 31, 2025, at the call of the Cameroonian diaspora.

The treated water was by definition safe to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem was that under EU law, \"natural mineral water\" – which sells at a huge premium over tap water – is supposed to be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle. That is the whole point of it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If brands like Evian, Vichy and Perrier have been so successful in France and around the world, it is thanks to an appealing image of mountain-sides, rushing streams, purity and health-giving minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Admit filtering the water, and the industry risks breaking the market spell.  Consumers might begin to ask what they'd been paying for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Complicating matters for Perrier and its parent company Nestlé – as well as President Emmanuel Macron's government – is the charge that executives and ministers conspired to keep the affair quiet, covered up reports of contamination, and re-wrote the rules so that Perrier could continue using micro-filtration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their investigations, Le Monde and Radio France alleged that the government considered the mineral water industry so strategic that it agreed to suppress damaging information. A senate inquiry into the affair accused the government of a \"deliberate strategy\" of \"dissimulation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to the allegations, the government has asked the European Commission to rule on what level of micro-filtration is permissible for \"natural mineral water\". Aurelien Rousseau, who was head of Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne's cabinet at the time, admitted there had been an \"error of appreciation\" but insisted there was never any risk to public health.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3507/live/d2ed7db0-6e1a-11f0-aa33-1bf5e0b3ec8e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images French Senator Alexandre Ouizille (C), flanked by French Senators Laurent Burgoa (L) and Antoinette Guhl (R), presents the Senate commission of enquiry report about French industrial mineral waters during a press conference at the French Senate, Upper house of the French Parliament, in Paris on May 19, 2025\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">A senate report concluded that France's government covered up the water scandal \"at the highest level\" </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, at the senate hearing into the industry, Nestlé's CEO Laurent Freixe admitted that Perrier had indeed used illicit methods to treat its water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also had another admission: that an official hydrologists' report into the company's historic site in the Gard department in southern France had recommended against renewing \"natural mineral water\" status for the company's output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It raises the possibility that for the first time in its 160-year history, Perrier water may soon not be labelled as what people assume it to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the hydrologist Emma Haziza, \"the link to climate change and global warming is absolutely established\". And if Perrier is feeling the impact ahead of other companies, it is probably because its geographical location sets it apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Far from the remote mountain landscape you might imagine, Perrier's water is pumped from deep aquifers in the coastal plain between Nîmes and Montpellier, a short drive from the Mediterranean. The area is populous, heavily-farmed, and very hot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There has been a big climatic shift since 2017,\" says Haziza. \"For five years there was a succession of droughts, which were particularly badly felt in the south.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Emma Haziza says climate change is causing a lot of problems in the south of France</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All the aquifers were affected. This means not just the upper water-table, which is where everyday tap water comes from. We can now see that the deeper aquifers – which the companies thought were protected – are also being hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The unforeseen is taking place. We are moving from a period in which companies could draw water from the deep aquifers and be sure they would be replenished, to a period in which it's obvious the whole system cannot go on.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The analysis made by Haziza and other hydrologists is that there is now a clear link between deeper and surface aquifers. Contaminants (farm chemicals or human waste) that drain off the land in the increasingly frequent flash floods, can now make their way into the lower aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, the effects of long-term drought and over-pumping mean these lower aquifers contain less volume, so any contamination will be more concentrated, the experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can foresee that what has happened first at Perrier's site will happen to other producers in the years to come. That's why we need to move away from our current model of consumption,\" says Haziza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong insists their water is \"100%\" pure</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year at the Perrier site, three million bottles had to be destroyed because of a contamination. But the company insists that any problems are swiftly detected; and it disputes the claim that contaminants are entering the deep aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are pumping water from 130 metres underground, beneath layers of limestone,\" says Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong. \"We are 100% convinced of the purity of the water. And its mineral make-up is constant.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says there is no EU ruling that specifically bans micro-filtration. The relevant text simply says that nothing must be done to disinfect or alter the mineral make-up of the water. The argument is over at what measure of micro-filtration alteration begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The original Perrier source was first tapped by a local doctor in the 1860s, but it was under British management that the brand took off 50 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">St John Harmsworth – brother of newspaper magnates Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere – made Perrier a byword for mineral water across the British empire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to company lore, Harmsworth took inspiration for the bottles' bulbous shape from the Indian clubs he used for exercise following a crippling car accident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today the bottling plant at Vergèze is still next to Harmsworth's residence and the original source. The plant has been heavily automated. A rail track connects with the SNCF network to bring hundreds of millions of cans and bottles every year to Marseille for export.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier's bottling plant is still next to the water's original source at Vergèze</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The focus for the last year has been on a new brand: Maison Perrier. These energy and flavoured drinks are proving highly successful in France and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The advantage for Perrier is that the new beverages do not claim to be \"natural mineral water\".

Israel regularly identifies and targets Hamas salary distributors, seeking to disrupt the group's ability to govern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Employees, from police officers to tax officials, often receive an encrypted message on their own phones or their spouses' instructing them to go to a specific location at a specific time to \"meet a friend for tea\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the meeting point, the employee is approached by a man - or occasionally a woman - who discreetly hands over a sealed envelope containing the money before vanishing without further interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An employee at the Hamas Ministry of Religious Affairs, who doesn't want to give his name for safety reasons, described the dangers involved in collecting his wages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time I go to pick up my salary, I say goodbye to my wife and children. I know that I may not return,\" he said. \"On several occasions, Israeli strikes have hit the salary distribution points. I survived one that targeted a busy market in Gaza City.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Alaa, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, is a schoolteacher employed by the Hamas-run government and the sole provider for a family of six.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I received 1,000 shekels (about $300) in worn-out banknotes - no trader would accept them. Only 200 shekels were usable - the rest, I honestly don't know what to do with,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"After two-and-a-half months of hunger, they pay us in tattered cash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm often forced to go to aid distribution points in the hope of getting some flour to feed my children. Sometimes I succeed in bringing home a little, but most of the time I fail.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March the Israeli military said they had killed the head of Hamas's finances, Ismail Barhoum, in a strike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. They accused him of channelling funds to Hamas's military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It remains unclear how Hamas has managed to continue funding salary payments given the destruction of much of its administrative and financial infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One senior Hamas employee, who served in high positions and is familiar with Hamas's financial operations, told the BBC that the group had stockpiled approximately $700m in cash and hundreds of millions of shekels in underground tunnels prior to the group's deadly 7 October 2023 attack in southern Israel, which sparked the devastating Israeli military campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These were allegedly overseen directly by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed - both of whom have since been killed by Israeli forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Anger at reward for Hamas supporters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas has historically relied on funding from heavy import duties and taxes imposed on Gaza's population, as well as receiving millions of dollars of support from Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing which operates through a separate financial system, is financed mainly by Iran. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A senior official from the banned Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, one of the most influential Islamist organisations in the world, has said that around 10% of their budget was also directed to Hamas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In order to generate revenue during the war, Hamas has also continued to levy taxes on traders and has sold large quantities of cigarettes at inflated prices up to 100 times their original cost. Before the war, a box of 20 cigarettes cost $5 - that has now risen to more than $170.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to cash payments, Hamas has distributed food parcels to its members and their families via local emergency committees whose leadership is frequently rotated due to repeated Israeli strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That has fuelled public anger, with many residents in Gaza accusing Hamas of distributing aid only to its supporters and excluding the wider population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid that has entered Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year, something Hamas denies. However BBC sources in Gaza have said that significant quantities of aid were taken by Hamas during this time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nisreen Khaled, a widow left caring for three children after her husband died of cancer five years ago, told the BBC: \"When the hunger worsened, my children were crying not only from pain but also from watching our Hamas-affiliated neighbours receive food parcels and sacks of flour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Are they not the reason for our suffering?

Now that looks increasingly difficult, if not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So what went wrong?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A series of missteps, grandstanding, geopolitics and domestic political pressure seem to have broken down the negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi has been restrained in its response so far to Trump's tirades, hoping that diplomacy might eventually help secure a trade deal. But in Trump's White House, there are no guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has commented on many issues that Delhi considers red lines. The biggest among them is Trump repeatedly putting <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwq0y7d14lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">India and its rival Pakistan on an equal footing</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Oil tanker trucks outside an oil refinery operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp.

He went as far as saying that some day, Pakistan might sell oil to India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another constant irritant for Delhi is Trump's repeated assertion that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India sees its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as its internal affair and has always rejected third-party mediation on the issue. Most world leaders have been sensitive to Delhi's position, including Trump in his first stint as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that's no longer the case. The US president has doubled down on his claim even after Modi told India's parliament that \"no country had mediated in the ceasefire\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi didn't name Trump or the US but domestic political pressure is mounting on him not to \"bow down\" to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The fact that this is happening against the backdrop of heavy and high-level US engagement with Islamabad immediately after an India-Pakistan conflict is even more galling for Delhi and the wider Indian public. This all sharpens concerns harboured by some in India that the US can't truly be trusted as a partner,\" says Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that some of the anger in Delhi might \"be Cold War-era baggage coming to the fore\", but \"this time around it's intensified by real-time developments as well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi's government thrives on nationalist issues, so its supporters would likely expect a firm response to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a Catch-22 situation - Delhi still wants to clinch a deal but also doesn't want to come across as buckling under Trump's pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it appears that Delhi is gradually releasing the restraint. In its response to Washington's anger over India's purchase of Russian oil, Delhi vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard its \"national interests and economic security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question is why Trump, who loved India's hospitality and called it a great country earlier, has gone on a tirade against a trusted ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts see his insults as a pressure tactic to secure a deal that he thinks works for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is a real estate magnate and a tough negotiator. His style may not be diplomatic, but he seeks the outcomes diplomats would. So, I think what he's doing is part of a negotiating strategy,\" says Jitendra Nath Misra, a former Indian ambassador and now a professor at OP Jindal Global University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A source in the Indian government said that Delhi gave many concessions to Washington, including no tariffs on industrial goods, and a phased reduction of tariffs on cars and alcohol.

This is critical for domestic political reasons,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also believes that Trump's insistence that India stop importing oil from Moscow has more to do with his <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj4wn1j7w1jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">growing frustration</a> over Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We're seeing Trump continuing to ratchet up his pressure tactics, trying to cut Russia off from its most important oil buyers by penalising them for doing business with Moscow,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Delhi can't afford to stop importing oil from Russia overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India is already the world's third biggest consumer of crude and may surpass China in the top position by 2030 as its energy demand is likely to increase with a fast-growing middle class, according to International Energy Agency (IEA).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia now accounts for more than 30% of India's total oil imports, a significant jump from less than 1% in 2021-22.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many in the West see this as India indirectly funding Moscow's war but Delhi denies this, arguing that buying Russian oil at a discount ensures energy security for millions of its citizens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India also sees Russia as its \"all-weather\" ally. Moscow has traditionally come to Delhi's rescue during past crises and still enjoys support among the wider Indian public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moscow is also Delhi's biggest arms supplier, though its share in India's defence import portfolio dropped to 36% between 2020-25 from 55% between 2016 and 2020, according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was largely due to Delhi boosting domestic manufacturing and buying more from the US, France and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Russia's role in India's defence strategy can't be overstated. This is something the West understood and didn't challenge - until Trump decided to break from established norms.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/596e/live/92b296f0-72b5-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NASA An artist's concept shared by Nasa on X of what the Nisar satellite will look like\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">NASA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Last month, India and the US jointly launched the Nisar satellite</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So far, India was able to successfully walk the diplomatic tightrope with the West overlooking its strong ties to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US has long viewed India as a bulwark against China's dominance in the Indo-Pacific region, which ensured bipartisan support for Delhi in Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And Moscow (though sometimes reluctantly) didn't react harshly to its ally forging close ties with Washington and other western countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But now Trump has challenged this position. How Delhi reacts will decide the future of the India-US relationship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has been measured in its response so far but is not holding back completely. In its statement, it said that the US had encouraged it to keep buying oil from Russia for global energy market stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also said that targeting it was unjustified as the EU continues to buy energy, fertiliser, mining and chemical products from Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things seem bad, some analysts say that all is not lost. India and the US have close links in many sectors, which can't be uprooted overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries cooperate closely in the space technology, IT, education and defence sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many large domestic IT firms have invested heavily in the US, and most big Silicon Valley firms have operations in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think the fundamentals of the relationship are not weak. It's a paradox that the day Trump announced 25% tariffs and unspecified penalties, India and the US collaborated in a strategic area when an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy98jnreqvvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Indian rocket sent a jointly-developed satellite into space</a>,\" says Mr Misra. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It will be interesting to see how India reacts to Trump's sharp rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is unapologetically transactional and commercial in his approach to foreign policy. He has no compunction about deploying these potentially alienating harsh tactics against a close US partner like India,\" says Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he adds that there's a lot of trust baked into the partnership, given the work that has gone into it over the past two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So what's lost can potentially be regained. But because of the extent of the current malaise, it could take a long time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
