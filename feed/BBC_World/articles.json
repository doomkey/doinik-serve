An advisory means there is the potential for strong currents or dangerous waves, with people urged to stay out of the water. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although residents are able to return to their homes, officials warn the risk of powerful currents can continue for several hours or days after the initial waves, and have urged people to stay out of the water.   </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US seismologist Dr Lucy Jones earlier anticipated that the waves could damage harbours and waterfront properties in Hawaii - and possibly in California - but would not cause a catastrophic loss of life in the Americas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The tallest waves were nearly six feet high in Hawaii.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Dr Jones noted that by comparison they reached 42ft (13m) during a deadly tsunami in Japan in 2011.</p></div><div data-component=\"group-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><section class=\"sc-2d9149e5-0 eCkEkB\"><div data-testid=\"slideshowWrapper\" class=\"sc-bb9c31df-0 dggBDl\"><hr class=\"sc-bb9c31df-13 hrKJGZ\"><div class=\"sc-bb9c31df-9 sc-bb9c31df-12 eeluXM loEoAe\"><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CElMi kHUruh IBZuX eEMItS\"></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-11 CElMi eodkdk dRItIX\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Hotel guests stand on balconies at a resort in Honolulu, looking out towards Waikiki Beach, after the tsunami warnings rang out</figcaption></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CElMi kHUruh IBZuX eEMItS\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">One-way traffic was heavy as people evacuated coastal areas</figcaption></p></div></div></section></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many Hawaiians were taking no chances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Residents on Maui, which was devastated by wildfires two years ago, were among those who moved to higher ground while the warning was in place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">David Dorn told the BBC that he was no stranger to tsunami warnings, having lived a block away from the ocean in the coastal city of Kihei, on Maui, for 30 years. But he and his wife were treating this one differently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We try and take them all seriously, but most people kind of take them a bit lightly,\" he said of the warning sirens that had been blaring since the first alert was issued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He and his wife had evacuated to higher ground and were planning to spend the night in their van at an inland shopping centre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Dorn said that before leaving their home, he had moved his electronics up to their loft, hoping that even if seawater penetrates the building it would not reach the rafters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His biggest concern was the roads, especially if electrical poles fell and blocked them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Traffic's always a problem, and its getting worse.

Late on Tuesday, she again found herself moving to higher ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Johnson, 47, had watched the water level recede and then rise significantly - describing a pattern typically seen with tsunamis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's eerily weird,\" she exclaimed, while packing her truck to spend a night with her family and friends in the mountains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She compared the situation to the fire that hit the town of Lahaina two years ago, devastating the island and its community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All I can do is leave the house. I'm leaving, so I'm definitely worried something's coming. But I mean, what can you cry about?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We went through this with the fires, and there was no warning, and it was just so devastating.

A 3.6ft wave was recorded in Crescent City, in the far north of the state, with smaller waves of 1.6ft hitting Arena Cove, north of San Francisco, and further down the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of potentially higher crests in one section of the Pacific coast near Port San Luis, roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The NWS Los Angeles office posted: \"Do not return to inundated areas as waters will recede, but could return multiple times through the next 24 hours, and the first wave may not be the largest.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At one point the agency's San Francisco office said it was recording tidal swings of up to 2.5ft in as little as 15 minutes and advised: \"It's just a good idea to stay away from the water today!\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles County, however, some were relaxed about the threat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">George Mejia, 25, and his two cousins were packing up their longboards in their convertible when his mom called.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"She said, 'Did you see there was a huge earthquake and there's maybe gonna be a tsunami?' I was like, 'No, I've been in the water!'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead of speeding off, the trio sat in their car and peered out at the ocean, talking about heading back in and riding tsunami waves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Blue tsunami evacuation route signs line many roads along the US west coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Canada, wave heights have so far remained below 1ft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And a tsunami advisory on the island of Guam, a US territory about 2,500km south of Tokyo, was cancelled. Island officials said there was no further threat of waves, but warned of stronger currents over the next day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The earthquake that triggered the tsunami is one of the most powerful of modern times. Since modern seismography began in 1900, only five earthquakes have been stronger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-by-christal-hayes\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">With additional reporting by Christal Hayes</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

The clean-up is also estimated to cost around 21.5tr yen ($145bn; 3109bn). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this week, Tepco said the start of full-scale removal of melted fuel debris would be pushed back until 2037 or later - saying that preparations for this would require at least 12-15 years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plan has already been delayed numerous times, and the latest delay is a major setback to a government plan to complete decommissioning by 2051.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tepco still maintains that it can achieve this but some experts have called this into question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Who really believes all 880 tons of debris can be removed in 14 years between 2037 and 2051? Maintaining an unrealistic goal is not good when considering Fukushima's recovery,\" Shunji Matsuoka, a professor of environmental economics and policy studies at Waseda University, had told local news outlet Asahi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And then there's the issue of water. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since the disaster, power plant operator Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (Tepco)  has been pumping in water to cool down the reactors' fuel rods. This means every day the plant produces contaminated water, which is stored in more than 1,000 tanks, enough to fill more than 500 Olympic swimming pools. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Japan needs the land occupied by the tanks to build new facilities to safely decommission the plant - and in 2023, it began releasing some of this treated wastewater into the ocean. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The plan was met by a huge amount of criticism and controversy, despite the UN's atomic regulators saying it will have a \"negligible\" impact on people and the environment. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Is Japan shifting back to nuclear power? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Japan initially started moving away from nuclear energy - but the government has slowly started to reverse this policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this year, Japan said it needed to rely on nuclear to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors, with an energy plan released calling for \"maximising\" nuclear energy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And this week, utility company Kansai Electric Power said it would look into whether it could build a new reactor - a project that had been suspended in the wake of Fukushima. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there has been local opposition to such plans - and Wednesday's tsunami alert is likely to heighten concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan's Meteorological Agency says tsunami waves have reached parts of the country's coast, including Fukushima.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Waves could reach as high as 3m (9ft) in such areas and thousands have been told to evacuate for their safety. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/31aa/live/dd7b56e0-6d29-11f0-8bda-310deb9e6bbf.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman watches a television broadcast of a tsunami warning for much of coastal Japan following a 8.7 magnitude quake in the sea off eastern Russia\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Wednesday's tsunami alert is likely to heighten concerns in Japan </figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why do so many earthquakes happen in Japan? </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan's precarious location on the Ring of Fire means it experiences about 1,500 earthquakes a year.

The US president has repeatedly taken aim at India's high tariffs, branding it a \"tariff king\" and a \"big abuser\" of trade ties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has not yet sent a letter to India setting a new tariff rate - as he has with more than a dozen other trading partners.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Back in April, Trump had announced <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c367p03059yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">tariffs of up to 27% on Indian goods</a>, which was later paused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, both sides have been racing to negotiate an agreement, with officials sometimes sounding positive and at other times, measured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We continue to speak with our Indian counterparts.

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nearly half of the company's products are made in Asian countries which recently agreed trade deals with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing its latest results, Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said the tariffs \"will directly increase the cost of our products for the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He admitted that the company still does not know what the impact will be on customer demand \"should all these tariffs cause major inflation\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two largest source countries for Adidas goods are Vietnam, which makes 27% of the sportswear brand's products, and Indonesia, which makes 19%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier this month, the US struck trade deals with both countries, agreeing to impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 19% tariff on Indonesian-made products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US companies that ship in Adidas products to sell in America have to pay the tariff. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sportswear giant, which makes the popular Gazelle and Samba trainers, had previously warned that it cannot produce most of its products in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Its rival Nike in May also said it would raise prices on some trainers and clothing for US customers from June, and later warned the tariffs could <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8d6gpnmvq6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">add about $1bn (£730m) to its costs</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Adidas boss Mr Gulden said US tariffs have already impacted the company but he said the latest indications point to tariffs directly increasing \"the cost of our products for the US with up to €200m during the rest of the year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite the impact of tariffs, Adidas reported a 7.3% increase in sales to €12.1bn in the first half of the year with pre-tax profit jumping from €549m to €1bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Footwear sales increased

sealed a deal with the European Union (EU) to impose 15% tariffs on all imports, including cars ahead of a 1 August deadline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has previously threatened a 30% US

Germany's best-known carmakers outlined how US tariffs had hit their businesses so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mercedes-Benz said the tariffs, which the company expects to cost it nearly

Some of the projects will include mining projects or infrastructure projects where a full assessment is needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will also cause deforestation. Modifications or continuations of projects might mean deforestation in the Amazon without a proper assessment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A lot of deforestation and land-clearing in the Amazon has been driven by agriculture and mining, sometimes illegally - but Ms Riaño said the bill is \"going backwards\" on efforts to prevent that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Her intervention comes two months after new analysis was published <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0lnngl6713o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">showing vast swathes of the Amazon were destroyed in 2024</a>, with forest fires fuelled by drought adding to man-made deforestation pressures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the new law, environmental agencies would have 12 months - extendable to 24 - to make a decision about whether to grant a licence for strategic projects. If that deadline was missed, a licence could be automatically granted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Supporters say this would give businesses certainty by preventing delays that have plagued projects, including hydroelectric dams for clean energy, or rail lines to transport grain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Riaño said she understood the need for more efficient systems but assessments must be \"comprehensive\" and \"based on the science.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The law would also relax the requirement to consult indigenous or traditional quilombola communities - descendents of Afro-Brazilian slaves - in some situations unless they are directly impacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">UN experts raised concerns that fast-tracking assessments could remove some participation and affect human rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Supporters of the bill say it will encourage economic development, including for renewable energy projects, held to grow the economy, and reduce costs for businesses and the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But critics fear weakening environmental protections could increase the risk of environmental disasters and violate indigenous rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In particular, UN experts argue it could contradict constitutional rights guaranteeing the right to an ecologically balanced environment - which means legal challenges could lie ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Senate and Chamber of Deputies have approved the bill and it is now pending presidential approval.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Lula da Silva has until 8 August to decide whether to approve or veto the new law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Brazil's Environment and Climate Change minister, Marina Silva, has strongly opposed the bill, condemning it as a \"death blow\" to environmental protections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But she has been at odds with the president on other issues in the past, including proposals to explore oil drilling in the Amazon basin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even if the president vetoes it, there is a chance the conservative-leaning congress could try to overturn that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Brazil's Climate Observatory has called the bill the \"biggest environmental setback\" since Brazil's military dictatorship, in which the construction of roads and agricultural expansion led to increased Amazon deforestation and the displacement of many indigenous people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Riaño said scientists in Brazil estimate the bill \"will lift protections for more than 18 million hectares in the country, the size of Uruguay,\" adding \"the consequences are huge\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

It said it wanted to put pressure on the armed group to release its Israeli hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The blockade was partially eased after 11 weeks, after the Israeli government came under pressure from its allies, but the shortages of food, medicine and fuel have worsened.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has insisted there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is \"no starvation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, it has announced in recent days measures aimed at helping the UN and its partners collect aid from crossings and distribute it within Gaza, including daily \"tactical pauses\" in military operations in three areas and designated corridors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC says immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for an unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report does not formally classify Gaza as being in a famine, saying that can only be made through analysis that will be conducted \"without delay\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC - a global initiative by UN agencies, aid groups and governments - is the primary mechanism the international community uses to conclude whether a famine is happening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Households are classified as IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) if they experience an extreme lack of food, starvation and exhaustion of coping strategies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a famine to be officially declared in a specific area, there must be evidence that:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 fusmZA\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">At least 20% of households are in Phase 5</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">At least 30% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 huNRXw\">There are two deaths for every 10,000 inhabitants per day, or four child deaths out of 10,000 children, \"due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease\"</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May, the IPC warned the entire population of Gaza was facing high levels of acute food insecurity and that 470,000 people (22%) were facing \"catastrophic\" levels, or Phase 5.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC alert issued on Tuesday says the intensification of the Israeli military's bombardment and expansion of its ground operations over the past two months have had a \"devastating impact\" on civilians and critical infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">People's access to food across Gaza has also become \"alarmingly erratic and extremely perilous\" during the same period, it adds, noting the UN has recorded the killing of more than 1,000 people seeking aid by Israeli forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The IPC says malnutrition has been rising rapidly in the first half of July and has reached the famine threshold in Gaza City.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It cites the Gaza Nutrition Cluster -

No, the contrary is right.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Saar said 5,000 aid lorries had entered Gaza over the last two months, and that Israel was making \"amazing efforts, including this week, by opening these humanitarian corridors, by airdrops by any possible means\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli military body Cogat, which co-ordinates the entry of aid into Gaza, said more than 200 lorry loads were collected from crossings by the UN and other international organisations on Monday, and hundreds more were awaiting collection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Gaza residents said they had seen little to no improvement in the availability of food since Israel announced the new measures to facilitate aid distribution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"[On Monday] they airdropped a very small amount of aid in our area. Thousands of people fought over it,\" mother-of-two Bakr Salah, 35, a nurse at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"My children are starving. They have not eaten a single meal for two days. We keep hearing about aid coming in, but we never see any of it,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the southern city of Khan Younis, Bilal Atallah, a 45-year-old father of five, said he had spent all of Monday waiting for food aid without success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I had no choice but to buy flour from the looters who had stolen it from aid lorries,\" he said. \"It cost me $35 (£26) for 1kg (2.2lb) of flour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Other Gaza residents also reported that criminal gangs were intercepting and looting aid convoys, and then reselling supplies at unaffordable prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The UN's humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said most UN lorries that entered Gaza on Sunday were looted, but said it was by \"desperate individual civilians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of stealing aid. However, the New York Times cited senior Israeli military officials as saying on Sunday that the military had never found proof that the armed group had systematically stolen aid from the UN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Reuters news agency also reported last week that internal US government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft by Hamas of US-funded aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 60,034 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Her family had also been taking care of her pets: eight cats and three dogs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Their village is small and remote, with just around 10 households, she said, adding that she feared rescuers might miss it altogether.

One of the deadliest in recent memory occurred in July 2012, when 190mm of rain drenched the city in a day, killing 79 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This summer, floods have wreaked havoc across swathes of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two people were killed and 10 people went missing in Shandong province earlier this month when Typhoon Wipha struck eastern China. Two weeks earlier, a landslide killed three people in Ya'an city, southwestern China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Extreme weather, which experts link to climate change, has increasingly threatened China's residents and economy - especially its trillion-dollar agriculture sector.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Natural disasters in the first half of the year have cost China 54.11 billion yuan ($7.5bn; £5.7bn), its emergency management ministry said earlier this month.

Authorities said 4m (13ft) waves flooded the port and a fish processing facility, and vessels had been swept from their moorings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A power grid was also damaged in Russia's Sakhalin region. The full extent of the damage remains unclear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia has lifted tsunami warnings for Sakhalin and Kamchatka, local officials said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Japan, about 1.9 million people were asked to evacuate and authorities urged residents to reach higher ground. Initial waves reaching the country have been relatively small, but its meteorological agency said they could grow to 3m (9.8ft). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Japan's weather agency has since downgraded all of its tsunami warnings to advisories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Hawaii, officials first warned of possible 10ft waves, but the tsunami warning covering the island has also now been downgraded to an advisory level, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This means there is the potential of strong waves, minor flooding and strong currents, but that a major tsunami is not expected to hit.

Some places it will be fairly minimal, some quite serious.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the extent of the impact depends largely on the path of energy radiating from Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. Areas directly in line with that energy - roughly southeast from the epicentre - are expected to be most affected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said it takes about \"eight to nine hours\" for a tsunami from Kamchatka to reach the US west coast.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What's the timeframe?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The earthquake struck at about 11:25am local time (00:25am BST) on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tsunami waves hit parts of North America's west coast at around 12.20am local time (09.20am BST).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A good rule of thumb for tsunami waves is that they travel at about the speed of a jet plane,\" Helen Janiszewski, assistant professor in geophysics and tectonics division at the University of Hawaii, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So if you think of how long it would take to travel by plane from one place to another, that is how long it takes for waves to travel from the quake epicentre to hit elsewhere,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">How does it compare to previous earthquakes?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was relatively shallow - striking at a depth of 20.7 km (12 miles), and centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was initially recorded as an 8.0 magnitude earthquake but later revised upwards.

UK recognition of Palestine looks \"irreversible,\" according to a senior British official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Starmer won't be expecting Britain's change of policy to produce an independent Palestinian state any time soon – from the perspective of many Israelis, the best time for it would be never – but the intention, diplomatic sources say, is to empower moderates on both sides, Israelis and Palestinians. The British hope they can jolt them into believing that peace might be possible.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It won't be easy, not just because of the way Hamas killed around 1,200 people, including hundreds of Israeli civilians, and took hostages on 7 October 2023, followed by Israel's vengeful response that has killed tens of thousands civilians and left Gaza in ruins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is also because every attempt to make peace has failed. Years of peace talks in the 1990s ended in bloodshed. Every attempt to revive them since then has collapsed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's rejection came minutes after Keir Starmer finished speaking in Downing Street. Later in the evening, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted a fiercely worded denunciation on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism and punishes its victims. A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu denies Israel has caused starvation and catastrophe in Gaza. Had he accepted Britain's conditions for a postponement, his government would have disintegrated. He depends on the support of ultra nationalist extremists who want to annex the occupied territories and force Palestinians out, not grant them independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Netanyahu is not their prisoner. He built a career opposing the two-state solution, the idea that peace can be built by creating an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Earlier this month he said a Palestinian state would be a 'launchpad' for more 7 October style attempts to destroy Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu will be hoping for the strong backing of the US government. Its position is that recognising a Palestinian state now rewards Hamas terrorism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Donald Trump told reporters as he flew back to the US after his golfing interlude in Scotland that he didn't support Britain's move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The issue of Palestinian sovereignty could become another factor cracking apart transatlantic relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Until the last few weeks Keir Starmer was not convinced the time was right to recognise Palestine. But pictures of Palestinian children in Gaza starving to death were the last straw after so much killing and devastation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Attitudes hardened in Downing Street and the Foreign Office, as well as in the Labour party and more widely in the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain's decision to join France in recognising Palestine is another sign of Israel's increasing diplomatic isolation. Two of its major western allies, the UK and France, both permanent members of the UN Security Council, have dismissed Israel's attempt to block their recognition of Palestine when the General Assembly meets in New York in September.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Jeremy Bowen: Recognising Palestinian state is a big change for British foreign policy</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In New York just after Starmer's statement, David Lammy, the UK foreign secretary, was given a big round of applause when he announced Britain's decision at the UN's conference on a two-state solution and recognition of a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His dismissed the accusation that Palestinian independence could be lethal for Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is no contradiction between support for Israel's security and support for Palestinian statehood. Indeed, the opposite is true.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Let me be clear: the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong – it's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A British official said the atmosphere was electric as Lammy told the delegates that the UK's announcement was being made \"with the hand of history on our shoulders.\" Lammy went on to delve into Britain's imperial past in Palestine which is deeply intertwined with the roots of the conflict between Jews and Arabs for control of the land Britain once ruled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain captured Jerusalem from the Ottoman Empire in 1917 and controlled Palestine until in 1948, exhausted and out of ideas to deal with what was then a full-scale war between Arabs and Jews, it handed over responsibility to the UN and left Palestine. Immediately, Israel's first prime minister David Ben Gurion declared independence, and Israel defeated an invasion by Arab armies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the UN David Lammy recalled how Arthur Balfour, his predecessor as foreign secretary had in 1917 signed a typewritten letter promising to 'view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people.'</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the document, known as the Balfour Declaration, also stated \"that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of non-Jewish communities in Palestine.\" It did not use the word Arab, but that is what was meant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lammy said Britain can be proud of the way it helped lay Israel's foundations, But the promise to Palestinians, Lammy said, was not kept, and that \"is a historical injustice which continues to unfold.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain's conflicting promises fuelled and shaped the conflict. A time traveller going back a century to Palestine in the 1920s would find the tension and violence depressingly familiar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The way the UK hopes to end the misery in Gaza, create peace in the Middle East and remedy the historical injustice Lammy described is to revive the two-state solution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The conference in New York at which he was speaking was chaired by France and Saudi Arabia. It has produced a seven-page document aimed at creating a way ahead to revive the two-state solution, which includes condemnation by Arab states of Hamas and its 7 October attacks on Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The window for peace through the two-state solution appeared to be locked shut after the collapse of the peace process that started with real hope in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Britain's decision to recognise Palestine is a diplomatic crowbar to try to reopen it.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Sign up here.</a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But then he turned to the right, saw him and fired, killing 36-year-old New York police officer Didarul Islam, who leaves behind two children and a pregnant wife, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"He was slain in the entryway to the right as soon as he entered the building,\" Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura wasted little time before firing at another woman taking cover behind a pillar, making his way through the lobby and continuing to shoot, authorities say. Wesley LePatner, who worked upstairs at financial firm Blackstone, was killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our prayers are with her husband, children and family,\" the company said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An NFL employee was \"seriously injured\" in the attack, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell wrote to staff. Craig Clementi, who worked in the finance department, was on his way home when he was shot, his father-in-law Robert Hunter told the New York Daily News. He is now recovering from surgery.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Mayor: New York gunman left note blaming NFL for brain injury</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A mistaken elevator ride</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the gunfire continued to ring out, another security guard tried in vain to activate an alarm system to disable the elevators, potentially preventing more carnage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the guard, Aland Etienne, was \"assassinated\" as he took cover behind the counter, Adams said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After that, the gunman headed to an elevator. As he waited for the lift, a woman emerged and somehow was allowed to exit unscathed, police said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the lift he boarded would not take him where he intended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He had gone to the wrong elevator bank and arrived, not at the NFL offices, but at the 33rd floor offices of the real-estate company that owned the building, Rudin Management. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: People seen evacuating NYC building with their hands raised</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Frantic emails and a run for help</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As chaos unfolded in the lobby, employees in the building sent frantic messages over email and Microsoft Teams that there was a shooter downstairs, a Blackstone worker told the Wall Street Journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Chen told ABC News that she was watching a presentation on the second floor of the skyscraper with about 150 other people when they heard the first shots.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Some went out in the back door, out onto the street,\" she said. \"Other people, including me, we ran into the conference room.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A photo circulating on social media appears to show Blackstone employees piling couches, desks and other furniture in front of a door in a panic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those in the NFL offices, meanwhile, received messages from the league warning them of gunfire, according to ESPN. Told to switch their phones to silent and hide until law enforcement arrived, they waited for a shooter who would never make it to his target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the plaza outside the Park Avenue tower, law enforcement flooded the scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nekeisha Lewis could hear the sounds of rapid gunfire from inside the skyscraper, while seated nearby with a friend. She could see the gunman through the glass, she told NBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before she knew it, someone ran from the building \"really hard\" toward them and began crying out for help, saying he'd been shot, Ms Lewis said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Because of how strongly he was running, I couldn't believe it. He had what looked like … an exit wound in the back.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She joined others, taking cover behind a wall.

He shot and killed his last victim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then, authorities said, he walked down a hallway and shot himself in the chest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura used an AR-15-style rifle he had assembled with a lower receiver - or gun frame - that an associate purchased for him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With teams in two states, investigators are still working to trace Tamura's trip  from Las Vegas to New York City. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A rambling three-page note was found on his body.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The gunman wrote he was suffering from CTE, a brain disease triggered by head injuries like those suffered in military combat and contact sports like American football. Officials also said Tamura had \"a documented mental health history\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tamura, who played football as a teenager - though not professionally, according to friends -  \"seemed to have blamed the NFL\", Mayor Adams said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Study my brain.

But the other one, seeing the cash, said: \"Shut up, do you know how much money that is?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They took almost everything - 2.66m roubles (£24,000).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The officers had no regard for Vladimir Putin's promises that those who decided to join Russia's war against Ukraine should be treated as heroes and \"the new elite\" upon their return.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Putin has relied on financial incentives to triple the size of the military</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In another case, several police officers who worked at a Moscow airport are suspected of tipping off taxi drivers about servicemen returning from the front.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The drivers would offer a reasonable fare, and then, after completing the ride, they would demand up to 15 times more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Those who resisted were threatened; some were allegedly drugged or intoxicated while the thieves used their bank cards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Investigators believe the gang took at least 1.5m roubles from returning soldiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sometimes salaries are stolen before the servicemen have even seen the money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In October 2024, police arrested three staff members of a recruitment centre in Vladimir region for stealing more than 11m roubles from soldiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The suspects got access to their salary accounts by keeping for themselves the sim cards that had been issued to the new recruits and were tied to the accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In another case, a local official from Belgorod region is suspected of stealing more than a million roubles from new recruits by linking their bank accounts to his own phone number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Sometimes soldiers have been robbed by their own commanders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One serviceman told the BBC his unit was denied access to shops and ordered to hand over their bank cards and PIN numbers to a sergeant major.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The officer allegedly ended up with 50 salary cards, many belonging to soldiers now listed as missing in action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the soldier we spoke to, he fled with the money .

We don't have clothes or shoes. Our situation is very bad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lawyers who have visited Amygdaleza confirm his account, describing recent arrivals walking barefoot on baking hot soil and receiving minimal information.

Greece itself did so previously in 2020 during an increase in arrivals from Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Certain obligations of the European Convention on Human Rights can be overridden \"in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whether the current situation constitutes such a grave threat to either Poland or Greece is much disputed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This article is for war or a massive uprising,\" argues Dimitris Fourakis, a lawyer who works extensively with migrants in Crete and sees a troubling trend across Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He warns that detention centres will quickly fill up, too, as \"sending migrants back\" is easy to say but extremely difficult to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think it's a decision that is completely illegal. It's a very big step, very wrong step.

It is caused by disturbed air in and around the jet stream, (a fast-moving wind at around six miles in the atmosphere, which is the same height as where planes cruise).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Wind speeds in the jet stream travelling from west to east across the Atlantic can vary from 160mph to 250mph. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is colder air to the north and warmer air to the south: this temperature difference and change in winds is useful for airliners to use as a tailwind to save time and fuel. But it also creates the turbulent air.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Climate change is warming the air to the south of the jet stream more than the air to the north so that temperature difference is being made stronger,\" explains Prof Williams. \"Which in turn is driving a stronger jet stream.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'It should worry us all'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The increase in severe turbulence - enough to lift you out of your seat - could potentially bring more incidents of injury, or possibly death in the most severe cases.

Israel told him his visa would not be renewed after he posted on social media a month ago that the GHF system had brought to Gaza \"conditions created to kill… what we are seeing is carnage. It is weaponised hunger. It is forced displacement. It's a death sentence for people just trying to survive. It appears to be the erasure of Palestinian life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After Israel announced its new measures, Whittall told the BBC that \"the humanitarian situation in Gaza has never been worse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said for Israel's new measures to change matters for the better it would have to reduce the time it takes to allow trucks to transit the crossings into Gaza and improve the routes provided by the IDF for the convoys to use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel would also need to provide \"meaningful assurances that the people gathering to take food off the back of the trucks won't be shot by Israeli forces\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whittall has been going in and out of Gaza since the war started, though that is now ending unless Israel decides not to withdraw his visa after all. He says that as IDF military operations continue \"there remains an abhorrent disregard for humanitarian law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant are already the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year, accused of joint criminal responsibility for \"the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\" Netanyahu, Gallant and the Israeli state deny the allegations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel released grainy footage of a transport plane dropping pallets of aid into Gaza. Lines of parachutes billowed out the back of the aircraft in the dark of the night. The IDF said it had delivered seven packages of aid containing flour, sugar and tinned food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In other wars I have seen aid being dropped, both from the aircraft themselves and close up on the ground as it lands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Air dropping aid is an act of desperation. It can also look good on television, and spread a feel-good factor that something, at last, is being done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is a crude process, that will not on its own do much to end hunger in Gaza. Only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long term aid operation can do that. Even big transport planes do not carry as much as a small convoy of lorries.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4fdb/live/e7516760-6afc-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA Palestinians try to grab bags of flour from an aid truck near Zikim, northern Gaza Strip on 27 July\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Palestinians try to grab bags of flour from an aid truck near Zikim, northern Gaza Strip on 27 July</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Iraqi Kurdistan, after the 1991 Gulf War, the US, UK and others dropped aid from C-130 transport aircraft, mostly army rations, sleeping bags and surplus winter uniforms to tens of thousands trying to survive in the open in mud and snow high in the mountains on Iraq's border with Turkey. I flew with them and watched British and American airmen dropping aid from the rear cargo ramps of the planes several thousand feet above the people who needed it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was welcome enough. But when a few days later when I managed to reach the improvised camps in the mountains, I saw young men running into minefields to get aid that landed there. Some were killed and maimed in explosions. I saw families killed when heavy pallets dropped on their tents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When Mostar was besieged during the war in Bosnia in 1993, I saw pallets of American military \"meals ready to eat\", dropped from high altitude, scattered all over the east side of the city that was being constantly shelled. Some aid pallets crashed through roofs that had somehow not been destroyed by artillery attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professionals involved in relief operations regard dropping aid from the sky as a last resort. They use it when any other access is impossible. That's not the case in Gaza. A short drive north is Ashdod, Israel's modern container port. A few more hours away is the Jordanian border, which has been used regularly as a supply line for aid for Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gaza was one of the world's most densely populated places before the war when the population of more than two million Palestinians had access to the entire strip. In British terms, the Gaza Strip is slightly smaller than the Isle of Wight. Compared to American cities, it's roughly the size of Philadelphia or Detroit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now Israel has forced most of Gaza's people into a tiny area on the southern coast, amounting to around 17% of Gaza's land. Most of them live in densely packed tents. It is not clear if there is even an open space for despatchers high in the sky to aim at.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pallets of aid dropped by parachute often land far from the people who need it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Each pallet will be fought over by desperate men trying to get food for their families, and by criminal elements who will want to sell it for profit.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But they were denied permission to unload the smoking, leaking container at ports in Qatar and India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The container had been leaking acid at a rate of about a litre an hour for at least eight days when it sailed into Sri Lankan waters late at night on 19 May 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It had requested emergency berthing - but by the morning the Singapore-flagged vessel was alight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Despite firefighting efforts from the crew, the Sri Lankan authorities and salvors, the fire spread throughout the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two weeks later, it sank, spilling its cargo and fuel into the sea around nine nautical miles off the country's south-west coast, between the capital Colombo and Negombo to the north.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Muditha Katuwawala shows tiny nurdles collected from a beach in Sri Lanka</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What happened next \"was just like out of a war movie\", says Muditha Katuwawala, an environmentalist and founder of the Pearl Protectors, a local NGO that volunteered to help the clean-up operation, which was run largely by Sri Lankan state authorities with funding from the ship's owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We started seeing turtles getting washed up with similar sorts of traits... the skin had burn marks [and] was peeling off. The nose and eyes were red and puffed up, and we saw dolphins washing up and... their skin was peeling off and red,\" Mr Katuwawala said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The nurdles on the beaches were \"like snow,\" he says, adding that \"it was horrifying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The clean-up began in earnest. At the start, Mr Katuwawala and his fellow volunteers \"were collecting like 300-400 kilos of nurdles\" each day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over time, it dropped to three to four kilograms in a couple of hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The nurdles were getting more dispersed, it was harder to see them as they got buried in the sand over time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It was decided the cost-benefit ratio was no longer worth the effort of mobilising volunteers. The groups stood down, leaving the task to state-organised local clean-up groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, scientists were getting concerned about the possibility the plastic pellets - already harmful to animals which eat them accidentally - may be getting more toxic, contaminated from the spill, or from other pollution sources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the ensuing years, they have collected samples which could help trace the effect over time. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The most heavily contaminated nurdles are those burnt in the fire, forensic chemists say</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In November 2024, the BBC and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://watershedinvestigations.com/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Watershed Investigations</a> sent more than 20 of those samples to a team of forensic chemists specialising in environmental pollution from Manchester Metropolitan University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They found the most heavily contaminated nurdles were those burnt in the fire, which leach metals toxic to aquatic life, like arsenic, lead, cadmium, copper, cobalt and nickel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The team also found the pellets \"still going round appear to be sucking up more pollution from the environment\" and were becoming \"more toxic\", according to Mr Megson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They will be ingested [and] will pass pollution on to marine organisms,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tests carried out on fish caught near the site of the disaster - as well as the nearby Negombo lagoon - found some contained the same pollutants that were present in the ship's cargo and on the nurdles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the fish contained levels of hazardous metals  - some of which were found in the disaster - which exceeded safe limits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Researchers say the disaster cannot be discounted as the source of contamination, although it also can't be directly proven to be the source, as it's not known if these fish ate nurdles, how many they ingested, or if the pollution came from other sources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But placed on top of everything else that is in that system, there's a really good likelihood that it's causing harm to the environment and also potentially harm to people and humans that are eating and relying on that marine ecosystem for a source of their food,\" Mr Megson adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local fishermen do draw the link to the disaster.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There's no fish since then. We've never had the same amount of fish that we used to catch,\" fisherman Jude Sulanta explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our lives have turned upside down. From the stretch where the ship sank up until here you don't get many new, young fish at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship's owner, X-Press Feeders Ltd, says to date it has worked diligently to ensure the best response to the disaster and spent more than $130m (£96m) to remove the wreck and debris at sea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says it has also paid more than $20m to the Sri Lankan government for clean-up operations on the coast and to compensate fishermen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says, however, that the Sri Lankan government has assumed responsibility for all shoreside clean-up activities and it is disappointed by the delays in that process and the ongoing impacts this is having.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Sri Lankan government says the amount paid by the ship's owner - which was capped by an interim UK maritime court order - is not enough to cover the long-term damage, and it is pursuing legal action to overturn the cap and secure further compensation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Thursday, Sri Lanka's Supreme Court ordered the company to pay $1bn as an initial payment to cover long-term economic and environmental damage it says the country suffered as a result of the disaster - but the cap remains in place. The Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction over Singapore, where X-Press Feeders Ltd has its headquarters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">X-Press Feeders said it was extremely disappointed with the judgment and that they are reviewing it with their legal advisers, insurers and other relevant stakeholders to best assess their next course of action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Professor Prasanthi Gunawardena - an environmental economist at University of Sri Jayawardenapura who chaired an expert committee of scientists to assess the damage - puts the cost of the disaster at closer to more than $6bn, taking into account things like the loss of wildlife, as well as impact on tourism, fishing and harm to local residents from the toxic cloud released when the ship burned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Large quantities of dioxin and furan have been added to the atmosphere and these are carcinogens. And then we have calculated it may kill about 70 people in our country,\" says Prof Gunawardena.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship owner rejects this assessment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It quotes the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation (ITOPF), an organisation which is funded by the shipping industry to assess marine spills. It says the report was \"unparticularised, inaccurate, and lacked credible scientific basis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ship owner has also said itself and its crew have \"followed the internationally accepted procedures in dealing with the acid leak, while maintaining all safety and emergency protocols\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Colombo Port Authority has also denied any responsibility, saying it did not know of the issues until the ship arrived in its waters.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Jude Sulanta says many local fishermen are now selling their boats and trying to go abroad</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The sea is the lifeblood of this island nation. Its stunning golden coasts are a huge draw for tourists, and for generations fishing has fed the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr Sulanta, the fisherman, is worried that his way of life no longer has a future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Many are selling their boats and trying to go abroad.

He wants to get the glory to boost his own political standing, and to secure minerals that are in America's interests,\" Prof De Waal said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, he noted that \"in DR Congo, China has already snapped up many of the minerals so the US is playing catch-up\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said that up to now US companies had been cautious about investing in DR Congo because of safety concerns and the \"moral hazard\" of dealing in so-called \"blood minerals\" - minerals financing rebellions - but this could change as the Trump administration implemented its peace model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof De Waal said this could also happen in other conflict-hit states like Sudan, where the Trump administration - along with Arab nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt - was expected to get involved in mediation efforts after previous initiatives failed.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that the Trump administration's peace model could not be dismissed out of hand, especially if it stops fighting that has killed thousands of people and displaced millions of others in conflicts that have raged for more than 30 years in eastern DR Congo. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump can get the different sides to talk, and shake things up,\" Prof De Waal said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Prof Hanri Mostert, an academic on mineral law at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, told the BBC that DR Congo \"risked compromising sovereignty over its minerals\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo could find itself locked into deals for years, in exchange for vague guarantees of security, she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was reminiscent of the \"resource-bartering\" deals pursued by China and Russia in numerous African states, Prof Mostert added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She cited as an example Angola, where China built infrastructure in exchange for oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Even when oil prices went up, Angola couldn't get more value for it,\" Prof Mostert said. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5816/live/aa090480-6877-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Three Chinese railway workers, two of whom are sitting and one of whom is walking, prepare to put tracks on 31 March2007 in Dondo in Angola\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">China has improved the rail network in Angola in exchange for access to the country's oil</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US State Department said in 2023 that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://2021-2025.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-democratic-republic-of-the-congo/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">DR Congo had an estimated $25trn (£21.2trn) in mineral reserves</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This included cobalt, copper, lithium, manganese and tantalum - needed to make the electronic components used in computers, electric vehicles, mobile phones, wind turbines and military hardware.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For how long will DR Congo have to give its cobalt to US investors? Will it be 20 years or 50 years? What is the price for peace?\" Prof Mostert asked. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo government spokesman Patrick Muyaya confirmed to the BBC's Newsday programme in March that his country wanted to supply the US with \"some critical minerals\" in exchange for a security deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The M23 rebel group launched a major offensive early this year, seizing huge areas of eastern DR Congo and smuggling minerals across the border to Rwanda,  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://docs.un.org/en/s/2025/446\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">UN experts said in a report earlier this month</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minerals were then mixed with Rwandan production, and \"their subsequent export to downstream actors reached unprecedented levels\", the UN experts added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rwanda denies accusations that it backs the M23, even though the UN has provided evidence it has thousands of soldiers in DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In what appears to be an attempt to address the issue of mineral smuggling, the US-brokered peace deal between DR Congo and Rwanda provides for a still-to-be negotiated \"regional economic integration framework\" between the two rival states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This would \"ensure illicit economic pathways are blocked\" and \"mutually beneficial partnerships and investment opportunities\" created for \"greater prosperity - especially for the region's population\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We're getting, for the United States, a lot of the mineral rights from the Congo as part of it,\" Trump said, ahead of the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.state.gov/peace-agreement-between-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-and-the-republic-of-rwanda/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">peace deal signed by representatives of the two governments on 27 June in Washington</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A DR Congo researcher with the South Africa-based Institute for Security Studies think-tank, Bram Verelst, told the BBC that the US initiative was running in tandem with another one being led by Qatar, a close US ally. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Verelst said the US's focus was mainly on the regional dimension, while Qatar's was on domestic issues between DR Congo's government and the M23 rebel group that has set up its own administration in the east after capturing the regional capital, Goma. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The BBC's Paul Njie reports from inside rebel-held Goma</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist who specialises in the region, told the BBC that Qatar, like other oil-rich Gulf states, was expanding into Africa \"to project power, influence, but also to seek economic opportunities\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that it became involved in mediation efforts at the request of Rwanda, which perceived the US as being in favour of DR Congo, something Washington denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Stearns said Qatar had \"massive\" economic interests in Rwanda, pointing out that the Gulf state was building a new multi-billion dollar airport in Kigali and was in talks to acquire a 49% stake in the national airline. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explained that the US and Qatar were working closely together, but it was less than ideal to have two processes because \"you don't want to end up in a situation where there is a peace deal between DR Congo and Rwanda, but Rwanda then says: 'We don't control the M23', and the M23 continues escalating [the conflict] in eastern DR Congo\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So it's very important that the two processes are tightly tied to each other since the actors are so closely linked,\" Prof Stearns added.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Under the peace deal, DR Congo and Rwanda agreed to launch a \"security co-ordination mechanism\" within 30 days of the 27 June deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Verelst said that a ceasefire was expected to take effect on Tuesday, followed by the DR Congo government and the M23 signing a comprehensive peace agreement by 18 August, building on the \"declaration of principles\" they had already negotiated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">DR Congo-based International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank analyst Onesphore Sematumba said the US and Qatar were getting deals struck in \"record time\" since Trump's rise to the US presidency in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Sematumba said their intervention came after various Africa-led mediation efforts had \"failed to get the parties to sign even a single document\" since 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Regional players do not have the same leverage to influence Kigali and Kinshasa,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But between the signing of an agreement and the achievement of peace, the road can be long, and it will be long in this case,\" Mr Sematumba warned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One key question is whether the M23 will give up the territory under its control, as demanded by Tshisekedi's government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Sematumba said the M23 had agreed to \"state authority\" being established across DR Congo, however, the rebels have also said they would not give up a \"single centimetre\" of land.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Personally, I think the transition should be gradual, and for certain areas there should be some kind of co-management. But everything will depend on the tact of the mediators, and their ability to break the ice,\" Mr Sematumba added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said the success of the peace initiative also hinged on what the agreement called the \"lifting of defensive measures\" by Rwanda, widely interpreted to mean the withdrawal of its troops from eastern DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Rwanda denies backing the M23, it says it wants to wipe out the FDLR, a militia born from those who carried out the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and then fled into DR Congo. Rwanda has accused the Congolese army of working with the FDLR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The peace deal spells out that the FDLR should be \"neutralised\", however this has been attempted several times over the past three decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For Rwanda, the neutralisation of the FDLR is a precondition for the withdrawal of its forces, while DR Congo says the two must be achieved simultaneously,\" Mr Sematumba pointed out, saying that mediators would have to find a solution as these issues had led to the failure of previous peace initiatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Just by following the different interpretations given by the parties to the texts signed, you can sense all the difficulties that lie ahead,\" Mr Sematumba said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Mostert agreed that diplomacy on its own could not achieve peace, and a broader initiative was needed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You build peace by transforming pain. That takes more than diplomacy. It takes dialogue, decentralised participation and dignifying people's experiences,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's why I believe it is important that the dealmakers and the lawmakers remain aware of historical traumas, including decades of resource exploitation,\" Prof Mostert added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So if he wants the peace to hold for long enough for US companies to profit, Donald Trump may have to keep the pressure on for some time to come.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 gMiqnK bPmazG\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 jdmgui\">More BBC stories on DR Congo-Rwanda peace deal:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
