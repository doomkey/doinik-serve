Some cordoned-off areas were guarded by armed riot squad officers who had their faces covered, while a police patrol boat was visible off the coast of Bondi Beach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many Australians, this level of security is an unfamiliar sight. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A large crowd - many wearing kippas, the Jewish skullcap, or draped in Australian flags - gathered to listen to speeches after the observing the silence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bee balloons floated in the wind in honour of the youngest victim of the attack, Matilda, who was nicknamed \"Matilda Bee\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later in the ceremony, the crowd sang Waltzing Matilda, the song the 10-year-old was named after. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon after, the crowd chanted the name of another child - Chaya, a 14-year-old who put herself in the firing line to protect a stranger's children. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shot in the leg, she used crutches to take to the stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you guys get inspired by one thing, one thing on all this, be the light in that field of darkness,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The event ended with the lighting of the menorah - something the crowds gathered for Hannukah last week couldn't do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Sunday's memorial was not limited to Bondi Beach or the state of New South Wales. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a nation-wide gesture of \"light over darkness\", the windowsills of countless homes across Australia were lined with candles.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Moment Australian PM Anthony Albanese booed at Bondi memorial</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Albanese arrived for the ceremony, one person in the crowd shouted: \"Blood on your hands.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister looked startled at the hostility and his wife Jodie Haydon grasped his arm in support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least one member of the crowd was tackled by police after moving towards the prime minister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Jewish community in Australia has repeatedly said this attack was a shock but not a surprise after a rise in antisemitic attacks in Australia since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, and the subsequent military retaliation war launched by Israel in the Gaza Strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The overwhelming view is that more could and should have been done to prevent the Sydney attack from happening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese has acknowledged the criticism, saying: \"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More widely, Albanese has been accused by some of siding with the Palestinians over supporting Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The relationship worsened when he moved to recognise the state of Palestine earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused him - as well as the leaders of other countries that have recognised a Palestinian state - of rewarding Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the Bondi Beach attack last Sunday, Netanyahu said Albanese's government \"did nothing to stop the spread of antisemitism in Australia\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast to the reception for the Australian prime minister, Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales, was praised at the Sydney memorial service as an exemplary leader, partly for the speed with which he admitted government errors in the lead-up to the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also attended the funerals of several victims this week. Albanese was not invited to some.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are deeply sorry,\" Minns said at the event. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We grieve with you, and with humility, I acknowledge that the government's highest duty is to protect its citizens. And we did not do that one week ago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting had \"highlighted a deep vein of antisemitic hate in our community\", Minns said, adding: \"This must be confronted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, David Ossip, was hailed with loud cheers as he called for a \"Royal Commission which goes beyond New South Wales, to get to the bottom of how this catastrophe took place\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suspected gunman Naveed Akram, 24, has been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98nm1ry38jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">charged with 59 offences</a>, including 15 counts of murder and one of committing a terrorist act. His father Sajid was killed during the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days after the attack, Albanese announced a raft of measures to crack down on hate speech and incitement to violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly before Sunday's ceremony, he announced a review into the police and national intelligence agencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,\" Albanese said, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also said he will reform gun laws and the government has launched a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn09p4kjj4wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">gun buyback scheme</a> - the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Five were women. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, according to Reprieve, most - around two thirds - were convicted of non-lethal drug-related offences, which the UN says is \"incompatible with international norms and standards\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than half of them were foreign nationals who appear to have been put to death as part of a \"war on drugs\" in the kingdom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Saudi authorities have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on the rise in executions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Saudi Arabia is operating with complete impunity now,\" said Jeed Basyouni, Reprieve's head of death penalty for the Middle East and North Africa. \"It's almost making a mockery of the human rights system.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She described torture and forced confessions as \"endemic\" within the Saudi criminal justice system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Basyouni called it a \"brutal and arbitrary crackdown\" in which innocent people and those on the margins of society have been caught up.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday saw the execution of  a young Egyptian fisherman, Issam al-Shazly, who was arrested in 2021 in Saudi territorial waters and said he had been coerced into smuggling drugs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reprieve says that 96 of the executions were solely linked to hashish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It almost seems that it doesn't matter to them who they execute, as long as they send a message to society that there's a zero-tolerance policy on whatever issue they're talking about -

But only some have been released, many with numerous redactions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawmakers who pushed for these documents to see the light of day have described the DOJ's efforts as insincere, and some legal experts say that the redactions may only fuel ongoing conspiracy theories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We just want all of the evidence of these crimes out there,\" Epstein survivor Liz Stein told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Stein told Radio 4's Today programme that she thought the justice department was \"really brazenly going against the Epstein Files Transparency Act\" - the law that requires all the documents to be released.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Survivors are really worried about the possibility of a \"slow roll-out of incomplete information without any context\", she noted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marina Lacerda, who was 14 when she was abused by Epstein, also told the BBC some of the survivors were \"still nervous and sceptical about how they are going to release the rest of the files\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are very worried that it will still be redacted in the same way that it was today. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are a little disappointed that they're now still lingering on and distracting us with other things.\" </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afe5/live/b53397d0-dd43-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.png.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Justice Epstein poses with Michael Jackson \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Justice</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Epstein poses with Michael Jackson </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the latest released information is a photo of Epstein now jailed confidante Ghislaine Maxwell outside Downing Street - the UK prime minister's office and residence - a document that claims Epstein introduced a 14-year-old girl to US President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, and multiple images of former President Bill Clinton.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other released photos show the interiors of Epstein's homes, his overseas travels, as well as celebrities, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Peter Mandelson - former UK Labour Party politician and ambassador to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being named or pictured in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing. Many of those identified in the files or in previous releases related to Epstein have denied any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims. Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing by survivors of Epstein's abuse, and has denied knowledge of his sex offending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 15 of the released files were no longer available on the DOJ website on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a desk, according to CBS, the BBC's media partner in the US. The photos showed Bill Clinton, and another was of the Pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of Trump, Epstein, and Maxwell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not clear why the files were no longer available. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X on Saturday night, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the DOJ for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Friday - the day the materials were released - that the department had identified more than 1,200 Epstein victims or their relatives, and withheld material that could identify them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many of the documents are also heavily redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DOJ said it would comply with the congressional request to release documents, with some stipulations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It redacted personally identifiable information about Epstein's victims, materials depicting child sexual abuse, materials depicting physical abuse, any records that \"would jeopardise an active federal investigation\" or any classified documents that must stay secret to protect \"national defence or foreign policy\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DOJ said it was \"not redacting the names of any politicians\", and added a quote they attributed to Blanche, saying: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law - full stop. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">John Day, a criminal defence attorney, told the BBC he was surprised by the amount of information that was redacted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is just going to feed the fire if you are a conspiracy theorist,\" he said. \"I don't think anyone anticipated there would be this many redactions. It certainly raises questions about how faithfully the DOJ is following the law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Day also noted that the justice department is required to provide a log of what was being redacted to Congress within 15 days of the files' release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Until you know what's being redacted you don't know what's being withheld,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter to the judges overseeing the Epstein and Maxwell cases, US attorney for the Southern District of New York Jay Clayton, said: \"Victim privacy interests counsel in favour of redacting the faces of women in photographs with Epstein even where not all the women are known to be victims because it is not practicable for the department to identify every person in a photo.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clayton added that \"this approach to photographs could be viewed by some as an over-redaction\" - but that \"the department believes it should, in the compressed time frame, err on the side of redacting to protect victims.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e455/live/748d5920-ddcd-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Liz Stein, who was a victim of late financier Jeffrey Epstein, speaks on the day of a rally in support of Epstein's victims, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, in September 2025.

Putin said it would not lead to the result that Kyiv wanted and would not disrupt Russian exports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the questions from Russian media or from the public made little attempt to challenge Putin, but two were allowed from Western correspondents, Keir Simmons of US network NBC and the BBC's Steve Rosenberg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Simmons asked if Putin would feel responsible for the deaths of Ukrainians and Russians if he rejected the Trump peace plan, Putin praised the US president's \"sincere\" efforts to end the war, but said it was the West not Russia that was blocking a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The ball is in the hands of our Western opponents,\" he said, \"primarily the leaders of the Kyiv regime, and in this case, first and foremost, their European sponsors.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said a peace deal is closer than ever and, despite Putin's apparent refusal to compromise, the US president has said he hopes \"Ukraine moves quickly because Russia is there\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Ukrainian delegation is holding talks in Miami on Friday with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. German, French and British officials are also there, days after they met the US officials in Berlin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev is also expected in Miami over the weekend, according to reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin told the BBC's Russia Editor: \"We are ready to work with you - with the UK and with Europe in general and with the United States, but as equals, with mutual respect to each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to cease these hostilities immediately, provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to cooperate with you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the West of creating an enemy out of Russia. Skating over his decision to mount a full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said: \"You are waging a war against us with the hands of Ukrainian neo-Nazis,\" before repeating his regular diatribe against Ukraine's democratically elected leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European intelligence agencies have warned that Russia is only a few years away from attacking Nato. The Western defensive alliance's chief Mark Rutte said this month that Russia was already escalating a covert campaign and the West had to be prepared for war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many of the questions were benign, including several from children, from a one reporter from Yakutia in north-eastern Siberia highlighted a tenfold increase in energy prices in the past four years. Putin told her that his team would look into alternative sources of energy and \"keep Yakutia in mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Towards the end of the TV marathon, Putin was asked a series of quickfire questions, touching on his views on friendship, religion, the motherland and love at first sight. He said he believed in love at first sight - then added that he himself was in love, without divulging any more details.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp844kjj37vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Lai was found guilty on all counts</a> of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\".

He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995.

He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters.

To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then in 1989, Beijing <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48445934\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square</a>: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then.

He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed.

From this temporary refuge, it seems he was then able to travel on to a more secure offer of asylum elsewhere - probably in the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou, or Niamey in Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opacity surrounding Togo's rumoured role in this affair is typical of a country that, under the leadership of Faure Gnassingbé, knows how to extract the maximum diplomatic leverage by defying convention and cultivating relations with a variety of often competing international partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lomé regime is far too shrewd to be caught out openly supporting a challenge to Benin's President Patrice Talon – with whom its relations are guarded at best – or officially confirming the Béninois belief that it secured coup-leader Tigri's passage to safety. Both governments are members of the beleaguered Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Gnassingbé makes no secret of cultivating affable and supportive relations with Burkina Faso and the fellow Sahelian military governments in Niger and Mali – all three of whom walked out of Ecowas last January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor is he afraid of reminding France, Togo's traditional main international partner, that he has other options.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 30 October President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Gnassingbé to the Élysée Palace for talks aimed at strengthening bilateral relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But less than three weeks later, the Togolese leader was in Moscow for a notably warm encounter with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They formally approved a defence partnership allowing Russian vessels to use Lomé port, one of the best-equipped deepwater harbours on the western coast of Africa and a key supply gateway for the landlocked Sahelian states that, following the military coups of 2020 to 2023, have become key Kremlin protégés.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Gnassingbé's trip to Paris was fairly low-key, his Moscow excursion was high-profile and wide-ranging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bilateral military accord provides for intelligence and joint military exercises (although Lomé has no plans to provide a base for the Africa Corps, the Kremlin-controlled successor to the now disbanded Wagner mercenary outfit). All this was supplemented with plans for economic cooperation and an announcement of the reopening of their respective embassies, both closed back in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/61be/live/ff598670-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu via Getty Images Two women in matching wax fabrics.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Anadolu via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most people in Togo have only ever known life under the Gnassingbé family</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably all this has unsettled France, for whom Togo was once regarded as among the most devoted of allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lt Col Tigri launched his coup attempt in Benin, Macron was quick to show other Ecowas governments that it was France that could rapidly provide emergency specialist military support for their intervention to protect constitutional order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Togolese insist that their move to strengthen ties with Russia is not a conscious move to break ties with the West. Instead, Lomé presents the move as a natural diversification of relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there is some coherence to this argument.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three years ago Togo and Gabon opted to complement their longstanding participation in the grouping of French-speaking countries, the International Francophonie Organisation (IOF), with membership of the Commonwealth too. Meanwhile, last year English-speaking Ghana, a Commonwealth stalwart, joined the Francophonie.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, these days many West African governments become exasperated with the outside world's tendency to view such connections as a choice between a new Cold War alignment or taking sides in a parochial anglophone-francophone competition between former colonial powers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say they want to be friends with a wide range of international partners and see no reason why such relationships should be exclusive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Togo's premier, perhaps more than any other leader in West Africa, has sought to extend this diversified approach to his regional dealings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lomé is a major freight and travel hub whose port can accommodate the largest ocean-going container ships, with feeder vessels distributing transhipped cargo to a range of other smaller or shallower ports that could not do so. From Lomé's airport, local flights fan out across western and central Africa. The city is also home to banks and other regional financial entities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These connections have helped to diversify the economic foundations of a country whose rural areas remain relatively poor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/533c/live/f6e70850-dcdb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images King Charles III shakes hands during an audience with the President of the Togolese Republic Faure Gnassingbé at Buckingham Palace.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">French-speaking Togo recently joined the Commonwealth - a club of mainly former British colonies</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Togo needs to remain at the heart of the Ecowas regional grouping and, in fact, sits astride the key Lagos-Abidjan transport corridor, a major development priority for the bloc. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Gnassingbé has concluded that he also needs to maintain strong relations with the breakaway military-run regimes, now grouped in their own Alliance of Sahelian States (AES) – which Togo's Foreign Minister, Prof Robert Dussey has even speculated about joining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this is about more than economic or diplomatic diversification. It also connects to Gnassingbé's domestic political strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A constitutional change announced in 2024 and implemented this year transformed the presidency – which carries a term limit – into a purely ceremonial role and shifted all executive authority into the post of prime minister, now dubbed \"president of the council\" in a borrowing of Spanish and Italian terminology.  <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgjl9l9z7zjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">This latter post is subject to no term limit</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That allowed Gnassingbé to hand over the presidency to a low-profile regime stalwart and take on the new strong premier role, with little prospect of an end limit on his rule, given the longstanding dominance of his political party, Union for the Republic (UNIR) in successive parliamentary elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was hugely controversial.

and does not need to cede to Europe, or anyone else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Togo has a history of sudden eruptions of protest or unrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And despite his bullish tone, the new \"president of the council\" may quietly have concluded that it would be wise to afford a gesture of magnanimity, to salve the resentments that still bubble under the surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a state of the nation address earlier this month, he said he would instruct the justice minister to look at possible prisoner releases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This hint of retreat from the earlier crackdown shows that even Gnassingbé's nimble international networking cannot defuse the underlying political discontent at home.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

It said the allegations had \"gravely intensified\" after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other reports by Israeli and Palestinian rights groups have detailed what they say is \"systematic\" abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has denied all the allegations, but rights groups say the fury in the country over the 7 October attacks and the treatment of Israeli hostages in Gaza has created a culture of impunity within the prison services, especially towards detainees who have expressed support for Hamas and its attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, leaked CCTV footage from inside an Israeli military prison showed a Palestinian man from Gaza allegedly being sexually abused by prison guards. That led to a resignation and recriminations at the top of Israel's military and political establishment.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sami al-Saei, 46, now works in a furniture shop, but he used to be a freelance journalist in the town of Tulkarm, in the north of the occupied West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was arrested by Israeli soldiers in January 2024 after working with reporters to arrange interviews with members of Hamas and other armed groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was detained without being charged for 16 months, under a controversial Israeli system known as administrative detention, before being released this summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While he was being held in Megiddo prison in northern Israel, he said, the guards partially stripped him and raped him with a baton on or around 13 March 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he had decided to speak to the BBC about his allegations of sexual abuse, despite the risk of being ostracised in the often conservative Palestinian society in the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There were five or six of them,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They were laughing and enjoying it. The guard asked me: 'Are you enjoying this? We want to play with you, and bring your wife, your sister, your mother, and friends here too,'\" Mr al-Saei continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was hoping to die and be done from that, as the pain was not only caused by the rape, but also from the severe and painful beating.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the assault lasted around 15 to 20 minutes, during which time the guards also squeezed his genitals, causing extreme pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the beatings happened on an almost daily basis, but he was only sexually abused once.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked the Israel Prison Service (IPS) for a response to Mr al-Saei's allegations. It sent a statement, which said: \"We operate in full accordance with the law, while ensuring the safety, welfare, and rights of all inmates under its custody.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are not aware of the claims described, and to the best of our knowledge, no such incidents have occurred under IPS responsibility.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We also asked the IPS whether an investigation had been launched into the alleged sexual assault and whether any medical records existed.

The assault allegedly happened in July 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five Israeli reservist soldiers were charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm to the detainee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, they convened a press conference on Israeli television, four of them appearing in black balaclavas to hide their identities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with Channel 14 News, a fifth soldier pulled off his mask to reveal his face, saying he had nothing to hide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All five have denied the charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reservists held the press conference after it emerged that the CCTV footage was leaked by the Israeli military's top lawyer, Military Advocate General Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She resigned in October, saying that she took full responsibility for the leak. She explained that she had wanted to \"counter false propaganda against the army's law enforcement authorities\" – a reference to claims from some right-wing politicians that the allegations were fabricated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Supporters of the far right have held protests in support of the five accused reservists outside Sde Teiman prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, before her resignation, at a fiery committee hearing at Israel's parliament, Hanoch Milwidsky, a politician from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, was challenged over whether raping a detainee was acceptable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Shut up, shut up,\" he shouted. \"Yes, everything is legitimate if they are Nukhba [elite Hamas fighters who took part in the 7 October attacks]. Everything.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent opinion poll by the widely respected Israel Democracy Institute indicated that the majority of the Israeli public oppose investigating soldiers when they are suspected of having abused Palestinians from Gaza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"Ahmed\" alleges he was abused in an Israeli prison after being found guilty of incitement to terrorism</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahmed, not his real name, lives in the West Bank with his wife and 11 children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was arrested by soldiers in January 2024 and was found guilty of incitement to terrorism, after making social media posts praising the 7 October Hamas-led attacks, in which around 1,200 people, mostly Israelis, were killed and a further 251 were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sentenced to one year in prison and fined 3,000 shekels ($935, £700).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He alleges serious sexual abuse while in Israeli detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The prison guards, three of them, took me into a bathroom and stripped me completely naked before forcing me to the ground,\" Ahmed said in an interview at his home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They put my head in the toilet bowl and a massive man, maybe 150kg (330lb), stood on my head, so I was bent over. Then, I heard the voice of someone talking to the prison dog. The dog was named Messi, like the footballer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then detailed how he said the dog was used to sexually humiliate him. He said his trousers and underwear were removed and the dog mounted his back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I could feel its breath... then it jumped on me... I started to scream.

Right?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what's it like putting a question to Vladimir Putin - the president who ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the leader whose country was accused this week by the head of MI6 of \"the export of chaos\"?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And imagine asking that question live on TV while millions of Russians are watching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a big responsibility. You don't want to mess up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My question is about Russia's future. What kind of future are you planning for your country and your people?\" I ask President Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Will the future be like the present, with any public objection to the official line punishable by law?  Will the hunt for enemies at home and abroad be accelerated? Will mobile internet outages become even more common? Will there be new 'special military operations'?\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While I'm speaking, Vladimir Putin is making notes. And then replies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He defends Russia's repressive foreign agent law. Hundreds of Russians who are critical of the authorities have been designated \"foreign agents\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We didn't invent it,\" Putin tells me. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This [foreign agent] law was adopted in a string of Western countries, including in America in the 1930s. And all these laws, including the US one, are much tougher…\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In reality, the Russian law is draconian. It excludes \"foreign agents\" from many aspects of public life, including teaching, the civil service, elections and public events. It imposes financial and property restrictions. Criminal prosecution can follow a single administrative fine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, I'm unable to point this out to President Putin. The microphone was taken away from me after I'd finished my question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suddenly the moderator intervenes to change the subject.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's another question here: 'What's going to happen to the BBC? It's facing a multi-billion lawsuit from the US president?',\" says anchor Pavel Zarubin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think President Trump is right,\" President Putin confirms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin and the White House seeing eye to eye… on the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin returns to my question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Will there be new special military operations? There won't be, if you treat us with respect, and respect our interests, just as we've always tried to do with you. Unless you cheat us, like you did with Nato's eastward expansion.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Visible for all to see is what is driving Vladimir Putin - a deep-seated resentment of the West. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues that, for years, Western leaders have disrespected, deceived and lied to Russia - and that they're lying still by claiming that Moscow intends to attack Europe. \"What kind of rubbish is that?\" declares the Kremlin leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many European leaders simply don't trust Moscow. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the run-up to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian officials denied they had plans for a mass attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently Russia has been accused of violating European air space with fighter jets and drones, as well as of carrying out cyber-attacks and acts of sabotage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as he finished answering my question, was this an olive branch to Europe from Russia's president?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're ready to cease hostilities immediately provided that Russia's medium- and long-term security is ensured, and we are ready to co-operate with you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, if Moscow continues to connect its long-term security to its maximalist demands over Ukraine, European leaders will remain sceptical.</p></div></div></body></html>"

His mother and sister are outspoken feminists who had tried to \"inject him\" with their ideology, he told local media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Park says he began to question his family's politics in the #MeToo era, and was soon exposed to right-wing views online. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For him, the American right is an inspiration.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af3a/live/56786b00-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Hosu Lee A man with black hair and wearing a black speaks into a microphone\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Hosu Lee</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Park Joon-young, 24, is the leader of the Freedom University movement</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was often called extreme right and it is very easy to get cancelled in Korea.

Charlie Kirk and Maga confidently delivered their message and spoke up,\" he says. \"We are trying to build the same type of platform where people can debate without fear.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has rejected allegations that he and his movement are \"far right\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC that the most effective message for his group is the simplest one: \"Korea is for Koreans.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is accompanied by a series of claims against Chinese immigrants - the most popular of which are unproven and disputed allegations of them stuffing ballots and attacking Koreans. The government has strongly refuted these. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group also portrays <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7eyg0808xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to thaw ties between Seoul and Beijing</a> as proof that the current government is subservient to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Park says he mostly uses social media platforms popular with young people to spread his message. He started with EveryTime, a Korean online forum exclusive to university students, but has since moved his focus to making short-form videos which have gone viral on Instagram, Threads, and YouTube.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group then gained notoriety in September when it marched through Seoul's Myeongdong neighbourhood, which is frequented by Chinese tourists and home to the Chinese embassy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their videos, where protesters chant anti-Chinese slurs, have gone viral enough that Lee has declared that disinformation and hate speech has reached a dangerous level, and directed his government to criminalise them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Freedom University's message has proved effective in a country where Sinophobia is widespread and the population regularly ranks as one of the world's least favourable towards China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also resonated deeply with Korean youth, many of whom are disenchanted with the state of the economy and their future prospects. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disenchanted youth</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest national survey suggests young South Koreans are the most pessimistic about their country's future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 75% of them believe the economy is in poor shape, compared to their parents. Around 50% of that generation hold a positive view of the economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's economy has grown only 1 to 2% since the pandemic - and with Trump's trade war and growing Chinese competition, young South Koreans are feeling the squeeze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home ownership rates for younger generations are at an all-time low. And despite South Korea's education level being one of the highest in the world, the median monthly income sits around $1,600 per month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Youth psychiatrist and author Kim Hyun Soo says many of these youths hold a deep grudge against Lee's Democratic Party, which has dominated politics for the past decade yet failed to deliver on its economic promises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Lee's party] had completely failed its housing policy,\" Mr Kim says. \"Their largest grievances are really the lack of housing and employment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The economic pinch, mixed with thriving reactionary online culture and tense gender dynamics, creates a fertile soil for groups like Park's to recruit from.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are also the least critical of Yoon's martial law move - only half of those under 30 believe he is guilty of insurrection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The policies put forth by this government, they are absurd. They are not good for the youth.

And Zamrock was that sound - that sound of new freedom, that sound of boldness,\" the Zambian-born, Botswanan-raised rapper - who has performed at the likes of Glastonbury, Coachella and the Sydney Opera House - told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock - with its heady blend of psychedelic rock and traditional Zambian sounds - rears its head on Can't Hold Us, the first single to be released from Sampa's upcoming album. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fuzz guitars thrust the song forwards, as 32-year-old Sampa, full name Sampa Tembo, defiantly raps: \"They don't have the guts to match my prowess.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And she's not the only contemporary artist who has been digging through Zamrock's dusty crates. In the past few years US hitmakers Travis Scott, Yves Tumour and Tyler, the Creator have sampled tracks from Ngozi Family, Amanaz and WITCH - all popular bands in Zamrock's 1970s heyday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock can also be heard on our screens - HBO superhero series Watchmen and Emmy-winner Ted Lasso have incorporated songs from the genre in their soundtracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is an unexpected resurgence, especially given that in its heyday, Zamrock never really left the African continent. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sampa the Great thinks Zamrock's resurgence will be \"huge\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The movement emerged in the 1970s, in a Zambia recently broken free from its British colonisers. The nation was basking in an economic boom and President Kenneth Kaunda had enforced a \"Zambia first\" policy which, among many other things, meant 95% of the music played by radio stations had to be of Zambian origin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The groundwork was laid for young creatives to forge a bold, distinctly Zambian musical identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were influenced by rock bands like Deep Purple, Grand Funk Railroad, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown,\" says WITCH frontman Emmanuel Chanda, better known as Jagari, after Mick Jagger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we were Africans. We wanted to play like those rock bands but then the African aspect was also calling: 'You can't leave me behind'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 1970s, Zambia's recording studios were rudimentary and there was no established recording industry. Regardless, Zamrock thrived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musicians illuminated stages with bell-bottom jeans, platform shoes and colourful headbands. WITCH, an acronym for We Intend To Cause Havoc, lived up to their name, with fans clamouring outside sold-out venues, hoping to watch marathon shows that sometimes lasted from 19:00 to 02:00.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The fact that they mixed traditional music with psychedelic rock in a conservative country... and to be able to do that and be loud about it - it was something very bold to do in the 70s, let alone now,\" says Sampa - who was pleased to recently discover that her uncle, \"Groovy\" George Kunda, was a founding member of WITCH.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for all of its impact, Zamrock could not last. The genre crumbled after roughly a decade, when Zambia was hit with a series of crises. The price of copper, Zambia's main export, plummeted, leading to an economic decline that diminished the ability to tour, record and buy music. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musical piracy also hit Zamrockers, as bootleggers made money by copying and selling their music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And from the 1980s, the country was badly hit by the HIV/Aids crisis, which led to the deaths of many musicians. Five of WITCH's founding members died from Aids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zamrock lay dormant for decades. Its surviving founders returned to civilian life - Jagari went to work in the mines to support his family.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6001/live/1b001d20-db34-11f0-9997-ed89cd5d199e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage via Getty Images Tyler, the Creator poses wearing a furry hat, blue blazer, yellow shirt and gold chain.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tyler, the Creator had high praise for Zamrock's Ngozi Family, who he sampled in his 2024 single Noid</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the early 2010s, seemingly out of nowhere, record collectors in the West caught on to the genre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US-based label Now-Again Records played a significant part in Zamrock's revival, sourcing and reissuing albums from some of the genre's biggest names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wasn't sure if it had a market.

The ensuing buzz led to a reincarnation of the band, featuring Jageri and Patrick Mwondela from WITCH's old days, and a number of younger European musicians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">WITCH have since released two albums, starred in a documentary, played at the iconic Glastonbury Festival and toured outside Africa - something the original band never managed to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like a new lease on life I never expected at my advanced age,\" 74-year-old Jagari says on a call from New Zealand, the final stop on WITCH's 2025 world tour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Munich, there was crowd surfing, which I had never done before.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Jagari is thrilled by a second chance to play Zamrock, new opportunities are a reminder of his sorely missed bandmates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are times that I wish the whole band, the original line-up, was there to showcase what it was like in the beginning,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The crowds at WITCH's shows, comprising fans young and old, are proof of Zamrock's fresh appeal.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8eac/live/bd105220-da8e-11f0-9f97-57c07d0b6eae.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Redferns/Getty Images Emmanuel 'Jagari' Chanda sings into a microphone on stage, wearing a colourful outfit and hat\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Redferns/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jagari and the new version of WITCH played Glastonbury earlier this year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Zamrockers are also being rediscovered - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/vHmg-xaNJX0?si=U7K4YCzNswrYUM4h&amp;t=704\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tyler</a>,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://youtu.be/vHmg-xaNJX0?si=U7K4YCzNswrYUM4h&amp;t=704\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> the Creator, who sampled the Ngozi Family song 45,000 Volts on his 2024 track Noid, called the band \"incredible\"</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The whole country was just doing some, really, really good stuff,\" he told popular interviewer Nardwuar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Go-to hip-hop producer Madlib and Mike D of the Beastie Boys have also voiced admiration for the genre, while Third Man Records, the label co-owned by blues-rocker Jack White, has released a recording of live WITCH music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Egon believes Zamrock's surprise popularity is down to its exuberance.

His cooks minced the meat with papaya, saffron and spices and made it so fine and silky that it needed no chewing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But perhaps the biggest contribution of the cooks of Awadh was the slow-cook Dum pukht technique where food is cooked on a low, slow heat, with the pot's lid tightly sealed with dough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was popularised during the 18th Century reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah - the region was in the grip of a famine and he initiated a work-for-food programme. Large cauldrons with rice, vegetables, meat and spices were sealed to make a one-dish meal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The story goes that the Nawab caught a whiff of the aromas emanating from the pots, demanded a taste and the Dum technique was officially adopted in his kitchens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This technique was revived and commercially popularised in modern India by the late chef Imtiaz Qureshi, recognised as an Awadhi cuisine maestro and the force behind present-day iconic Delhi restaurants Bukhara and Dum Pukht, which are included in <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theworlds50best.com/discovery/Establishments/India/New-Delhi/Dum-Pukht.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Asia's 50 Best Restaurants list</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides the obvious kebabs and biryani, the cooks also built up a repertoire of dishes that included kormas (curries), sheermal (saffron flat bread) and shahi tukda (bread pudding).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lucknow is not just about kebabs and biryani - the region is also a vegetarian's paradise.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69bb/live/b107c060-dbee-11f0-8af2-2d39028f98bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Maroof Culmen A man's hand holds a plate of dessert in Lucknow\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Maroof Culmen</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The city offers unique seasonal delights, such as Makkhan Malai, a unique cloud-like dessert, in the winter</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local Baniya community's traditionally strictly vegetarian cuisine not only celebrates seasonal produce but also gives the city its highly curated Indian desserts and sweets and unique street food, like chaat - spicy, tangy fried snacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost at every corner, there are little shops and kiosks, the little-known hidden gems that are popular with the locals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the city centre of Hazratganj, huge crowds start milling around from 5am at Sharmaji Tea Stall to get a steaming cup of milky masala chai, served in clay glasses, along with pillowy soft buns lathered with hand-churned white butter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Morning walkers, political strategists and journalists gather around this nondescript shabby shack, which has been operating since 1949 and is now a legacy tourist attraction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For breakfast, one can head to Netram - a no-frills joint operating in the old city area of Aminabad.

The process of making it is scientific and complicated. The cook hand-churns the milk and then leaves it out at night, exposed to the dew that gives it its incredible frothy texture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On cold mornings, street vendors can be seen lined up in old city areas like Aminabad and Chowk. Many, however, say that their children do not want to learn the art.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chef Brar, who is also from Lucknow and has been an unequivocal advocate for its food, has often said that the city's rich food legacy places it right on top of the pile of the Indian street food experience. But the real value from the Unesco recognition, he says, will occur only if Lucknow can now create awareness about its lesser-known eateries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Kukreja says every dish in Lucknow tells a story - shaped by generational food businesses, from humble street carts to bustling restaurants, and guarded family recipes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The international acclaim, she hopes, will encourage more people around the world to learn these stories and visit the city to savour the culinary delights of Lucknow.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
