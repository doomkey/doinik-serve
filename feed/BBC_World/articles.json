It attributed the power losses to missile and drone strikes on energy infrastructure in the city and several other regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones were launched on targets across Ukraine into Saturday, officials said, killing three and injuring dozens of others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has intensified attacks on Ukrainian civilian and energy infrastructure as the embattled nation heads into winter, despite US-led efforts to secure a peace deal.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's defence ministry said it had launched \"a massive strike... against Ukrainian military-industrial complex enterprises and the energy facilities that support their operation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as energy infrastructure, several residential buildings were hit in the overnight strikes, Ukrainian officials said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Loud explosions were heard across Kyiv early on Saturday morning. Emergency services were later seen attending to burning blocks of flats damaged by successful strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko said a 13-year-old child was among the 29 people injured in the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's Air Force said it shot down 558 of the drones and 19 of the missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian capital is among several cities that have suffered regular aerial bombardment since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Ukrainians have also had to live through regular blackouts, as Moscow has targeted energy infrastructure in previous winters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is forecast to fall to 2C in Kyiv on Sunday, which has average temperatures below freezing in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has targeted Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and depots, in particular with long-range weaponry that can probe deep inside Russia.

a branch of the Department of Homeland Security - has been told not to approve, deny or close asylum applications it receives for all nationalities, according CBS News, the BBC's US partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its officers can continue to work on asylum applications and review cases up to the point of making a decision, CBS reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But few details are known about Friday's directive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not name which countries might be affected by his migration pause, which could face legal challenges and has already prompted pushback from UN agencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president's recent announcements represent a further toughening of his stance towards migrants during his second presidency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also sought to enact mass deportations of illegal migrants, cut the annual number of refugee admissions, and to end automatic citizenship rights currently applicable to many born on US territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following Wednesday's fatal attack, the Trump administration temporarily stopped issuing visas to Afghans through the same programme the shooting suspect had, before suspending all immigration requests from Afghans pending a review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Thursday, the USCIS said it would re-examine green cards issued to individuals who had migrated to the US from 19 countries, without mentioning Wednesday's attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency referred to a June proclamation that included<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia and Venezuela.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Details on what re-examination would look like were not provided.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump then pledged to \"end all federal benefits and subsidies to non-citizens\" on Thursday. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Third-world countries'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump blamed refugees for causing the \"social dysfunction in America\" and vowed to remove \"anyone who is not a net asset\" to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia were completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The phrase \"third world\" is one previously used to describe poorer, developing nations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, a travel ban was imposed on nationals primarily from 11 African and Asian nations, including Afghanistan.

London's Gatwick Airport reported \"some disruption\", while Heathrow said it had not experienced any cancellations. Manchester Airport said it did not anticipate significant problems.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">British Airways and Air India are understood not to be heavily impacted by the issue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Air France appeared to be experiencing some disruption on Saturday morning with several flights in and out of Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport delayed or cancelled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile Easyjet said it was \"expecting this to result in some disruption\" but later added it had started and \"already completed the software update on many aircraft\" and was planning a full service on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US, the software issue emerged on the same weekend as Thanksgiving - one of the busiest travel periods of the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">American Airlines said 340 of its planes were affected and that it expected \"some operational delays\", but added the vast majority of updates would be completed on Friday or Saturday. Delta Airlines said it believed the impact on its operations would be \"limited\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Australia, budget airline Jetstar cancelled 90 flights after confirming around a third of its fleet was impacted, with disruption expected to continue all weekend despite the majority of aircraft having already undergone the update.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tim Johnson, policy director at the UK's Civil Aviation Authority, said the notice from Airbus \"unfortunately may mean there is some disruption, some delays or cancellations over the coming days\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that aviation was still \"one of the safest forms of transport\" due to the rigorous maintenance programs airlines have in place, and described the mass-grounding of flights as a \"a very rare event\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said \"the impact on UK airlines seems limited\", adding: \"It is heartening this issue has been identified and will be addressed so swiftly, demonstrating the high aviation safety standards globally.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The problem identified with A320 aircraft relates to a piece of computing software which calculates a plane's elevation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Airbus discovered that, at high altitudes, its data could be corrupted by intense radiation released periodically by the Sun. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That led to the October incident in which an aircraft suddenly lost altitude - though the manufacturer said this was the only time an incident of its kind had occurred. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) has issued an emergency airworthiness directive, ordering the problem be addressed before each plane can carry passengers again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They will be allowed to make so-called \"ferry flights\", without passengers, in order to reach a maintenance facility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The A320 family are what is known as \"fly by wire\" planes. This means there is no direct mechanical link between the controls in the cockpit and the parts of the aircraft that actually govern flight, with the pilot's actions processed by a computer.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Organisers say it's \"the largest authentic German Christmas market\" outside the country and Austria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets are thought to have originated in Germany in the 14th Century, and its markets have long been admired since. But how close are the ones in the UK to that supposed traditional, real thing?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News visited some to find out - and perhaps provide some inspiration for your next festive visit.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A taste of Germany... in Birmingham?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold Thursday afternoon in Birmingham, we have just met Nina Adler and Till Rampe, 27-year-old German students studying for PhDs in the UK's \"second city\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we walk around the Christmas market, which snakes through streets close to Birmingham New Street railway station, they're reminded of home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They point to the wooden huts, food and drink, and the handicrafts as positive signs this is close to the traditional ideal. The chocolate-coated marshmallows at one stall impress Till, who is from a town near Frankfurt. \"I could swear they are from my hometown,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The warm lights of the Christmas market have given Birmingham city centre a festive glow</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other aspects of Birmingham's market are further removed from the German way - like the beer. \"People are just connecting Germany with beer,\" Nina, from Berlin, says. \"In Germany usually you drink mulled wine. This is very typical.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as for the pop tunes blaring out of the speakers in Birmingham - like The Power of Love - you probably wouldn't hear that at markets in Germany - rather it would be Christmas music and carols, she says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nina Adler and Till Rampe were impressed by what they saw in Birmingham</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also visiting the market with us is Katharina Karcher, an academic at the University of Birmingham. Her verdict? It's \"super authentic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been set up in 1997 and running annually since 2001, the Birmingham market is organised by Kurt Stroscher, who is also director of Frankfurt's Christmas market. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He uses \"only wooden stalls and atmospheric white lights that don't blink\", with the stalls built in Germany and food and drink imported from there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's mostly a thumbs-up for Birmingham's Christmas market when it comes to authenticity, then - but how does it compare to one in Germany?</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Birmingham's market stretches through several streets</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Our visit to a Christmas market in Berlin</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many Christmas markets in the UK have been running for a couple of weeks now, in Germany they have only just opened, as is tradition, on 24 November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most German towns and cities have a Christmas market, with Dresden, Nuremberg and Cologne among the most famous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These markets hold \"huge symbolic meaning\" to Germans, says Dr Karcher, who's from near Frankfurt. Along with a religious undertone, \"they are what get people through the dark time\", she explains.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Berlin Christmas market: A typical Christmas market includes large tents housing restaurants or bars and stalls selling a range of handmade gifts</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some 800 miles away from Birmingham, the city of Berlin is home to more than 70 different, small Christmas markets. In Charlottenburg Palace in the west of the German capital, the market is bustling and filled with people of all ages when we visit on a Tuesday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The smell of roasted almonds, caramelised apples, chocolate-coated fruit, mulled wine and grilled sausages fills the air, as Christmas carols are performed live on a stage and children enjoy a small, sparkling Ferris wheel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 17th Century Baroque Charlottenburg Palace is illuminated in different colours, with falling snowflakes projected onto its facade and wooden stalls in front.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what exactly makes a traditional German Christmas market?</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Christmas market we visited in Berlin used projections as well as fairy lights</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Typically, they may have (as this one in Berlin does):</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Large tents housing entire restaurants or bars</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Stalls selling a range of handmade gifts, including woolly hats, gloves, scarves, jewellery, handmade candles, wooden nutcrackers and other arts and crafts</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Traditional German foods like Lebkuchen, the German version of gingerbread often seen in cookie form, many kinds of sausages including Bratwurst, cheeses, hearty dishes like Langos (a deep-fried Hungarian flatbread with different savoury or sweet toppings) or goulash, and Spätzle</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Mulled wine for those who drink alcohol, not so much beer</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">A location in a square in the Altstadt, the old part of a town. And in cities - lots of different markets in different areas</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To Magrita, 66, who is enjoying a mulled wine with her husband Dietmar, 69, German Christmas markets are characterised by their unique atmosphere: \"The colourful lights and Christmas decorations make it so special.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dietmar explains how \"Christmas markets are not the same as other markets labelled as 'Winter Market' or 'Winter Wonderland,' because of the fairytale-like feeling you only get at an authentic Christmas market\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I visited a Christmas market in Milan a few years ago, and it wasn't the same, it was just a collection of different stores,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another table, Anna and Karolina, both 19, are catching up over some chocolate-covered strawberries. \"Apart from the mulled wine and the food, the colourful lighting and the festive and cosy vibe are what make Christmas markets unique,\" says Anna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in Karolina's view, \"the star... is definitely the food and drink. [It's] what really makes a Christmas market authentic\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Anna and Karolina were enjoying the Berlin market</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other Christmas markets in the UK </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in the UK, while Birmingham can boast about its markets authenticity, what of other locations in the UK?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets have become a staple of many UK cities - Manchester, Leeds, Bath, Edinburgh and Newcastle among them. Smaller markets, typically in historic settings, are also proving popular on TikTok, sometimes incredibly so. Since 2023, Lincoln Christmas market has been closed because of overcrowding concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC visited the market in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, earlier this week, we saw an open mic night, including a rendition of Neil Young's Heart of Gold, and stalls selling the likes of pasta, Greek gyros and Yorkshire pudding wraps. There were also German foods and signs, though far fewer than Birmingham.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Berlin market was bustling with people of all ages</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Visitors didn't seem to mind though. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I quite like that,\" says Jamie Aycliffe, who was visiting the market with his wife and baby. \"We're doing our British version of the Bratwurst.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But having been to Christmas markets across Europe himself, he felt the ones in the UK were \"not as good\" and \"a bit more commercial\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others were visiting the Kingston Christmas market for the aesthetic.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's fun,\" drama student Amelia Shannon, 22, says. \"I don't have to go to Germany for it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall, though, this was not as true to the traditional thing as in Birmingham, and also much smaller in size. Some people told us they'd prefer it if UK-based Christmas markets like in Kingston's sold more small gifts from independent businesses, like German markets do.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Amelia Shannon (second from left) came to Kingston Christmas market with her friends, all drama students</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anne-Teresa Markovic, an academic originally from Nuremberg, says she was struck  by the range of food and drink offerings being \"more prominent\" there than in Germany while visiting Christmas markets in Manchester and Leeds. She recalls seeing \"festive patatas bravas\" on the menu, which needless to say, aren't particularly German.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets in Germany are changing, though. There's often now more international food - and Dr Karcher says depictions of the patron Saint Nikolaus are increasingly becoming more about Santa Claus.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Katharina Karcher has noticed Santa Claus becoming more prominent at German Christmas markets</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The warm glow exuded by Germany's Christmas markets was dimmed during deadly car attacks on a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59048891\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">market in Berlin in 2016</a> and in the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2l104k4vxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">city of Magdeburg last year</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security has been stepped up at markets since.

So far, they have not been realised. If someone has a better idea than us, then that is very welcome. Unfortunately I just doubt that this time will be more successful than last time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Reuters news agency, Orban told Putin that Hungary was \"interested in peace\" and added: \"Our meetings today give me the  opportunity to confirm, Mr President, that Hungary is ready to provide a platform for such negotiations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the atmosphere when the delegations met in Moscow appeared surprisingly frosty and at one point Orban inadvertently bumped into his Russian host, after shaking hands with other members of the Russian delegation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One independent Hungarian media outlet also suggested that Putin's words had been mistranslated into Hungarian, to sound more positive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month but they were shelved, reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas and start buying US nuclear fuel mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It is alleged that thousands of Palestinians have been detained by Israel since the Hamas attacks of October 7th 2023. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under Israel's laws on administrative detention and on Unlawful Combatants – suspects who cannot be classed as prisoner of war - they can be held for long periods without access to a lawyer or family members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many Palestinian families say they have waited months to even find out that a loved has been detained, amounting, the UN committee said, to \"enforced disappearance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee was particularly critical of Israel's reported use of the Unlawful Combatants law to detain whole groups of Palestinians, including children, pregnant women, and the elderly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is the reported conditions in detention which make the grimmest reading in the committee's conclusions, published today. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Palestinians, the evidence suggests, are regularly deprived of food and water, and subjected to severe beatings, attacks by dogs, electrocution, water boarding, and sexual violence. Some are allegedly permanently shackled, denied access to a toilet, and forced to wear diapers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee concluded that such treatment \"amounts to war crimes and crimes against humanity\". It said evidence of a \"de facto state policy of organised and widespread torture\" by Israel was one of the acts which constitute the crime of genocide under international law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel has repeatedly rejected accusations that it is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One committee member, Peter Vedel Kessing of Denmark, said he and his colleagues were \"deeply appalled\" by what they heard. Committee members also said they were very concerned at the lack of investigations or prosecutions into allegations of torture. They called on Israel to launch independent investigations, and to ensure those responsible, including senior military officers, are held accountable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel, which has long accused the UN of bias against it, did not comment publicly today on the committee's findings, but during the committee hearings its ambassador, Daniel Meron, described the allegations of torture as \"disinformation\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that Israel was \"committed to upholding its obligations in line with our moral values and principles, even in the face of the challenges posed by a terrorist organisation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its conclusions, the UN committee took care to unequivocally condemn the Hamas attack of October 2023, and acknowledged the security challenges Israel faces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it also warned that violations of international law by one side did not justify the other side doing the same. Under the convention, to which Israel is a party, the prohibition on torture is absolute: it is not allowed under any circumstances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel's domestic law is less clear however, suggesting that the convention only applies to Israeli territory, and not to the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank – an interpretation that many international lawyers dispute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The findings come amid increasing pressure on Israel over its human rights record. On Friday in Geneva, the UN Human Rights Office said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8dyqzm0rp4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the killing by Israeli soldiers of two Palestinians in the West Bank looked like a \"summary execution\"</a>. Video of the killing showed the two men with their hands up, apparently surrendering to Israeli forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And UN aid agencies say conditions for people in the Gaza strip remain dire, despite the ceasefire. Thousands of families are facing the winter cold and rain in tents, they warn, not enough aid supplies are getting in, and Israeli air strikes against what Israel says are Hamas targets continue.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Saudi Arabia also leans towards the army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple reports from investigative journalists and intelligence agencies show that the UAE has been arming the RSF, and it is reportedly increasing its supplies. The UAE has always denied this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first step towards peace is for the key regional states to cease fuelling the flames and instead use their influence for peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For six months, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and senior advisor for Africa Massad Boulos have been hammering out a plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They established the \"Quad\" - the US plus Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - and drafted a plan with three key elements: </p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">a ceasefire</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">access for humanitarian aid</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">negotiations to set up a government headed by civilians.</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Quad affirmed its plan in September and met again Washington last month.

The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards. In a presser on Friday they attributed the rapid spread of the fire to styrofoam blocks placed outside the windows of the apartments, apparently to \"protect\" them from the debris and dust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some experts also believe the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks helped fuel the inferno. Such scaffolding is an iconic sight across Hong Kong, and widely used in construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, authorities announced plans to phase out bamboo in favour of sturdier, fire-resistant steel, citing bamboo's combustibility and deterioration over time.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/571b/live/62968850-cb75-11f0-8acb-1b2068777e6f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Volunteers give out food and drinks after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Hundreds of residents have been evacuated to temporary shelters while emergency housing units are being allocated to some</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Residents at Wang Fuk Court had expressed unease about renovation plans when they were announced last year.

They have traded their pastoral tools for assault rifles, which have flooded Nigeria - and other states in the region - since Libya descended into anarchy following the overthrow in 2011 of long-time strongman Muammar Gadaffi by Nato-backed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs are not known to be motivated by any religious or political ideology, but see kidnapping people for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money rather than walking for miles with their livestock in search of water and grazing land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They typically move in large numbers on motorcycles, which makes them highly mobile and allows them to strike quickly and escape before the security forces can respond - a tactic used during two recent school abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no centrally organised leadership - each gang, often drawn from one family or a specific community, tends to be loyal to its own leader. The police have placed bounties on some of the notable leaders, including Ado Aleru and Bello Turji, and in 2022 the government designated the bandits as \"terrorists\" in a bid to stem their violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aleru is from Yankuzo town - an area in the north-western state of Zamfara which has been a hub for bandit activity over the last three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs, which sometimes fight one another, also travel to neighbouring states and central regions to carry out kidnappings. They also prey on their local communities and are indiscriminate in their ransom demands. In some areas, they tax residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Younger bandits, some in their teens, are increasingly taking to TikTok to show off their ransom money, guns and motorcycles - and have garnered thousands of followers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Boko Haram - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Islamist militant group became infamous around the world in 2014 for kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok - around 90 of whom remain missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It evolved from a local Islamist sect founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri with the official name of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad and a political goal of creating an Islamic state. Local residents dubbed it Boko Haram - a name which in the Hausa language loosely translates as \"Western education is forbidden\" because of their opposition to Western-style schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its full-blown insurgency was triggered in 2009 by the killing of Yusuf who had been taken into police custody after Boko Haram clashed with the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At one point under its new leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram controlled large swathes of territory in Nigeria's north-east - and appointed \"emirs\" to administer some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chibok girls were only a small fraction of the many thousands of women and children taken into captivity and forced into sexual slavery, domestic servitude or used as suicide bombers by the militants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram then split into rival factions. After the death of Shekau four years ago, its strength has diminished, however it still conducts regular attacks on both civilians and security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram has spawned a range of groups that use kidnapping to raise funds, focusing on soft targets such as schools, churches, mosques and remote villages where paved roads and bridges are either inadequate or absent.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iswap - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Boko Haram commanders - including Abu Musab al-Barnawi, believed to be the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf - formed what became known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) in around 2016 as they felt Abubakar Shekau was violating Islamic doctrine by killing Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram routinely targeted markets and mosques, often with suicide bombers. Iswap generally avoids attacking Muslim civilians and focuses on military and government targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/west-africa/nigeria/b196-jas-vs-iswap-war-boko-haram-splinters\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Iswap is still locked in a violent turf war with Boko Haram</a>, with reports of deadly clashes between the two groups around Lake Chad earlier this month. In fact, Shekau is said to have killed himself during a battle with Iswap, exploding a suicide vest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains active and last week killed a Nigerian general, Brig Gen Musa Uba, after an ambush in Borno state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iswap commander Hussaini Ismaila was recently sentenced to 20 years in jail for multiple attacks in the northern city of Kano in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The north-eastern jihadist group was initially blamed for an attack on a Catholic church in the south-west of the country in June 2022 that killed at least 50 worshippers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors now believe it was a single cell linked to Somalia's al-Shabab jihadist group that was responsible. Five men are currently on trial for the attack and it is alleged they went to Somalia for training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind the two recent school kidnappings in the north-west of Nigeria in Kebbi and Niger states, but the government believes that Boko Haram and Iswap are behind them, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is a claim disputed by some experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits,\" conflict analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ansaru - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This splinter group has moved away from the north-east, where Boko Haram and Iswap dominate, to carry out its operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have participated in the 2022 attack on a high-speed train travelling between the capital, Abuja - in the centre of the country - and the city of Kaduna, about 200km (124 miles) north, in which at least seven people were killed and more than 100 commuters were abducted for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, Khalid al-Barnawi, was arrested in 2016 and is facing trial over several attacks, including the 2011 bombing of the UN building in Abuja. His trial is scheduled to resume in December 2025.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mahmuda - suspected Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Believed to be a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, it has set up in rural areas around Kainji Lake National Park in the west of the country since around 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is linked to the Islamic State group and has emphasised more moderate messaging in comparison to Boko Haram and proselytises in Hausa and other local languages to attract recruits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has carried out targeted killings, often riding in on motorcycles and attacking markets, vigilante groups set up to protect villagers from bandits and local communities in the western state of Kwara. In April, its fighters killed several vigilantes and attacked a market there, killing Fulani men and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their recent focus has shifted slightly north of Kwara - to Niger and Kebbi states - areas long plagued by bandit violence, where the two recent school abductions occurred.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lakurawa - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A relatively new Islamist militant group, Lakurawa has been attacking communities in Sokoto and Kebbi states in the north-west and in Niger, the country which borders Nigeria to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say it maintains ties with jihadist networks in Mali and Niger, and members have settled among border communities, marrying locally and recruiting young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially presenting itself as a protector against the bandits that roam the north-west, the group has gradually imposed harsh controls - such as checking villagers' phones for music, which is banned as it is considered un-Islamic, and flogging offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was declared a terrorist organisation in 2025 and accused of cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacking top government officials.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">JNIM - Sahel jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Active mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso, where it controls large areas, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), may be making inroads into Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A confirmed JNIM attack in northern Benin early in 2025 occurred close to the Nigerian border. In October 2025, the group claimed what would be its first attack inside Nigeria, in Kwara - the same state where more than 30 worshippers were abducted from a church last week and which has also seen increasing incursions by bandits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If JNIM activities are confirmed, it would complicate an already dire situation in parts of the country where Ansaru, Lakurawa, Mahmuda and the bandits are all active.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Herders v farmers - battles over resources</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This long-running conflict in central Nigeria - also known as the Middle Belt - has devastated communities, fuelling displacement and the spread of small arms as both herders and farmers arm themselves for what has become a deadly cycle of reprisal attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been framed by some as a religious fight, but the central grievance is over grazing rights - access to land and water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The herders are mainly Fulani Muslims, while the farmers are largely Christians from various ethnic communities, although some are Muslim. Fulani families traditionally walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find land for their prized cattle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But urbanisation has seen encroachment onto these age-old grazing routes and locals accuse the Fulani of letting their cattle trample their crops and forcing them out of their homes and fields.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notable clashes have taken place in Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states. In order to try and curb the violence, some state governments have imposed anti-open grazing laws and set up ranches for the herders - but have faced resistance from all sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fallout from the conflict is the establishment of ethnic militias that, in some cases, have turned to criminality, plundering the people they ostensibly claim to be protecting. Ethnic Tiv militias in Benue have been accused carrying out mass killings and some of their leaders have been killed or arrested by the security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ipob - separatist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The separatist violence in the south-east has its roots in calls for Biafran independence that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51094093\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">date back nearly 60 years to the brutal civil war that led to the deaths of up to a million people</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rebellion was crushed but demands for an independent state for the Igbo people of the region continued as some Igbos continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), led by Nnamdi Kanu, is one of the groups promoting that call for secession. In 2009 Kanu launched Radio Biafra that broadcast separatist messages to Nigeria from London. Ipob was designated as terrorist organisation in 2017 - and three years later Kanu created an armed wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Eastern Security Network (ESN), as it was called, and other splinter groups have since been implicated in arson, kidnappings and killings of civilians and security personnel in five states across the south-east. ESN has been in control of several towns in Imo and Anambra states where thousands were forced from their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, the separatists, who have killed many prominent people in the south-east, have imposed a stay-at-home order on Mondays, causing much economic hardship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg42y7kevdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Simon Ekpa, leader of a breakaway faction of Ipob called Biafra Republic Government In Exile, was convicted in Finland of terrorism</a> and other activities in Nigeria's south-east.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3z38e6v45o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kanu was convicted in Nigeria on terrorism-related charges</a> and given a life sentence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the judgement, he had written to Trump urging the US to investigate \"killings of Christians and Igbo people\" and his group and others have been promoting the \"Christian genocide\" narrative in America, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://search.justice.gov/search?query=Nnamdi+Kanu&amp;op=Search&amp;affiliate=justice_fara\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a BBC investigation into documents filed with the US justice department shows</a>.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">You may also be interested in:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
