In the minutes that followed, two gunmen would kill at least 15 people, and injure dozens more, authorities said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A local high school teacher, Chavi, told the BBC she dropped to the ground to protect her baby as \"bullets were flying above us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was pandemonium and chaos,\" another attendee, who identified himself as Barry, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3r711lnr8zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said as he described</a> watching a throng of people trying to escape the scene that had suddenly devolved into a nightmare.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one video verified by the BBC, upbeat music from the Hanukkah event can still be heard in the background as people crouch down and shots are heard, interspersed between shrieks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The eerily jubilant music continues playing while the camera pans over the grass, revealing prostrate bodies completely still, their condition unclear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separate footage shows groups of people lying atop one another on the grass, as one woman tries to cover a young child's head with her hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Panic soon spread from the park to the sand, where videos show terrified beach goers sprinting away from the gunfire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Screams, honking car horns and ambulance sirens fill the air in the next chaotic minutes.

The same team resumed talks on Monday morning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the start of the meeting, Volodymyr Zelensky signalled he would give up ambitions to join Nato in exchange for security guarantees.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recognising that \"some partners from the US and Europe\" did not support Ukraine's bid for Nato membership, Zelensky said he was instead seeking strong security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5 clause of mutual protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And this is already a compromise on our part,\" he said on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff has travelled to Moscow to hold talks with Vladimir Putin on several occasions, but Sunday's meeting at the chancellery in Berlin was the first time he met Zelensky. Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe General Alexus Grynkewich was also present at the talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several European leaders as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to join further talks with the Ukrainian and US delegations on Monday evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the core of the discussions in Berlin is the 20-point peace plan proposal presented to the US by Ukraine last week to counter an initial American plan which was seen as heavily favouring Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details haven't been shared, but last week Zelensky said the points should be seen as a \"foundation\" on which to build provisions for the reconstruction of Ukraine and security guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Russia, Kyiv's membership of Nato is a red line, and Moscow has repeatedly demanded that any ambitions for Ukraine to join the alliance are shelved forever. \"This issue is one of the cornerstones and requires special discussion,\" said the Kremlin on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US too has repeatedly stated it does not want Ukraine to be part of Nato. But Kyiv fears that a peace deal without watertight security guarantees would fail to detract Russia from attacking again.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the talks began, Zelensky also addressed the thorny issue of sovereignty over the eastern region of the Donbas, which Russia mostly occupies and which it wants Kyiv to hand over in their entirety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president said that while he was open to freezing the conflict along the current front line he was not prepared to have his troops withdraw from the percentage of the Donbas they still hold - unless Russian forces did the same in the areas they control. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For it to be a fair arrangement Russia would have to withdraw the same distance, Zelensky said. This matter was \"extremely sensitive and heated,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any proposal hashed out by the Ukrainian, American and European side will still have to be presented to Moscow – although Zelensky said that the US delegation \"so to speak present the Russian side's perspective, because they relay Russia's signals, demands, steps, and indications of readiness or lack thereof.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin said it expected the US to provide us with the \"concept\" discussed on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The talks in Berlin come at a crucial time for Ukraine, which is enduring its fourth winter of war amid sustained power cuts caused by Russia's attacks on its energy facilities. Over the weekend more than a million households in Ukraine were left without electricity following a barrage of strikes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later this week, EU countries will be voting on a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98nnd01g91o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plan to send €90bn (£78.6bn) worth of frozen Russian assets</a> held in a Belgium-based financial institution to prop up Ukraine's economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, EU governments agreed to immobilise the Russian assets indefinitely - but there is no consensus yet on whether they can be sent to Ukraine. Belgium has been resisting the legally contentious proposal, and in recent days other countries, including Italy, have said \"alternative options\" should be put forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas acknowledged the discussions were \"increasingly difficult\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But we're doing the work, and we still have some days,\" she added.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Kast has openly praised Chile's former right-wing dictator, Augusto Pinochet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first speech to supporters as president-elect, Kast said: \"Chile will once again be free from crime, free from anguish, free from fear.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Criminals, delinquents - their lives are going to change. We're going to look for them, find them, judge them and then we're going to lock them up,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a gathering of his backers in the capital Santiago, many draped in Chilean flags, chanting and taking selfies, there was jubilation as the results came through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism,\" said Augustina Trancoso, donning a red \"Make Chile Great Again\" cap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've been trying to win an election for years,\" said Belem Valdivieso. \"In Chile, you used to be able to walk the streets peacefully, lately we've experienced problems with insecurity. I'm hoping his promises will be kept and he'll focus on security.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout the campaign, Kast portrayed Chile as a country that was descending into chaos and insecurity. He pledged to restore order and crack down on irregular immigration, as well as implementing sharp spending cuts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast is an admirer of Donald Trump, who is likely to become a close ally, and his policies echo those of the US president. He has pledged a border wall on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia, maximum-security prisons, and mass deportations of irregular migrants, many of whom are from Venezuela.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Augustina Trancoso voted for Kast in Sunday's presidential election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chile is one of the safest and more stable countries in South America, but a rise in immigration and organised crime in recent years has concerned many voters. Kast regularly drew links between the two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His critics, though, say the problem is being exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One voter in Santiago, Javiera Carrasco, liked some of Kast's policies but ended up voting for Communist Party member Jara. She said she felt \"like a false sense of insecurity is becoming widespread.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here. It just doesn't add up for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chile's murder rate is now falling, and some studies suggest those born abroad commit fewer crimes on average. But the perception of growing insecurity was the motivation for many of Kast's voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are transforming into Colombia, a lot of terrorism, thieves, robbery, society is very unsafe,\" one voter Max Struber said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It may sound harsh to say it, but we need the government to continue Pinochet's work.

They were the biggest challenge to his rule that he has ever faced. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prisoners' release now is the result of long and complex negotiations led by the US that culminated in a two-day visit to Minsk this week by Donald Trump's new special envoy, John Coale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Lukashenko, that engagement itself is a win: after years as a political pariah in the West he is clearly happy to be back on talking terms with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he also got US sanctions dropped on a key export for his country, potash, as a further, more tangible reward. EU penalties - and tougher policies - are still in place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not entirely clear what Trump has to gain from this.

Instead, we learned, just seven foreign nationals had been brought to Lithuania and only Ales Bialiatski of the Belarusians.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Optimism and activism'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The others, including Kolesnikova, had been taken out of Belarus to Ukraine: from prison, into a war zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Staying in their own country is not usually an option on offer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Lukashenko's idea, who else?\" was how one of opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya's team interpreted the surprise diversion to Ukraine. It seems he'd decided to play one final power game, so the family reunions, so long awaited, would be delayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what of the price paid for that moment? Tikhanovskaya is a friend and political ally of Masha Kolesnikova, but she always calls for maximum pressure on Lukashenko by the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So has the US gone too far, I wondered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a process of negotiation.

This is not a sign of sudden humanity, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a short time inside the US embassy, Ales Bialiatski emerged onto the street to ecstatic cheers from the crowd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaunt, head shaven and still in his padded blue prison jacket, he admitted his head was spinning from all the sensations after four years in jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was driven across Belarus in a blindfold, from east to west, so I still can't get my head round it.

Elections have been suspended since martial law was declared when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the White House's diplomatic push continues, attention in Europe is focused on how to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, with talks ongoing over security guarantees and funding. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian government faces a stark financial situation: it needs to find an extra €135.7bn (£119bn; $159bn) over the next two years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, EU nations <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpkr83p73o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">agreed to indefinitely freeze around €210bn (£185bn; $247) worth of Russian assets</a> held in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hoped the agreement paves the way for the funds to be loaned back to Ukraine if a deal can be reached at an EU summit next week, providing Kyiv with financial help for its military and efforts to rebuild parts of the country left devastated after nearly four years of all-out war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That move has been condemned as theft by the Kremlin, and Russia's central bank has said it will sue Euroclear, a Belgian bank where the vast majority of Russian assets frozen after the invasion are held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials are still negotiating the exact structure of a deal to repurpose the Russian assets on behalf of Ukraine, with the Belgian government particularly sceptical due to its legal exposure as the main holder. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elsewhere, it was reported that the latest version of the peace plan being circulated envisions Ukraine rapidly joining the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Financial Times said Brussels backed Ukraine's swift accession to the bloc, an idea proposed by Ukraine in the latest draft it has given to Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine formally applied to join the EU days after the 2022 invasion, but despite promises of an accelerated process is still several years away from becoming a member.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the plan, Ukraine would become a member as soon as January 2027, AFP reported, citing an unnamed senior official.

It added that six civilians had also been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Cambodia said at least 11 civilians had been killed and 59 others injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 700,000 people have been evacuated on both sides of the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had claimed earlier in the week that he could stop the fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces that broke out on Monday just by picking up the phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After speaking to both prime ministers on Friday night he wrote on social media that the two countries had agreed to \"cease shooting effective this evening\" and go back to the agreement they signed in front of the US president in October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both countries are ready for peace,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in their comments after speaking to the US president, neither side mentioned an imminent ceasefire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anutin said he told Trump that Thailand was not the aggressor, and that Cambodia must show that it had withdrawn its forces and removed landmines from the border before a ceasefire was possible. \"They must show us first,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cambodian leadership said they must fight on to protect their country's sovereignty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was no mention of the use of tariffs as leverage to force the two sides to disengage, as happened in July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand has warned the US not to link the conflict to trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday Cambodia reported that it had been struck by more Thai air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"On December 13, 2025, the Thai military used two F-16 fighter jets to drop seven bombs\" on a number of targets, the Cambodian defence ministry said in an X post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Thai military aircraft have not stopped bombing yet,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai military also confirmed that fighting continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The long-standing border dispute escalated on 24 July, as Cambodia launched a barrage of rockets into Thailand, which responded with air strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both countries have accused each other of initiating the attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After days of intense fighting which left dozens dead, the neighbouring South East Asian countries agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. This was formalised at a ceremony in Malaysia in October presided over by the US president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines, which have caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Cambodia says the mines are left over from the civil war in the 1980s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, tensions continued to build.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week, Thailand launched air strikes inside Cambodia after two of its soldiers were injured in a skirmish last Sunday. Cambodia has responded with rocket barrages. The fighting affected six provinces in north-eastern Thailand and six provinces in Cambodia's north and north-west.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two countries have been been contesting their 800km land border for more than a century. The border was drawn by French cartographers in 1907, when France was the colonial ruler in Cambodia.</p></div></div></body></html>"

A synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne last year, a Jewish MP's office was vandalised and a car was torched in Sydney. A childcare centre in Sydney was also set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two Australian nurses were suspended and charged this year after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. There was also an anti-Jewish protest outside the New South Wales (NSW) parliament in November, organised by a neo-Nazi group. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As people began to quietly gather on a grassy slope on Monday in front of the iconic Bondi Pavillion, reflecting on the terror of the night before, Prime Minister Albanese visited to pay his respects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil - an act of terror and an act of antisemitism,\" he said later on Monday, before rattling through a list of things he says his government has done to stamp it out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This includes setting up a federal police taskforce to investigate antisemitic incidents, and an amendment to hate crime laws. Hate symbols, including performing a Nazi salute, and terror offences are now punishable with mandatory jail terms.  NSW set up its own state-level task force because many of the recent incidents were in Sydney.  </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95f7/live/15b9d5a0-d98a-11f0-aabd-339166c2b10a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Isabelle Rodd Katherine Pierce kneels in front of floral tributes and prays\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/Isabelle Rodd</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Katherine Pierce is worried about the country's future</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Albanese's words were nowhere near enough to console Nadine Saachs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing side by side with her sister, both draped in Israeli flags, she says the government set the tone in October 2023 on the day after the horrific attack on Israel by Hamas.

It is happening just as Moscow's own shadow war on Europe is escalating again with a wave of arson and sabotage attacks that officials link to Russian intelligence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emergency response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lithuanian government has declared an emergency situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Balloons have been used by smugglers before, but this October their number suddenly surged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course it started as organised crime activity across the border, but we've seen more than once how Belarus instrumentalises organised crime to have an effect on neighbouring countries,\" Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told the BBC in the capital Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says the balloons are launched from spots that help them best \"target\" Lithuania's main airport, just 30km (19 miles) from the border.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want to make a smuggling operation to take a couple of thousand packs of cigarettes to the other side, you'd do it in the woods or the swamps, not directly at our airport!\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he believes the balloons are a form of political blackmail on Europe's eastern edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Belarus] sees this as leverage: 'You have a border with us, we can cause you huge problems',\" Budrys says. \"What they're doing is really touching the military and security field and we want to prevent a military escalation.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now every night the military police head out on patrol in the border zone. The balloons are most common after dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rattling across fields to reach remote country roads, they then set up mobile checkpoints and step out to stop vehicles at random. They check the drivers' documents and search car boots looking for anyone who may be involved in the smuggling, in the hope of smashing the networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The balloons fly too high to make shooting them down with air defences a safe or economic option, so the government has offered a €1m (£870,000) prize to any firm that can figure out how to intercept them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, teams use military radar to track the balloons in the sky and try to catch smugglers who turn up where the cargo drops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, new criminal charges should also act as a deterrent - with a possible prison sentence for acts of sabotage against civil aviation.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Authorities are patrolling the roads at night, searching for smugglers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the best protection for now is a change in wind direction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was blowing east into Belarus the night we were out with the patrol and the only boxes the soldiers found in a car were full of Christmas shopping not contraband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't seen any balloons, it hasn't affected us personally,\" the woman driver told me after the spot check. \"But we live really close to the border and this whole situation really does worry us.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Belarus up to?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The border itself is now marked by a tall metal fence, with a coil of vicious-looking barbed wire on top and more beyond. Below are giant concrete blocks marking the line before a Belarusian flag and a border post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this extra security is the most obvious sign of how Lithuania now views its neighbour - and its ally Russia - as hostile and dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not far away in Minsk, the man who has ruled Belarus for three decades, Alexander Lukashenko, dismisses all the talk of hybrid warfare as \"nonsense\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recently blamed \"bandit\" smugglers for the balloons, saying they were just seeking a profit and getting creative about overcoming the new security fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lithuania doesn't buy that, partly because Belarus already has form when it comes to \"hybrid\" attacks on the border. In 2021 migrants trying to reach the EU were helped to cross into Lithuania and Poland in big numbers, provoking a deliberate crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are other signs of state involvement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vilnius, Vilmantas Vitkauskas runs the crisis management centre that brings together various branches of government and security services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before, he says, smugglers would send their balloons in clusters to overwhelm security forces on the other side. \"Now they are doing a sequence of one or two balloons every 30 minutes, aimed directly at the airport,\" he explains in front of a giant digital wall map that charts all the balloons spotted so far this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Lukashenko's Belarus... if they were interested in stopping it they can do it tomorrow. But they don't. That means it benefits them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspicion is that Belarus is trying to bully its way into reducing sanctions.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vilmantas Vitkauskas says if Belarus wanted to stop the balloons, it would</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They want to attract political attention and force us to change our policies towards Belarus,\" is how minister Kestutis Budrys sees the sudden influx of balloons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU doesn't recognise Alexander Lukashenko as president because he imprisoned his main opponents ahead of disputed elections in 2020 and oversaw a brutal crackdown afterwards. The sanctions that were imposed then were tightened two years later when he helped Vladimir Putin launch Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First, they want to end the international isolation of the regime and number two, of course, the sanctions,\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has just<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> agreed to lift some sanctions on Belarus,</a> with the country afterwards freeing 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Budrys argues for a harder line with Minsk from Europe. \"We have to expand the sanctions regime against Belarus to include hybrid activities against the EU,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was done with Russia, but not with Belarus.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disruption and delays</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, travellers to and from Lithuania – and the airlines – are having to adapt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is something completely new for the aviation sector, none of the airports in Europe experienced that,\" airport CEO Simonas Bartkus says, inside a shiny new terminal in Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One airline has already relocated its charter flights to Lithuania's second city and another has cut its evening flight service to Vilnius. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bartkus estimates the loss of revenue for all affected businesses will reach €2m by the end of the year. \"One thing is the extra cost for us and the airlines, but the even higher risk is if passengers start to lose trust in air travel,\" he admits.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Martynas (right) says Nato is being tested - \"And we can't even fight simple balloons\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Already, travellers check a new webpage that gives the wind forecast and the likelihood of balloons floating into their flight path before booking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not easy, it makes me a little bit nervous.

But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images US President Donald Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin \n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with Russia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind?

Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WPA Pool/Getty Images (left to right) British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday.

All remaining in-person exams and classes for the semester have been cancelled. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two deceased have been identified as university students MuhammadAziz Umurzakov and Ella Cook. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on the campus brings the number of mass shootings in the US to 389 for this year, according to the independent analysis website <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Gun Violence Archive</a>.

released them because they did not think that person was the same individual who was seen in CCTV footage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That footage showed a male suspect, walking away from the scene of the shooting wearing all black clothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no weapon visible in the video, and his face is covered.

In others, it was a backlash against leftist governments mired in corruption or infighting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Chile, immigration and crime seemed to swing it.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast promised a border wall and mass deportations of undocumented migrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At rallies, he counted down the days until the inauguration and warned that those without papers should leave by then if they wanted the chance to ever return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His message resonated in a country which has seen a rapid growth in its foreign-born population. Government figures show that by 2023 there were nearly two million non-nationals living in Chile, a 46% increase from 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government estimates about 336,000 undocumented migrants live in Chile, many from Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The speed of that change has unsettled many Chileans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Chile was not prepared to receive the wave of immigration it did,\" says Jeremías Alonso, a Kast supporter who volunteered to mobilise young voters during the campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He rejects critics' accusations that Kast's rhetoric amounts to xenophobia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What Kast is saying is that foreigners should come to Chile, let them come to work, but they should enter properly through the door, not through the window,\" he says, arguing that undocumented migrants are a strain on taxpayer-funded public services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says his working-class neighbourhood has experienced \"the social changes that irregular immigration brings in terms of crime, drug addiction and security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jeremías Alonso supported José Antonio Kast in the election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast has blamed rising crime on immigration, an allegation that resonates politically even as the number of murders has fallen since peaking in 2022, and despite some studies suggesting migrants commit fewer crimes on average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many voters cite organised crime, drug trafficking, thefts and carjackings as contributing towards their sense of insecurity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast's victory message is that migrants will be welcome if they comply with the law, criminals will be locked up and order will return to the streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He, like Trump, is expected to move quickly to demonstrate an \"iron fist\" approach, deploying the military to the border and probably promoting his crackdown through social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in practice, large-scale deportations will be difficult. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela does not accept deportees from Chile and deportations have so far been limited. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kast seems to hope his rhetoric will encourage irregular migrants to leave voluntarily.

He's validating it,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recalls how at the restaurant where he works, he served diners who were discussing how migrants should leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was uncomfortable. I'm a foreigner, and I'm hearing all those super hurtful words.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He explains that about 90% percent of the restaurant's staff are migrants. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With migrants increasingly key to Chilean businesses, Kast could come up against opposition from those relying on foreign labour for their business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carlos Alberto Cossio, a Bolivian national who has lived in Chile for 35 years, runs a business making and delivering salteñas, savoury Bolivian pastries. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Carlos Alberto Cossio says migrant workers are key to his business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he has often employed workers from Haiti, Colombia and Venezuela and insists that \"the migrant workforce is very important\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He explains that migrants are eager to work and less likely to change jobs as they rely on their employer for a contract visa until they are issued with a permanent visa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many companies, especially in fruit harvesting, employ migrant workers who are not necessarily registered,\" he adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Expelling unregistered workers \"will impact Chile's export economy and make raw materials more expensive,\" he warns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Cossio acknowledges that there has been some friction since large numbers of migrants arrived from Venezuela to escape the economic and political crisis there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many of the customs they have brought haven't been compatible with Chilean customs,\" he says, lamenting how this has damaged the reputation of migrants who want to work and contribute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Kast's party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning some of his proposals, from tougher sentencing to maximum-security prisons, may require compromise and negotiation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for many voters, the perception of control may matter just as much as delivering results as anxiety over crime, insecurity and migration is sweeping the continent.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That's how Hollywood's creative workers describe the fall of the once mighty Warner Bros, as Netflix and Paramount battle to buy the historic studio and tinsel town braces for more upheaval and job losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner's decline and impending sale – whether it's to Paramount Skydance as a whole, or to Netflix cut up in parts – is being mourned in Hollywood, where a historic production slump has already battered the entertainment industry. The loss of the studio, which has created iconic films ranging from Casablanca and Goodfellas to Batman and Harry Potter, likely means more job cuts and definitely means one less buyer of film and TV projects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interviews with dozens of actors, producers and camera crews by the BBC reveal an industry attempting to weigh the lesser of two evils: control by a tech giant blamed for killing movie theatres (Netflix) or billionaires seen as too cosy with President Trump (Paramount).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"David Ellison is a right-wing billionaire Trumper,\" a camera assistant said of the Paramount Skydance CEO who is the son of billionaire Oracle co-founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison. \"Netflix is much more historically inclined to not micromanage production.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Netflix gets the deal they want, they will buy Warner Bros' crown jewels – the 102-year-old studio, HBO, and its vast archive of films and TV shows – leaving Warners's legacy TV networks, like CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery, for another buyer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Paramount Skydance's $108bn(£81bn) <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21z4zgkx7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">hostile takeover</a> bid for Warner Bros includes backing from Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, Qatar and a fund started by Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has raised concerns about the possibility of censorship and government overreach.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump added fuel to the fire when he said \"it's imperative that CNN be sold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Warner Bros deal is the latest in a long line of major shake-ups in Hollywood since the pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Film and TV productions ground to a halt in 2023 during simultaneous actor and writer strikes. Seemingly everyone in Hollywood was working in 2022 as studios and streaming services went into creative overdrive after Covid shutdowns. But when the labour strikes ended, the production boom never returned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fallout has meant that many media companies have had to close doors - or merge. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4qwwk0g0yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">David Ellison's Skydance Media bought Paramount</a>, another legendary Hollywood studio, earlier this summer, leading to thousands of job losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Warner Bros put up a for-sale sign, Paramount launched an eager campaign to buy the company. But the studio ultimately announced a deal with Netflix. A spurned Paramount then went direct to Warner Bros Discovery shareholders with a hostile takeover offer that they say is \"superior\" to the Netflix deal.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2c70/live/73296860-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A birds-eye view of the Warner Bros lot shows multiple large studios, with the studio at the centre emblazoned with the Warner Bros logo\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether they're rooting for Paramount or Netflix or another potential buyer, the one thing people in Hollywood seem to agree on is this story's villain - Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who earned $51.9m last year as Warner Bros lost more than $11bn and the company's stock fell nearly 7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I watched Warner Bros struggle since David Zaslav became the CEO and ran it into the ground,\" says an actor who lost his home after his work dried up. He did not want to be identified because he still hopes to work for Netflix and Paramount.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than one person compared Mr Zaslav to the fictional movie character Gordon Gekko who proclaims \"greed is good\" in the 1987 movie Wall Street.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Zaslav took over in 2022 during another massive merger of Discovery, Inc., which he ran, with AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia, creating Warner Bros Discovery. The consolidation saw several thousand jobs cut - and lavish pay packages for Mr Zaslav.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Zaslav is just Gordon Gekko – he came in, broke it and sold it all,\" says a producer who was working on the Warner Bros lot. \"He said I will make all shareholders rich and who cares what the history of this place is.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros objected to that characterisation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Under the leadership of David and the talented team at WBD over the past three and a half years, the studio has regained its leadership position with a unique slate of films led by original content, seen the relaunch of the DC Universe under a single unified leadership team with ten year plan and the streaming service has launched globally and become profitable for the first time ever,\" Warner's head of communications Robert Gibbs said in a statement to the BBC. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many film workers, whoever buys Warner Bros has felt almost irrelevant. They have instead been focusing on how to reinvent themselves as the industry shrinks amid consolidation and the growing use of AI in entertainment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every morning, no matter how much I tell myself to stay positive, I wake up feeling like I've failed in every direction,\" says an actor who is now homeless with his wife and two children, relying on the kindness of friends and food banks while he works odd jobs. He asked not to be identified out of fear it could impact future work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would rather see Netflix purchase Warner Bros then foreign money,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others are not so sure. The tech giant has arguably been the industry's greatest disrupter since Warner Bros pioneered \"the talkies\" in 1927.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's a disaster,\" says a film exhibitor who did not want to be identified because they work with Netflix. \"This is a company openly, proudly saying theatres aren't necessary anymore. That's scary. It's a nightmare.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many theatres in the US refuse to screen Netflix movies because of their streaming-first strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At least with Paramount, we know movies will make it to the big screen. They didn't kill movie theatres,\" said one producer who has worked for all three companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix has sought to alleviate those fears, saying they expect \"to maintain Warner Bros' current operations and build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in Hollywood want to believe them.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d05/live/7fcabec0-d7a3-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images A look at the outside of the Egyptian Theater in Los Angeles.

I was happy to finally be in the land of dreams. I hoped they would accept me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His TikTok career also took off which gave him a steady income as fans sent him gifts as they watched his live streams. It also led to a threat on his life from the Somalia-based Islamist militant group al-Shabab because of his defence of the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Part of his asylum case in the US was based on that threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad describes in vivid detail the early May morning when immigration agents arrested him this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly after he had eaten breakfast, he went to his car thinking he was about to begin another day of Uber driving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Boom, they came for me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Mahad, he was taken on a 30-minute drive to the ICE headquarters serving Minneapolis and its twin city of St Paul, before being transferred on a six-hour journey to Kandiyohi County Jail Prison in Willmar, Minnesota, where he says he spent six months in detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He tells the BBC that three of those months were spent waiting for a decision on his asylum case, and the remaining three awaiting deportation. The authorities denied his asylum claim as they rejected the idea that he would be in danger in Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad says there were brief periods when he was transferred to Arizona, from where deportation fights leave, but he was told on each occasion that logistical arrangements were not ready.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one of these trips, he was part of a group of 39 detainees, including nationals of Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, in a holding area for people waiting to board deportation flights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Finally, when it came to his own departure, Mahad says he was put in a tight restraining jacket and travelled on a small plane with seven other deportees and some guards.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The journey first took them to Costa Rica, in Central America, then to Senegal in West Africa, before flying to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. There Mahad says the restraining jacket was removed and he was handcuffed and put on another plane to Mogadishu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having spent three months waiting to be deported, Mahad had already resigned himself to his fate and was not particularly emotional on his return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a decade apart, he has finally been reunited with his three children. \"I wouldn't trade this moment for anything now... I haven't seen them for 10 years,\" Mahad says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he would still prefer to be in the US because he fears for his life after receiving text messages from al-Shabab, containing death threats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He takes extra security precautions when he's out and lives in a well protected home but did not want to go into further details, or share the contents of the threats, for safety reasons.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b0/live/43f583b0-d1d8-11f0-9267-ab26a8fe8cc2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images Warmly dressed demonstrators rally outside a shop.

He understands that because of his social media presence he may get opportunities not available to other Somalis deported - or threatened with deportation - from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, President Donald Trump said he would end the temporary protection status that is supposed to prevent people from being deported while their home country is unsafe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, he upped the ante, saying that he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, telling reporters they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Somalia has not had a central government in control of the whole country since the toppling of President Siad Barre in 1991. People have had to endure years of near anarchy and insecurity - and even now, despite a government being in place in Mogadishu, Islamist militants still dominate much of the country and occasionally stage attacks in the capital.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump says he 'doesn't want' Somali migrants in US</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's comments came after he was questioned about large-scale fraud in the state of Minnesota's social assistance programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of people have been charged over a scheme that federal prosecutors say involved a charity fraudulently billing the state's government for meals for children during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of Somali immigrants were implicated in that alleged scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of the president's remarks about Somalis, videos have circulated on social media appearing to show immigration agents knocking on doors across Minneapolis, which includes an area known as Little Mogadishu, and St Paul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many in the city's Somali community, the largest in the US and numbering around 80,000, the posts have triggered alarm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also spoke to five young Somali men who now spend their days confined to a friend's small house, moving carefully through rooms that are not their own. They left their rented apartment abruptly last week not because they wanted to, but because the lease was under their names.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As people who had been given temporary protected status, they feared it was only a matter of time before ICE traced the address and came for them. They grabbed what they could carry and slipped away in the night, hoping the change of location would offer some protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, their lives are suspended. Work shifts are missed. Meals are skipped or stretched. One of the men described how quickly everything has collapsed: \"We're running out of food. We haven't reported to work for the past five days because we're scared that ICE might be waiting for us. I don't know what will happen to us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahad is far from being alone in being deported to Somalia in recent months, although there are no official figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also spoke to another young Somali man, who asked to remain anonymous. He said he was struggling to rebuild his life back in Mogadishu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From rural Somalia, he was desperate to leave as a prolonged drought had destroyed his livelihood. He illegally crossed into the US through the Mexican border after travelling north from Brazil but was detained shortly after. He spent 18 months in custody before being returned to Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on the phone, he describes feeling uncertain about his future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They sent me back to start from zero,\" he says. \"Everything I worked for just disappeared.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he spent around $20,000 (£15,000) to reach the US, including money he had borrowed from friends and family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning home, he has had no money and says there are no opportunities in Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't see a future here,\" he says. \"There is nothing going on… no employment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is now considering migrating once more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't want to start life again.

UN experts have previously accused it of having \"de facto control\" of the rebel force's operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda denies the allegations, however, its presence in Washington was a tacit acknowledgment of its influence over the M23.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rebels were not signatories to Trump's deal - and have been taking part in a parallel peace process led by Qatar, a US ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest fighting risks further escalating an already deeply complex conflict.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why did the M23 seize Uvira now?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Jason Stearns, a Canada-based political scientist who specialises in the region, told the BBC that the view in M23 circles was that \"they need more leverage in the negotiations\", while the feeling in the Rwandan government is that<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i>Tshisekedi cannot be trusted<i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the assault on Uvira, in South Kivu province, \"flies in the face of all the negotiations that are under way\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It appears to humiliate the US government. I'm not sure what strategic purpose that would serve,\" Prof Stearns told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23's new offensive in South Kivu started a few days before Kagame and Tshisekedi flew to Washington last week to ratify the agreement first hammered out in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bram Verelst, a Burundi-based researcher with the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank, said the assault appeared to be an attempt to force Burundi to withdraw the troops it had in eastern DR Congo backing the army against the rebel forces and Rwanda.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Uvira - which lies just 27km (17 miles) from Burundi's capital, Bujumbura, on the northern tip of Lake Tanganyika - was of strategic importance because of the presence of at least 10,000 Burundian troops in South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Uvira is Burundi's gateway into eastern DR Congo, to send troops and supplies. That has now been cut off,\" Mr Verelst told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It seems that many Burundian troops are withdrawing, but it's not clear if all contingents will retreat,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yale Ford, an Africa Analyst for the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, pointed out that Uvira, which had a population of about 700,000, was the DR Congo government's last major foothold and military hub in South Kivu. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/what-m23s-capture-of-uvira-means-for-the-drc-wider-region-and-peace-talks-africa-file-special-edition\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the M23 was now likely to establish a parallel administration in the city</a>, and use its military gains \"as a bargaining chip in peace talks\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the DR Congo government, it has not acknowledged its latest military setback, but says that the \"gravity of the situation is compounded by the now proven risk of regional conflagration\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What does it mean for Burundi?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has been a natural ally of DR Congo for years because of its enmity with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both accuse the other of backing rebel groups seeking to overthrow their respective governments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbours share a similar language and ethnic make-up - with Tutsi and Hutu communities often vying for power - and both have suffered terrible ethnic-based massacres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But unlike Rwanda, which is headed by a Tutsi president, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi's government fears that if the M23 cements its presence in South Kivu, it would strengthen a Burundian rebel group called Red Tabara.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Based in South Kivu, it is mainly made up of Tutsis - and has attacked Burundi in the past. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an apparent attempt to placate Burundi's fears, the M23 said it had \"no sights beyond our national borders\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our fight has the objective of peace, the protection of the population, the rebuilding of the state in DR Congo, as well as the stability of the Great Lakes region,\" the group added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundi has shut its border with DR Congo, but, according to Mr Verelst, it is still allowing people to cross into its territory after carrying out security checks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid agencies say that about 50,000 people have fled into Burundi in the past week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Burundian troops - along with the Congolese army and allied militias - fought to block the rebel advance towards Uvira, but the city itself fell \"without much fighting\", Mr Verelst said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Uvira would hit Burundi's already struggling economy as the country has been suffering from a severe shortage of foreign currency and fuel, and had been heavily dependent on eastern DR Congo for both, he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How did the M23 manage to capture Uvira?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The M23 began a major advance earlier this year when it captured Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, on the border with Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, South African troops were deployed to help DR Congo's army, but they were forced to withdraw after the M23 seized the city in January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly afterwards the rebels captured the next big city in eastern DR Congo, Bukavu, capital of South Kivu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move on Uvira came after the rebels broke the defence lines of the DR Congo army, militias allied with it and Burundian troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the M23 was estimated to have more than 10,000 fighters, but there was likely to have been an \"influx\" of Rwandan troops for the recent offensive to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The reason why they are able to defeat their enemy is that the Rwandan army, at least, is very disciplined, and I think discipline matters more than manpower,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The conflict in recent days has also featured the extensive use of drone technology on both sides but the Rwandans have used this more to their advantage than the Congolese,\" he added.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Where does this leave the peace process?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears to be in deep trouble.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US lays the blame for the recent fighting squarely on Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Instead of progress toward peace, as we have seen under President Trump's leadership in recent weeks, Rwanda is leading the region toward more instability and toward war,\" Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, told a Security Council meeting on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An earlier statement - issued by the US, European Union, and eight European governments - went further, saying that both the M23 and the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) should immediately halt \"offensive operations\", and Rwandan troops should withdraw from eastern DR Congo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the policy experts he had spoken to were \"baffled\" by the timing of the move to capture Uvira. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was literally as they were signing a peace deal in Washington that Rwandan troops were amassing, and then invaded the area around Kamanyola, which is across the border from Rwanda, and then advanced on Uvira,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Leaders of Rwanda and DR of Congo sign peace deal alongside Donald Trump</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rwanda's foreign ministry has not responded to the claims that its troops were in South Kivu, but said the ceasefire violations and fighting could not be \"attributed\" to Rwanda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It accused the DR Congo and Burundian armies of bombing villages near the Rwandan border, and said Burundi had \"amassed\" nearly 20,000 troops in South Kivu in support of DR Congo's army. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it was now clear that DR Congo was \"never ready to commit to peace\", and even though Tshisekedi had attended the ceremony in Washington, it was \"as if he had been forced to sign\" the peace accord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DR Congo's government levelled a similar accusation against Kagame, saying he had made a \"deliberate choice\"  to abandon the Washington Accord, and to undermine Trump's efforts to end the conflict.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Can the deal be salvaged?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said the US-led peace process was now on a \"troubled path, perhaps it is stuck\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that the success of the deal hinged on DR Congo's army launching an operation to disarm the FDLR militia group, members of which were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and which Kagame's government sees as a continued threat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, Prof Stearns said, he could not see DR Congo's army launching such an operation at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The peace deal also envisaged economic co-operation between DR Congo and Rwanda, including on hydro-electric power, mining and infrastructure development - something that the US hopes would pave the way for American companies to increase investments in the mineral-rich region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said he could not see this happening either while Rwandan troops remained in eastern DR Congo, and fighting continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that his understanding was that the parallel peace process in Doha - led by Qatar's government to broker a peace deal between the M23 and DR Congo's government - was also on hold at the moment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's very difficult to imagine the Congolese returning there right now after there has been this major offensive by the M23,\" he added. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are Tshisekedi's options?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Stearns said that Tshisekedi was under \"very serious\" pressure from the public for his failure to keep his numerous promises to bring an end to the fighting in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Tshisekedi might also be under pressure from parts of the army, with whom he had a strained relationship after the arrest of generals for alleged corruption and because of the setbacks in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Tshisekedi was banking on the US to put pressure on Rwanda to withdraw its support for the M23.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be very difficult for the Congolese army to muster a response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's now in the hands of the various peace brokers, the US in particular, and perhaps Qatar and other donors,\" the academic said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's to be seen how much they care about ending this conflict, and how much political capital they are willing to spend.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about the DR Congo conflict:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

But one key detail stuck out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office A note from police search of Mr Mangione\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prosecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Preposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald's</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A fake name leads to an arrest</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald's</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bullets, a journal and cash: a peek into Mr Mangione's backpack</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office Dozens of $100 bills found during Mr Mangione's arrest\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Evidence found during Mr Mangione's arrest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hearing is expected to continue into next week.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin in a dark suit with a burgundy tie patterned with white dots shakes hands with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who wears a dark suit and an orange tie with white dots\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025.
