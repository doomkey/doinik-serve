And that's very clear. This is because of the blockade.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added: \"[More than 1,000] people have died while trying to feed themselves. If they're not starving, imagine [why they're] risking their lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel imposed a total blockade of aid deliveries to Gaza at the start of March and resumed its military offensive against Hamas two weeks later, collapsing a two-month ceasefire. It said it wanted to put pressure on the armed group to release its remaining Israeli hostages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Although the blockade was partially eased after almost two months, amid warnings of a looming famine from global experts, the shortages of food, medicine and fuel have worsened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The WHO says a quarter of the 2.1 million population is facing famine-like conditions, and that almost 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 45 people have died as a result of malnutrition since Sunday, including two who died over the last 24 hours.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Gaza's healthcare system is on the brink of collapse after 21 months of war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, reject the accusation that it is imposing a siege and is responsible for any malnutrition cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Gaza today, there is no famine caused by Israel. There is, however, a man-made shortage engineered by Hamas,\" government spokesman David Mencer told a briefing on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Now, too often the full story is not being told. This suffering exists because Hamas has created it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mencer said more than 4,400 lorry loads of aid had entered Gaza over the past two months, but that about 700 lorry loads were waiting for collection at two crossing points for collection by the UN and its humanitarian partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is a bottleneck which has been caused by the United Nations, and it's the main obstacle to maintaining a consistent flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, UN agencies have said that it is nearly impossible to co-ordinate safe passage for their convoys with Israeli troops, leaving Palestinians at the mercy of a rapidly expanding starvation that is reaching every family in Gaza.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Born in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four.

JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A one million rupees [$11,600; Â£8,600] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbi.gov.in/press-detail/MjU0Mg==#:~:text=CBI%20ANNOUNCES%20A%20REWARD%20OF,STUDENT%20OF%20JAWAHARLAL%20NEHRU%20UNIVERSITY\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reward for information</a> about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images) JNU students with people from different organisations, during a protest march and dharna against Delhi Police over missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed at Jantar Mantar, on December 14, 2016 in New Delhi, India.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images)</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Najeeb Ahmed's disappearance sparked massive protests in Delhi in 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Explaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Colin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.

The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees says she's not done fighting.

Protests are set to continue this Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least five demonstrators have died while confronting official security forces in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it is not the orthodox political opposition â predictably crushed in local elections last week â that has mobilised frustrated young Togolese people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Instead it is musicians, bloggers and activists who have tapped into popular anger and weariness with a regime that has been in power â under the leadership of Faure GnassingbÃ© or, before him â his father GnassingbÃ© ÃyadÃ©ma, for almost six decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That outstrips even Cameroon's 92-year old President Paul Biya - <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ckglpnk0kqko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">who has just confirmed his intention to stand for an eighth successive term</a> in elections later this year â or Gabon's father-and-son presidents, Omar Bongo and Ali Bongo, latter of whom was deposed in a coup in August 2023.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The lessons of that episode did not escape Faure GnassingbÃ©, a shrewd and often discreet operator who quickly moved to devise a new constitutional structure for Togo, to prolong his own hold on power while playing down his personal profile, in a bid to defuse accusations of dynastic rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He will no longer need to stand for re-election in his own name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 59-year-old holds the premiership because his Union pour la RÃ©publique (Unir) party dominates the national assembly - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, thanks to a constituency map gerrymandered to over-represent its northern heartlands and understate the voting weight of the pro-opposition coastal south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Gilbert Bawara, Togo's civil service and labour minister, maintains the 2024 election was above board, with \"all the major political actors and parties\" taking part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The government cannot be held responsible for the weakness of the opposition,\" Bawara told BBC Focus on Africa TV last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that those with a genuine reason to demonstrate could do so within the law, blaming activists abroad for inciting \"young people to attack security forces\" in an attempt to destabilise the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The new constitutional framework was announced at short notice in early 2024 and quickly approved by the compliant government-dominated national assembly. There was no attempt to secure general public approval through a referendum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A one-year transition concluded this May as GnassingbÃ© â who had been head of state since 2005 â gave up the presidency and was installed in the premiership, a post now strengthened to hold all executive power and total authority over the armed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To occupy the presidency, a role now reduced to a purely ceremonial function, legislators chose the 86-year old former business minister, Jean-Lucien Savi de TovÃ©.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/fd0c/live/62d6db80-67f2-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Anadolu/Getty Images Four girls in colourful print clothes with headscarves on a motorbike driven by a young man in a grey sweatshirt and white helmet seen recently on a street in LomÃ©, Togo.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Anadolu/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Togo is one of the poorest countries in the world and has been governed by the GnassingbÃ© family for almost 60 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This reshuffling of the power structure was presented abroad by regime mouthpieces as moving from a strong presidential system to a supposedly more democratic \"parliamentary\" model â in tune with the traditions of the Commonwealth, which Togo, like Gabon, had joined in 2022, to broaden its international connections and reduce reliance on traditional francophone links with France, the former colonial ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The transition to new constitutional arrangements designed to perpetuate GnassingbÃ©'s rule passed off almost without outside comment from international partners whose attention is currently focussed on Gaza and Ukraine rather than Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nor was there any complaint from fellow leaders in the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), even after Togo held fresh legislative elections just weeks after the new constitution had been promulgated, in flagrant breach of the regional bloc's protocol on good governance and democracy, which says that after a change of constitution at least six months must elapse before any major election is held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Badly shaken by the decision of three military-run countries -
