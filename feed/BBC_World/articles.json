In 2024 that was €3.7bn. Legally using the interest is seen as safe as Russia is under sanction and the proceeds are not Russian sovereign property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But international military aid for Ukraine has slipped dramatically in 2025, and Europe has struggled to make up the shortfall left by the US decision to all but stop funding Ukraine under President Donald Trump.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are currently two EU proposals aimed at providing Ukraine with €90bn, to cover two-thirds of its funding needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One is to raise the money on capital markets, backed by the EU budget as a guarantee. This is Belgium's preferred option but it requires a unanimous vote by EU leaders and that would be difficult when Hungary and Slovakia object to funding Ukraine's military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That leaves loaning Ukraine cash from the Russian assets, which were originally held in securities but have now largely matured into cash. That money is Euroclear property held in the European Central Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU's executive, the European Commission, accepts Belgium has legitimate concerns and says it is confident it has dealt with them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan is for Belgium to be protected with a guarantee covering all the €210bn of Russian assets in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Should Euroclear suffer a loss of its own assets in Russia, a Commission source explained that would be offset from assets belonging to Russia's own clearing house which are in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Russia went after Belgium itself, any ruling by a Russian court would not be recognised in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a key development, EU ambassadors are expected to agree on Friday to immobilise Russia's central bank assets held in Europe indefinitely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now they have had to vote unanimously every six months to renew the freeze, which could have meant a repeated risk to Belgium.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU ambassadors are set to use an emergency clause under Article 122 of the EU Treaties so the assets remain frozen as long as an \"immediate threat to the economic interests of the union\" continues.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why Belgium is not yet satisfied</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belgium is adamant it remains a staunch ally of Ukraine, but sees legal risks in the plan and fears being left to handle the repercussions if things go wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A usually divided political landscape in this case has rallied behind Prime Minister Bart de Wever, who is under pressure from European colleagues and having talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in London on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Belgium is a small economy. Belgian GDP is about €565 bn – imagine if it would need to shoulder a €185bn bill,\" says Veerle Colaert, professor of financial law at KU Leuven University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the EU might be able to secure sufficient guarantees for the loan itself, Belgium fears an added risk of being exposed to extra damages or penalties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Colaert also believes the requirement for Euroclear to grant a loan to the EU would violate EU banking regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Banks need to comply with capital and liquidity requirements and shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket. Now the EU is telling Euroclear to do just that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why do we have these bank rules? It's because we want banks to be stable. And if things go wrong it would fall to Belgium to bail out Euroclear. That's another reason why it's so important for Belgium to secure water-tight guarantees for Euroclear.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Europe under pressure from every direction</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no time to lose, warn seven EU member states including those closest to Russia such as the Baltics, Finland and Poland. They believe the frozen assets plan is \"the most financially feasible and politically realistic solution\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a matter of destiny for us,\" warns leading German conservative MP Norbert Röttgen. \"If we fail, I don't know what we'll do afterwards. That's why we have to succeed in a week's time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Russia is adamant its money should not be touched, there are added concerns among European figures that the US may want to use Russia's frozen billions differently, as part of its own peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has said Ukraine is working with Europe and the US on a reconstruction fund, but he is also aware the US has been talking to Russia about future co-operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An early draft of the US peace plan referred to $100bn of Russia's frozen assets being used by the US for reconstruction, with the US taking 50% of the profits and Europe adding another $100bn. The remaining assets would then be used in some kind of US-Russia joint investment project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An EU source said the added advantage of Friday's expected vote to immobilise Russia's assets indefinitely made it harder for anyone to take the money away. Implicit is that the US would then have to win over a majority of EU member states to vote for a plan that would financially cost them an enormous sum.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The simplest answer is that they're a rite of passage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putting the show together, Swift says she was \"thinking of all the girls I was before this one,\" while re-recording her albums and \"surgically tweaking\" songs to make them fit the show.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would seem the tears are a manifestation of feeling fully seen through her lyrics - of not feeling like you're being \"too much,\" or \"too dramatic,\" or \"too sensitive,\" as Swift broadly puts it - and having the freedom to express femininity without shame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As you watch, it becomes clear that these record-breaking shows were intended as a place safe to explore a wide spectrum of emotions and, in that, they truly succeeded.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Maduro vowed on Wednesday that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the White House press secretary told reporters on Thursday that the US was

However, his belief in inevitable progress was not based on an optimistic or high-minded view of human nature. On the contrary, it comes close to Hobbes's outlook: man's violent and conflict-prone nature makes it necessary to establish and maintain an effective legal framework in order to secure peace. We cannot count on people's benevolence or goodwill, but even 'a nation of devils' can live in harmony in a legal system that binds every citizen equally.

On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she told parliament after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d9l7w1g8yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">news of the first legal challenge</a> broke last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that case, which the High Court has agreed to consider at an as-yet undecided date next year, two 15-year-olds from New South Wales are claiming the social media ban is unconstitutional as it infringes \"the implied freedom of communication on governmental and political matters\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Democracy doesn't start at 16 as this law says it will,\" Macey Newland told the BBC after their case was filed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban, which has excited global leaders and worried tech companies, has also been criticised by some who argue blanket prohibition is neither practical nor wise.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts fear kids are going to circumvent the ban with relative ease - either by tricking the technology that's performing the age checks, or by finding other, potentially less safe, places on the net to gather.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And backed by some mental health advocates, many children have argued it <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg9e1nl40wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">robs young people of connection</a> - particularly those from LGBTQ+, neurodivergent or rural communities - and will leave them less equipped to tackle the realities of life on the web.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the policy is wildly popular with parents and has won the support of people like talk show host Oprah Winfrey, and Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on their website, the pair lauded the \"bold\" action from Australia but said \"it shouldn't have come to this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope this ban is only the start of a reckoning between society and the tech companies that built these platforms with growth as their first principle instead of safety.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the US state of Florida to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.</p></div></div></body></html>"

icy objects which Nasa calls 'cosmic snowballs' - or in rarer cases, including the Geminids, asteroids, which are rocky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When dust and gases from these objects enter our atmosphere, they burn up and create the bright streaks we know as shooting stars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most meteors appear white, some can glow green, yellow, red, or blue, depending on the elements in the material as it burns up in Earth's atmosphere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Metals such as sodium, magnesium, and calcium produce colours similar to those seen in fireworks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Geminids shower comes from the remnants of an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, scientists thought the Geminids were a result of dust escaping from 3200 Phaethon. But two years ago <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/asteroids-comet-like-tail-is-not-made-of-dust-solar-observatories-reveal/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> scientists revealed</a> that Phaethon's tail is actually made of glowing sodium gas. So there is still some uncertainty about how and when the Geminids dust was formed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Geminids offer one of the year's best chances, weather-permitting, of seeing a shower, due to the volume and frequency of its 'shooting stars'.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What you'd be looking at in a nice dark sky without clouds would be, say, 100 an hour, which is amazing, said Dr Robert Massey of the Royal Astronomical Society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's pretty much the strongest meteor shower of the year.\" </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will moonlight spoil the show this year?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/653a/live/c1f997b0-d1d3-11f0-9c0d-83f64f80aa08.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A person stands on a snow-covered ridge at night looking at the sky, where a bright vertical Geminids meteor streak appears among numerous stars.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bright moonlight can make it more difficult to see meteors and other objects in the night sky.

And this is one of them. So go out and enjoy it. You know, it's a way of connecting with the sky, taking a moment to sort of forget our more earthly or more worldly concerns,\" said Dr Massey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meteors appear to radiate from the constellation of Gemini, but looking slightly away from that point often provides a wider field of view.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dress warmly and take a blanket or reclining chair to get comfortable, and let your eyesight adapt to the dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You just basically need to have reasonable eyesight to see this and I think that is incredible.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What will the weather be like for the Geminids peak?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Geminids meteor shower peaks on Sunday 14 December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unfortunately, the weather in the UK isn't looking ideal for viewing. Both Saturday and Sunday are expected to be windy and cloudy, with outbreaks of rain during the day and night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday night, there may be a few drier, clearer spells.

It wanted Anutin to start reforms of Thailand's military-drafted constitution and to dissolve the house within four months, among other things.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The People's Party has now accused Bhumjaithai of failing to honour that deal.

One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Deeply offensive' body search</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the school</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They forcibly dragged me into the car.

You get severe bruising.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessions</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the hand</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Viral letters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online. They went viral and as public pressure grew, the police intervened and she was allowed to leave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twelve days later, authorities announced Shengbo school was closing, but made no reference to the abuse Enxu alleged, saying, however, that the school had violated administrative regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says the police later told her Li Zheng had been arrested, accused of involvement in organised crime. The police did not respond to BBC requests for information about Enxu's case and Mr Li. The local education department have also not responded.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a5e0/live/6d32c710-d511-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Secret filming A group of eight students wearing dark T-shirts and black shorts stand to attention, facing away from the camera, on a running track. behind them is a cream-coloured building.

The BBC has analysed his network and found it operates disciplinary schools across four provinces through a complex set of companies registered to him or his close associates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He founded his first centre in 2006 and has owned four different education companies at different times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The website of one of his organisations says he is a graduate of a Chinese Air Force academy in southern China, and worked as a \"director of training\" and \"senior psychological counsellor\" at several schools from 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On local television in Hunan province, he once spoke about nurturing young people with \"love and patience\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese authorities have intervened before, following allegations about schools in the network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An instructor at a different Li Zheng school was detained by police in 2019 after allegations he had beaten students with water pipes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, according to Chinese media reports, the school Baobao attended was ordered to stop admissions after a student suicide in 2020. She was there at the time and says it continued to operate over that period. It changed its name soon afterwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mu Zhou, an Australia-based volunteer who has been helping document allegations of abuse, says \"whenever there's public outcry, he [Li Zheng] would alter the name or change the legal representative\".

President Donald Trump has called on Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is it Venezuela's oil that Trump really wants? And would it actually be worth it?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">How much oil does Venezuela have?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is true that with an estimated 303 billion barrels, Venezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the amount of oil the country actually produces today is tiny by comparison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Output has dropped off sharply since the early 2000s, as former President Hugo Chavez and then the Maduro administration tightened control over the state-run oil company, PDVSA, leading to an exodus of more experienced staff.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though some Western oil firms, including the US company Chevron, are still active in the country, their operations have shrunk significantly as the US has widened sanctions and targeted oil exports, aiming to curb Maduro's access to a key economic lifeline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctions - which the US first put in place in 2015 during President Barack Obama's administration over alleged human rights violations - have also left the country largely cut off from the investment and the parts it needs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The real challenge they've got is their infrastructure,\" says Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Venezuela produced an estimated 860,000 barrels per day, according to the latest oil market report from the International Energy Agency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is barely a third of what it was 10 years ago and accounts for less than 1% of world oil consumption.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Does Trump want Venezuela's oil?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the US have made the case for intervention in Venezuela by pointing to the opportunities for American businesses to revive the oil industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuela, for the American oil companies, will be a field day,\" Florida Republican congresswoman María Elvira Salazar <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6385537628112\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said</a> in a recent interview on Fox Business. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"American companies can go in and fix all the oil pipes, the whole oil rigs and everything that has to do with... oil and the derivatives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump might seem open to such arguments. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He campaigned on the slogan \"drill, baby, drill\" and has generally called for expanding oil production, which he has tied to lower prices for Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Venezuela, the White House has said it is concerned about drug trafficking and what it sees as Maduro's illegitimacy.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coast</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked on Thursday whether the US campaign in the region was about drugs or oil, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration was focused on \"many things\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She called stopping the flow of illegal drugs to the US its \"number one\" priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clayton Siegle, a senior fellow for energy security at the think tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says he takes such pronouncements \"largely at face value\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed to the longstanding interest in the region of key players like Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just have not seen the supporting evidence that oil is at the centre of its ambitions,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What interests does US have in Venezuela?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's not to say that US companies would not be interested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, Chevron is the only American oil producer still active in Venezuela, after receiving a licence under former President Joe Biden in 2022 to operate, despite US sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration extended the firm another waiver this year, though it has revoked exemptions for other firms, such as Spain's Repsol, in a bid to curb the flow of funds to the Maduro regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, Chevron accounts for about a fifth of Venezuela's oil production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say Chevron would be among those best-placed to benefit, should the US start to lift its barriers against dealing with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Refiners in the US, particularly those around the Gulf Coast, are also hungry for the \"heavier\" type of crude that Venezuela produces, which tends to be less expensive and therefore more profitable to process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has been problematic for US Gulf Coast refiners in recent years that Venezuela has been under sanctions and been reducing production, because it means there's less of that heavy crude available,\" says Matt Smith, oil analyst at Kpler. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if they weren't getting involved in the production side of things, they would be a keen buyer of it.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What are the challenges?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While any expansion of oil exports from Venezuela could help bring down prices in the US, analysts say that would take time, with its current output too limited to make a significant impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And restoring Venezuela's oil industry to its former glory would be a heavy lift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a recent Wood Mackenzie <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.woodmac.com/blogs/energy-pulse/what-could-change-in-venezuela-mean-for-oil-production/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report</a>, improved management and some modest investments could help boost oil production in Venezuela to about two million barrels per day over the next two years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But analysts warned it would take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to raise output more significantly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also said companies could be put off by potential complications like its membership in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec).</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November.

That's a major blow to the population,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,\" he said. \"If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An aerial shot of a mosque standing amid a sea of uprooted tea trunks\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Experts suggest that as much as 7,200 hectares of forest was destroyed in the recent cyclone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand.

They began demolishing buildings with explosives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was a striking change of heart. For years, Myanmar's military rulers turned a blind eye to the multi-billion dollar scam business expanding rapidly along its border with Thailand. Local warlords allied to the military have been the principal protectors and business partners of the Chinese scam bosses, and have become very rich. Some of that money went into the coffers of the ruling generals. The junta has tried to blame the KNU for the scams, but there is no basis for this; unlike the other armed Karen groups, the KNU has kept its distance from the business.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tha scam centres accessed the internet via Starlink</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24l5301gg8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Billions of dollars have been lost globally by victims of romance scams</a>, people duped into get-rich-quick crypto schemes and elderly people investing their retirement money into bogus funds, many of which originate from these centres. The darkest side of the industry is felt in South East Asia, where these online fraud schemes are linked to human trafficking, money laundering and extensive human rights abuses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is growing international concern, and co-ordination between law-enforcement agencies, to try to combat this scourge. The US has set up a multi-agency anti-scam task force. China, one of the Myanmar military junta's closest allies, has been pressing it to do more for years because <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq95j1yp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">thousands of Chinese citizens have fallen victim both to online fraud</a> and to being trafficked and held for ransom in the compounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the reports in Myanmar state media showcasing the military's actions in KK Park, it would appear that this pressure is finally working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet its demolitions in KK Park, while spectacular, do not appear to have destroyed the infrastructure for scamming there. And the military operations have focused only on this compound – there are dozens of others. It did raid the scam city of Shwe Kokko, but only entered a few buildings, and to date has demolished only one.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head A damaged building inside KK Park as seen from across the Thai-Myanmar border. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some buildings in KK park looked heavily damaged</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of foreign scam workers have left KK Park and Shwe Kokko, and made their way across the Moei River to Thailand. Many others have scattered to different locations, although transport is difficult and expensive. Just booking a car now costs 5,000 yuan, equivalent to about $700 (£520). The main scam bosses are presumed to have taken their businesses to more remote, less visible parts of Myanmar further south on the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a town called Minletpan, one group of scam workers was trapped last month in two compounds, known as Shunda and Baoili. These have been built right by the river just in the past two years. They are in an area controlled by the DKBA, one of the militias allied to the military junta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 21 November, according to a KNU spokesman, their fighters were engaged in a battle with the army, when they found themselves being shot at from behind by the DKBA in Minletpan. They turned and drove out the DKBA, but then found themselves unexpectedly in control of the two scam centres, and the thousands of foreigners working there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The KNU announced that it wanted to set an example by inviting journalists and international law enforcement agencies to see the captured compounds. It published photographs and documents to expose how the scam business works, rather than destroying the evidence as the military has done in KK Park.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sent hundreds of workers over the river to Thailand, but around 1,000, mainly Chinese citizens, refused to leave, probably because they feared prosecution if they went back to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But aside from a handful of journalists, the international interest in its prize never materialised, and the junta's forces began shelling the area to try to retake the compounds – that's what we could hear from the Thai side. Many of the remaining scam workers have now fled elsewhere in Myanmar, though a few hundred remain camped under flimsy tarpaulins on the river bank, along with hundreds of local people, all hoping to avoid the artillery exchanges.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head Clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dust rises above KK Park as buildings were demolished</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this drama is down to one thing: <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the junta's much criticised plan to hold an election later this month</a>. The civil war ignited by its coup is ravaging the country. The military regime is loathed by most of Myanmar's people, and is treated as a pariah internationally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The generals are looking for an off-ramp which will buy them a semblance of legitimacy, and win over some of their many opponents. They have chosen an election, but one in which the main opposition groups either cannot or will not take part, and where much of the country is in too much turmoil for voting to take place at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the military has made retaking as much territory from insurgents before the election a priority. It is also trying to clean up its image, by its high-profile operation against the scam compounds. This is especially important for its most powerful international ally, China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we were on the border, we saw clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished. Some of the largest structures there were buckled and bent, their windows shattered; the walls of others were being torn down by excavators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the distance many buildings were still intact. Some had tell-tale white squares on their roofs that were almost certainly Starlink satellite dishes, suggesting some scam work might still be going on there.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A warning against scammers is displayed at a Thai-Myanmar border crossing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Drive an hour-and-half south in Thailand, and you reach a quiet border crossing called Wa Le – Wawlay in Burmese. The river is so narrow here it is little more than a stream; you walk over to Myanmar through an iron gate and across a little blue wooden bridge, where you are greeted by the flags of the KNU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while the territory around Wawlay is fiercely contested, with the KNU capturing several military bases earlier this year, the crossing is controlled by the DKBA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the Thai side large signs warn people of the risks of being lured into working for scam centres. Yet just a few metres away a walled compound, topped with razor wire, has been built right next to the river. This is known as Hengsheng 3; we could hear generators running and security guards talking on the other side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were barred windows, and Starlink dishes on the roof. Monitoring groups have identified this and several other new compounds around Wawlay. Many more syndicates have moved even further south to Payathonzu, near the Three Pagodas Pass border crossing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whatever the future of well-known scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko – and it is too soon to judge whether they really are being shut down – the scam business is still thriving in Myanmar.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more about Myanmar's scam compounds</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"
