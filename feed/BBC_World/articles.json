It was always the most likely and, in the absence of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, perhaps the most desirable outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But US President Donald Trump's pivot away from the need for an immediate ceasefire, which he said beforehand he wanted, will have caused profound dismay in Kyiv and around Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's position has long been that a ceasefire can only come in the context of a comprehensive settlement taking account of Russia's interests - and inevitably implies Ukraine's capitulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That's the position that Trump, once again, appears to have endorsed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Not only that, but it's been widely reported that Russia's demands include the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from areas of the eastern Donbas not currently held by Russia, in exchange for a willingness to freeze the lines further south, in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine,\" he wrote on Truth Social, \"is to go directly to a peace agreement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ceasefires, he noted, \"often times do not hold up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This appears to fly in the face of Ukraine's main demand, endorsed by all its European backers: that an unconditional ceasefire has to come first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Crucially, it also buys Russia's Vladimir Putin time on the battlefield, where he is convinced he's winning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If Putin's military objective was to avoid immediate constraints on Russian operations in Ukraine then he appears to have succeeded,\" says Matthew Savill, the director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ian Bond, deputy director of the Centre for European Reform and a former British diplomat, said Moscow's territorial demand was a non-starter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If Trump thinks that Zelensky is going to agree to give up the fortress cities of the Donetsk oblast, just to get Putin to stop making war on him, he's out of his mind,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It shows how little he still understands about the situation and the geography of Ukraine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At their brief press appearance last night, Putin warned Ukraine and the Europeans not to \"throw a wrench\" in the works of the unspecified progress he and Trump had made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that, for Kyiv and its allies, is precisely what Trump has done, undoing the achievements of what they had all hoped was a successful preceding week of frantic diplomacy aimed at influencing the outcome in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a reminder, as if one were needed, of Trump's tendency to echo the views of the last person to have his ear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For a short while this morning, European leaders will have held their breath, waiting to see if their efforts had borne fruit or been cast aside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">True to his word before the summit, Trump got on the phone to Zelensky. The two men spoke for an hour, before being joined by European leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said the call was \"long and substantive\" and that he would travel to Washington on Monday for his first visit since the disastrous Oval Office encounter in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A lot has happened since then, with Kyiv's European allies working assiduously to repair the damage and school Zelensky in the best ways of handling the capricious and volatile occupant of the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I am grateful for the invitation,\" Zelensky posted, adding \"it is important that America's strength has an impact on the situation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in a later post, after Trump's statement on Truth Social, Zelensky adopted a more urgent tone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Killings must stop as soon as possible,\" he said. \"The fire must cease both on the battlefield and in the sky, as well as

It was a rare example of a failed summit coming as a relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the absence of any real developments, attention in Ukraine turned to the presentational aspects of the summit – the \"optics\", in political speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin, the man responsible for the devastating war of aggression against Ukraine, had received the warmest welcome possible in Alaska. American soldiers knelt to literally roll out the red carpet for him. Trump applauded him as he approached and offered a friendly handshake. The two leaders rode together alone in Trump's presidential limousine and Putin could be seen laughing as the car pulled away.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the Russian president, who has been shunned internationally since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the greeting marked the beginning of a remarkable return to the global diplomatic stage and set a tone that would continue throughout the day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Ukraine, it was not a welcome sight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Red carpets and this level of ceremony are normal at international events, but in this case – for an aggressor responsible for the deaths of millions – it should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova, 40, a lawyer in the capital Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Drachova, who woke up and watched the footage over breakfast, said it appeared as though \"the entire event was staged to please Putin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The rational world is behaving irrationally by giving him this welcome,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"It should not have happened,\" said Maria Drachova of the warm welcome for Putin</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Putin's plane had been escorted into the airbase in Alaska by four American fighter jets and as he strolled down the red carpet, talking jovially with Trump, an American B-2 bomber flew overhead flanked by four more jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukrainians who had stayed up late to watch the spectacle were seeing the \"legitimisation of a war criminal at the highest level\", said Oleksandr Kovalenko, a Ukrainian writer and political analyst.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There was no need for this pomp at all,\" Kovalenko said. \"This is a meeting that should have been conducted in a much more restrained way – minimalistic, without this level of respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After the greetings, Trump and Putin sat down in front of a gaggle of reporters at Elmendorf Air Force Base, under a banner that read \"Pursuing Peace\". A question was shouted at Putin: \"Will you you stop killing civilians?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Russian leader appeared to smirk, and gestured to his ear to suggest he couldn't hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Along with the smiles, laughter, and general good will on show, the gesture struck a very sour note in Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands have been killed and wounded in Russia's war of aggression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When I saw what happened I felt crushed,\" said Serhii Orlyk, 50, from the eastern province of Donetsk, which has been largely seized by Russian forces and seen some of the most intense fighting of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I lost my home twice, in Sloviansk and in Donetsk. I lost relatives,\" Orlyk said. \"I understand that to agree on something, there must be protocol, you cannot just slap Putin in the face when he arrives.

He is serving five life sentences plus 40 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Opinion polls have consistently indicated that he remains the most popular Palestinian leader, and that Palestinians would vote for him in a presidential election ahead of the current Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas or Hamas leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He remains a senior figure in the Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA). He was targeted by Israel due to his leading role in the Second Palestinian Intifada or uprising from 2000-05.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The video originally surfaced on messaging groups for Ben Gvir's supporters on Thursday but has now been reposted on his X account.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minister says that having read how \"all sorts of \"senior officials\"\" in the PA did not like what he said, he will \"repeat it again and again without apologising\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinian prisoner rights organisations say that Barghouti has been placed in solitary confinement since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. Last year they accused guards of \"brutally assaulting\" him in his cell which the Israeli prison service denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to the new video, the head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, Abdullah al-Zaghari accused Israel of seeking \"to eliminate him and assassinate the leaders languishing in its prisons\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Barghouti is one of the prisoners whose release Hamas is believed to have sought as part of an exchange deal for the remaining hostages it is holding. However, it is thought very unlikely that Israel would free him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the video, as Ben Gvir speaks, Barghouti – who is fluent in Hebrew – can be seen nodding and trying to break in, but the short clip ends before he does.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His wife, Fadwa, recommended to her husband's followers that only one still be used from the video which she believed showed his strength.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Palestinians widely see Barghouti as the leader who could best unify different political factions and negotiate peace with Israel.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He defended them on Thursday and did not seem willing to back down in the face of the lawsuit threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Donald Trump was a friend of Epstein, but has said they fell out in the early 2000s because the financier poached employees from the spa in Trump's Florida golf club. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A letter from the first lady's lawyers and addressed to an attorney for Hunter Biden demands he retract the claim and apologise, or face legal action for \"over $1bn in damages\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says the first lady has suffered \"overwhelming financial and reputational harm\" because of the claim he repeated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also accuses the youngest Biden son of having a \"vast history of trading on the names of others\", and repeating the claim \"to draw attention to yourself\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">During a wide-ranging interview with filmmaker Andrew Callaghan published earlier this month, Hunter Biden claimed unreleased documents relating to Epstein would \"implicate\" President Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said: \"Epstein introduced Melania to Trump - the connections are so wide and deep.\" The first lady's legal letter notes the claim was partially attributed to Michael Wolff, a journalist who authored a critical biography of the president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a recent interview with US outlet the Daily Beast, Wolff reportedly claimed that the first lady was known to an associate of Epstein and Trump when she met her now-husband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The outlet later retracted the story after receiving a letter from the first lady's attorney that challenged the contents and framing of the story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked during an interview on the YouTube show Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan if he would apologise, Biden said \"not going to happen\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Biden said in the interview posted on Thursday that he did not think \"these threats of a lawsuit add up to anything other than a designed distraction\". But he noted that if the lawsuit was filed, he would be able to collect testimony from both Trumps through depositions and he was \"more than happy to provide them the platform\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is no evidence the Trumps were introduced to each other by Epstein, who took his own life in prison while awaiting trial in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the first lady's legal letter, Hunter Biden is accused of relying on a since-removed article as the basis of his claims, which it describes as \"false and defamatory\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A message on the archived version of the Daily Beast online story reads: \"After this story was published, The Beast received a letter from First Lady Melania Trump's attorney challenging the headline and framing of the article. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"After reviewing the matter, the Beast has taken down the article and apologizes for any confusion or misunderstanding.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Asked about the legal threat, the first lady's lawyer, Alejandro Brito, referred BBC News to a statement issued by her aide, Nick Clemens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It read: \"First Lady Melania Trump's attorneys are actively ensuring immediate retractions and apologies by those who spread malicious, defamatory falsehoods.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A January 2016 profile by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a13529/melania-trump-interview-0216/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Harper's Bazaar</a> reported the first lady met her husband in November 1998, at a party hosted by the founder of a modelling agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Melania Trump, 55, told the publication she declined to give him her phone number because he was \"with a date\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The profile said Trump had recently separated from his second wife, Marla Maples, whom he divorced in 1999. He was previously married to Ivana Trump between 1977 and 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has contacted Hunter Biden's attorney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The legal letter comes after weeks of pressure on the White House to release the so-called Epstein files, previously undisclosed documents relating to the criminal investigation against the convicted paedophile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Before being re-elected, Trump said he would release the records if he returned to office, but the FBI and justice department said in July that no \"incriminating\" client list of Epstein associates existed.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Europeans sought to find a quicker trade route with these areas by sailing west, but in doing so landed on the Americas instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cortés would go on to explore north-western Mexico and the Baja California peninsula.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The document's repatriation comes at a time of political tension between Mexico and the US over tariffs imposed by the Trump administration and illegal migration across the US-Mexico border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the FBI says that, as one of the largest consumers of antiquities, the US had a responsibility to counter the trafficking of artefacts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Dittmer said: \"Pieces like this are considered protected cultural property and represent valuable moments in Mexico's history, so this is something that the Mexicans have in their archives for the purpose of understanding history better.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The FBI said it was determined to locate and repatriate the other pages still missing from the collection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another document signed by Cortés was returned to Mexico by the FBI in 2023.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Yet, new research suggests that mangoes might not be the villain they're sometimes made out to be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two new Indian clinical trials are turning conventional dietary wisdom on its head, suggesting that controlled mango consumption instead of carbohydrates (in the form of bread) may actually improve blood sugar and metabolic health in people with <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfc3pg8/revision/4\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">type 2 diabetes</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreas produces little or no insulin, while in type 2, the body becomes resistant to insulin's effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Type 2 diabetes makes up over 90% of global cases, according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

(A glycemic response is how quickly and how much a food raises blood sugar levels after eating.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Continuous glucose monitoring of people with and without type 2 diabetics over three days showed that, in participants with diabetes, post-meal sugar fluctuations were significantly smaller after eating a mango. This low fluctuation glycemic response could be beneficial to the body in the long run, researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Mangoes are a much-loved fruit and maligned for its possible glucose and weight-elevating effects,\" said Dr Sugandha Kehar, first author of both studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These studies show that within prescribed diets, consumption of mangoes are not detrimental to blood glucose and may even be beneficial.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A second, eight-week randomised trial published in the Journal of Diabetes &amp; Metabolic Disorders - conducted at Delhi's Fortis C-DOC with Indian Council of Medical Research funding - has reinforced the findings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thirty-five adults with type 2 diabetes who replaced their breakfast bread with 250g of mango saw improvements in fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1C test (HbA1c) which measures average blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, weight, waist circumference and HDL cholesterol.

Joshi writes India's mangoes vary by region: northern and eastern varieties like Langra, Dasheri, Chausa and Himsagar are intensely sweet, while southern types offer a subtle sweet-sour flavour. The Alphonso of western India owes its signature taste to a unique balance of sugar and acid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So central is the fruit to Indian life that the calendar year itself often begins with the mango flowering.

Russia now controls rather less territory - down from about 27% in the spring of 2022 to around 20% now. In the east, Russian forces are advancing, but very slowly and at great cost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine says an unconditional ceasefire is needed now. European allies also insist on a halt in fighting. US President Donald Trump says that is what he has been trying to achieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in the run-up to his Alaska summit with Putin,  Trump has talked instead about territorial swaps. That has sent shockwaves across Kyiv and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is not at all clear what land Trump is referring to, or what those swaps could look like, given that all the territory in question legally belongs to Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As of August 2025, the territory of Ukraine looks as follows:</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia would dearly love to expand its control over the entirety of Luhansk and Donetsk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some reports suggest that Putin is demanding that Ukraine hand over the remaining territory it controls in both oblasts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that would mean Kyiv giving up on places which tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have died trying to protect - cities like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, and a fortified line protecting Ukrainian territory to the north and west.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Kyiv, such a concession would be a bitter pill to swallow. For Moscow, whose losses have been even more catastrophic, it would be seen as victory. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zelensky said on Tuesday that Ukraine \"could not\" leave the Donbas as Moscow would use the region as a springboard to attack the rest of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days, Russian forces appear to be pushing hard, and making progress, near the town of Dobropillya. But it's not yet clear whether this marks a significant strategic move or just an effort to show Trump that Moscow has the upper hand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What about Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, captured in 2022? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Here, it's reported, Russia is offering to halt its offensive and freeze the lines.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But would Russia be prepared to give any of it back? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Monday, Trump talked vaguely about \"ocean-front property\" – presumably a reference to some of this shoreline, along the Sea of Azov or Black Sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But this is all part of Putin's strategically vital land bridge connecting Russia to occupied Crimea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's hard to see the Russian leader agreeing to give any of it up. Like Donetsk and Luhansk, Putin regards these places as part of Russia, and illegally annexed them three years ago in four referendums widely regarded as a sham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For Ukraine, and Europe, territorial swaps – at this very early stage of the talks – are a non-starter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A discussion about future borders may eventually come, but only when the war has stopped and Ukraine's security has been guaranteed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But in the court, no amount of expert-like confidence could undo the prosecution's case - a spouse murdered and a motive rooted in suspicion and marital discord.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last month the High Court dismissed Mamta Pathak's appeal and upheld her life sentence for the April 2021 murder of her husband, Neeraj Pathak, a retired physician.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Pathak mounted a spirited, self-argued defence - invoking gaps in the autopsy, the insulation of the house, and even an electrochemical theory - the court found the circumstantial evidence conclusive: she had drugged her husband with sleeping pills and then electrocuted him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In court, Mamta, a mother of two, had peered over a stack of overflowing case files, leafing through them before she grew animated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sir, electric burn marks can't be distinguished as ante-mortem [before death] or post-mortem [after death],\" she argued quoting from a forensics book.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"How did they [doctors] write it was an electric burn mark in post-mortem [report]?\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Microscopically, electrical burns look the same before and after death, making standard examination inconclusive, say experts. A close study of dermal changes may reveal whether a burn was ante- or post-mortem, according to one <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32925207/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">paper</a>. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">The courtroom video of Mamta Pathak arguing her case in the high court went viral</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An impromptu exchange on chemical reactions followed, with the judge probing her on laboratory processes. Mamta spoke about different acids, explaining that distinctions could be made using an electron microscope - something not possible in a post-mortem room. She tried to walk the judge through electron microscopy and different acids. Three women lawyers in the background smiled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta ploughed on - she said she had been studying law in prison for a year. Flipping through her tabbed files with stickers and quoting from forensic medicine books, she pointed to alleged gaps in the investigation - from the unexamined crime scene to the absence of qualified electrical and forensic experts at the scene of the crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our house was insured from 2017 to 2022, and inspections confirmed it was protected against electrical fire,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta told the court that her husband had high blood pressure and heart disease. She stated the actual cause of death was narrowing and \"calcification of his coronary arteries due to old age\". She also suggested he may have slipped and sustained a hematoma, but no CT scan was conducted to confirm this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Neeraj Pathak, 65, had been found dead at the family home on 29 April 2021. The autopsy ruled electrocution as the cause of death. Days later, Mamta had been arrested and charged with murder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Police had seized an 11-meter electric wire with a two-pin plug, and CCTV footage from the couple's house. Six tablets of a sleeping pill were recovered in a strip of 10.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The postmortem report cited cardiorespiratory shock from electrical current at multiple sites as the cause of death, occurring 36 to 72 hours before the autopsy conducted on 1 May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But they didn't find my fingerprints on the strip of tablets,\" Mamta told the judges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But her arguments quickly unravelled, leaving Judges Agarwal and Devnarayan Sinha unconvinced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For nearly four decades, Mamta and Neeraj Pathak had lived a seemingly orderly middle-class life in Chhatarpur - a drought-prone district of Madhya Pradesh known for its farms, granite quarries, and small businesses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She taught chemistry at the local government college; he was the chief medical officer at the district hospital. They raised two sons - one settled abroad, the other, sharing a home with his mother. Neeraj retired voluntarily in 2019 after 39 years as a government doctor and then opened a private clinic at home.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Mamta Pathak taught chemistry at a government college for 36 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The incident happened during the pandemic. Neeraj was showing Covid symptoms and kept to the first floor. Mamta and her son, Nitish, stayed downstairs. Two staircases from the ground floor linked Neeraj's rooms to the open gallery and waiting hall of his private clinic, where half a dozen staff bustled between the lab and the medical store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 97-page judgment stated that Mamta reported finding her husband Neeraj unresponsive in his bed on 29 April, but did not inform a doctor or the police until 1 May. Instead, she took her elder son to Jhansi - over 130km away - without clear reason, according to the driver, and returned the same evening. She claimed ignorance about how he died when she finally alerted the police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beneath this silence lay a troubled marriage. The judges highlighted longstanding marital discord, with the couple living apart and Mamta suspecting her husband of infidelity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the morning of the day he died,, Neeraj had called an associate, alleging that Mamta was \"torturing him,\" locking him in a bathroom, withholding food for days, and causing physical injuries. He also accused her of taking cash, ATM cards, vehicle keys, and bank fixed deposit documents. Pleading for help, Neeraj's son contacted a friend who alerted the police, who then rescued the retired doctor from what was described as \"Mamta's custody\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The couple had even lived apart in recent times, adding weight to the court's doubts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta had told the court she was the \"best mother,\" presenting a birthday card from her children as proof. She also showed photos of herself feeding her husband and snapshots with family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Yet, the judges were unmoved. They noted that such tokens of affection didn't erase motive - after all, a \"doting mother\" can also be a \"suspicious wife,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Fifty minutes into her deposition, after parrying questions and defending herself against the court's doubts, Mamta's composure faltered for the first time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I know one thing… I did not kill him,\" she said, her voice trailing off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At another moment, she confessed, \"I can't take this very much more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trying to ease the tension, Judge Agarwal remarked, \"You must be used to this… you must be taking classes for 50 minutes in college.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Forty minutes, sir. But they are small children,\" Mamta said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Small children in college? But your designation is assistant professor,\" the judge pressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But they are kids, sir,\" she replied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Don't tell us such stories,\" Judge Agarwal interrupted sharply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mamta fought not just as a defendant, but as a teacher turning the courtroom into a chemistry lab - hoping to prove her innocence through science. Yet in the end, the cold facts proved stronger than her lessons.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Buried in this vast terrain is a massive pit, full of what looks like mounds of worthless dirt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But appearances can be deceiving: this pit is home to a million-tonne stockpile containing critical minerals, better known as rare earths, which are crucial for making electric vehicles, wind turbines and defence equipment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And Australia is betting big on this discovery with a billion dollar loan to a mining company to extract these metals - and disrupt a supply chain that China has monopolised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Will the gamble pay off? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's chokehold on rare earths has hit home with US President Donald Trump's trade wars. When Beijing restricted exports, a powerful bargaining chip in tariff negotiations, it sent manufacturers around the world into their war rooms. China, they realised with alarm, had the power to stop their factories. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ford even halted production of its popular Explorer SUV for a week at one of its Chicago plants - a bold move while grappling with Trump's tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, CEO Jim Farley revealed the pause was triggered by a shortage of rare earths, admitting the company was still struggling to secure reliable supply. \"It's day to day,\" Mr Farley told Bloomberg TV.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing has since agreed to let rare earth minerals and magnets flow to the United States, which eased the bottleneck. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But without a US-China trade deal, the fear is that the disruption could return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The West dropped the ball – that's the reality. And China was in for the long run. It saw the benefit and was willing to invest in it,\" says Jacques Eksteen, chair for extractive metallurgy at Curtin University.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Why rare earths matter</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The phrase \"rare earths\" - referring to 17 elements on the periodic table which are lightweight, super strong and resistant to heat, making them useful in small electric motors  - is something of a misnomer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Rare earths are not rare or scarce. Gold is scarce, but it's not a critical material,\" Professor Eksteen explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical, however. Take the average electric vehicle – there might be rare earths-based motors in dozens of components from side mirrors and speakers to windscreen wipers and braking sensors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem is therefore not amount, but the fact \"somewhere in the supply chain you've got one or maybe a few countries controlling that bottleneck\", Professor Eksteen adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the 90s, Europe and France in particular had a prominent rare earths industry. Today, almost all these minerals come from China, which has spent decades mining and refining at scale.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China now accounts for more than half of global rare earth mining, and almost 90% of processing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US sources 80% of its rare earth imports from China, while the European Union relies on China for about 98% of its supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"China has since very deliberately and overtly sought to control the market for the purposes of supporting their downstream manufacturing and defence industries,\" says Dan McGrath, head of rare earths for Iluka Resources, in between driving us around the company's vast Eneabba site. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Mr McGrath, and Iluka, are hoping to make a dent in that control - even if it wasn't necessarily in the company's original plan. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Iluka's 1mn tonne stockpile is worth more than $650m</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For decades, Iluka has been mining zircon in Australia - a key ingredient in ceramics, and titanium dioxide used in the pigmentation of paint, plastics and paper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It just so happens the byproducts of these mineral sands include dysprosium and terbium - some of the most sought-after rare earths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years, Iluka has built up the stockpile, and is now worth more than $650m (£440m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This was the easy part, however. The processing or refining is another matter altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're chemically very similar so to try and separate them requires a huge number of stages,\" Professor Eksteen explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Also, you've got residues and wastes that you have to deal with out of this industry, and that's problematic. They often produce radioactive materials. It comes at a cost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And that is one of the reasons the Australian government is loaning Iluka A$1.65bn ($1bn; £798m) to build a refinery to meet demand for rare earths which Iluka sees growing by 50-170% by the end of the decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We expect to be able to supply a significant proportion of Western demand for rare earths by 2030. Our customers recognise that having an independent, secure and sustainable supply chain outside of China is fundamental for the continuity of their business,\" says Mr McGrath.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This refinery and Iluka's commitment to the rare earth business is an alternative to China.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Australian resources minister Madeliene King sees investment in rare earths as a strategic decision</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the refinery will take another two years to build and come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Without the strategic partnership we have with the Australian government, a rare earths project would not be economically viable,\" Mr McGrath says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">A strategic necessity</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">China's recent willingness to turn supply of rare earths on and off has spurred trading partners to diversify their suppliers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Iluka says because automakers for example plan their production years in advance, it is already fielding requests for when its refinery does come online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Rare earths are critical to the green transition, electric vehicles, and defence technologies – making their control a pressing national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The open international market in critical minerals and rare earths is a mirage. It doesn't exist. And the reason it doesn't exist is because there is one supplier of these materials and they have the wherewithal to change where the market goes, whether that be in pricing or supply,\" Australia's resources minister Madeleine King says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Canberra sees government intervention as necessary to provide an alternative supply, and help the world rely less on China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can either sit back and do nothing about that... or we can step up to take on the responsibility to develop a rare earths industry here that competes with that market,\" Ms King adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there is something that Australia will have to contend with as it invests and works to expand a rare earths industry – pollution.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250814-092707-b0ec5bc3fc-web-2.27.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7018/live/53a393c0-7755-11f0-8071-1788c7e8ae0e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Labourers work at the site of a rare earth metals mine at Nancheng county, Jiangxi province\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Critics say China's environmental protections and regulations are weak</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In China, environmental damage from years of processing rare earths has led to chemicals and radioactive waste seeping into waterways - cities and people bearing the scars of decades of poor regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With rare earths, it's not so much about the mining footprint, rather the processing that is a dirty business – because it involves extraction, leaching, thermal cracking and refining which produce radioactive components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think there is no metal industry that is completely clean... unfortunately, it's a matter of picking your poison sometimes,\" Professor Eksteen says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"In Australia, we've got mechanisms to handle that.

No ceasefire. Nothing tangible to report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president said that he and Vladimir Putin made \"some great progress\", but with little details about what that might be, it's left to the world's imagination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We didn't get there,\" he later said, before exiting the room without taking any questions from the hundreds of gathered reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump travelled a long way only to produce such vague statements, even if America's European allies and Ukrainian officials may be relieved he did not offer unilateral concessions or agreements that could have undermined future negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For the man who likes to tout himself as a peacemaker and a dealmaker, it appears that Trump will leave Alaska with neither. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There are also no indications that a future summit that includes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is forthcoming, Putin's \"next time in Moscow\" quip about their next meeting notwithstanding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Trump had less at stake during these negotiations than Ukraine or Russia, it still will put a dent in his domestic and international prestige after earlier promises that this meeting had only a 25% chance of failure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What's more, the president had to suffer the apparent indignity of standing silent as Putin started off the press-conference-that-wasn't with extensive opening remarks. It was a marked difference than the normal routine in the Oval Office, when the US president typically holds court while his foreign counterpart looks on without comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Alaska is American territory, Putin seemed more at home in what his officials like to note was once \"Russian America\" before its 19th Century sale to the US. That may eat at the American president over the coming days, as will press coverage that will present this summit as a flop. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The big question now - one reporters were unable to ask on Friday - is whether Trump will decide to impose his much-threatened new sanctions on Russia as punishment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The president partially addressed that in the friendly confines of a Fox News interview before flying out, saying that he would consider such a move \"maybe in two weeks, three weeks\".

Three-and-a-half years of Western efforts have failed to make him change his mind, and that now includes the Alaska summit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The uncertainty that persists after the meeting is also worrying. What happens next? Will Russia's attacks continue unabated?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The past few months have seen a succession of Western deadlines that came and went without consequences, and threats that were never carried out. Ukrainians see this as an invitation for Putin to continue his attacks. They may see the apparent lack of progress achieved Anchorage in the same light.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
