The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters after their meeting, Trump said a deal on Donbas remained \"unresolved, but it's getting a lot closer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the Kremlin again said Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the part of the region that Kyiv still controls. Ukraine has insisted the area could become a free economic zone policed by its forces - but Zelensky has underlined that any talks on this should include the Ukrainian people, Reuters reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president has repeatedly changed his own position on Ukraine's lost territories, and in September stunned observers by suggesting that Ukraine might be able to take it back.

He emerges from a mosque in the heart of Gaziantep in south-east Turkey - not far from the Syrian border - wearing a black T-shirt with \"Syria\" written on the front.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family fled his homeland when he was five years old, but he is planning to go back in a year or two at most.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am impatient to get there,\" he tells me. \"I am trying to save money first, because wages in Syria are low.\" Still, he insists the future will be better there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Syria will be rebuilt and it will be like gold,\" he says.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If he goes back, he will be following in the footsteps of more than half a million Syrians who have left Turkey since the ousting of Syria's long-time dictator, Bashar al-Assad, in December 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many had been here since 2011, when civil war began devouring their country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years that followed, Turkey became a safe haven, taking in more Syrians than any other country. The number reached 3.5 million at its peak, causing political tension and - on occasion - xenophobic attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officially, no Syrian will be forced to go, but some feel they are being pushed - by bureaucratic changes, and by a waning welcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Civil society organisations \"are getting the message from the authorities that it's time to go\", says a Syrian woman who did not want to be named. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a lot of good Turkish friends. Even they and my neighbours have asked why I am still here. Of course we will go back, but in an organised way.

We meet under a winter sun by the stone walls of a castle, which has towered over Gaziantep since the Byzantine era. Her hometown, Aleppo, is less than two hours' drive away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says going back is a constant topic of conversation in the Syrian community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every day, every hour, we speak about this point,\" says Aya, whose family were lawyers and teachers back home, but had to start again in Turkey, baking and hairdressing to earn a living.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are talking about how we can return, and when, and what we can do. But there are many challenges, to be honest. Many families have children who were born here and can't even speak Arabic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there is the level of destruction in new Syria - where war has done its worst - and where the interim president, Ahmed Al Sharaa, is a former senior leader of Al Qaeda who has worked to reinvent his image.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aya saw the ruins of Aleppo for herself when she went back to visit. Her family home is still standing but now occupied by someone else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a big decision to go back to Syria,\" she says, \"especially for people with elderly relatives. I have my grandmother and my disabled sister. We need the basics like electricity and water and jobs to survive there.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, she says, her family can't survive in Syria, but they will return in time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We believe that day will come,\" she says, with a broad smile. \"It will take some years [to rebuild].

The father - who does not want to be named - runs an aid organisation helping his fellow countrymen. Over glasses of tea and helpings of baklava, I ask if he and his family would move back. His response is swift and adamant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, not for me and for my family,\" he says. \"And the same goes for my organisation. We have projects inside Syria, and we hope to extend that activity. But my family and my organisation will stay here in Turkey.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why, he lists problems with the economy, security, education and the health system. Syria's interim government \"hasn't any experience to deal with the situation\", he tells me. \"Some ask us to give them a chance, but one year has passed and the indications are not good.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He too has visited the new Syria, and, like Aya, was not reassured. \"The security situation is very bad,\" he says. \"Every day there are killings. Regardless of who the victims are, they have souls.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His voice softens when he speaks of his 80-year-old father in Damascus, who hasn't seen his grandsons for 12 years, and may never see them again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, he and his family can remain in Turkey, but he's already making contingency plans in case government policy changes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Plan A is that we will stay here in Turkey,\" he says. \"If we cannot, I'm thinking about plan B, C and even D. I am an engineer, always planning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of those plans involve a return to Syria.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If going home is hard, staying in Turkey isn't easy either.  Syrians have \"temporary protection\" that comes with restrictions. They are not supposed to leave the cities where they are first registered.  Work permits are hard to get, and many are in low paid jobs, living on the margins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who backed the uprising against Assad - has insisted that no Syrian will be driven out, but refugee advocates say there are growing pressures beneath the surface.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They point to the ending of free medical care for Syrians from January, and new government regulations which make it more expensive to hire them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These new elements cast a shadow over how voluntary returns are,\" says Metin Corabatir, who heads an independent Turkish research centre on asylum and migration, IGAM.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he says presidential and parliamentary elections – due by 2028 – may be another threat for Syrians here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Normally President Erdogan is their main protector,\" Mr Corabatir tells me. \"He says they can stay as long as they want. And he repeated this after the regime changed. But if there is an election, and a political gain for the AKP [ruling party] to make, there might be some policy changes.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0993/live/65cfbaf0-dc37-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Syrian refugees residing in Turkey return to their homeland through the Cilvegözü Border Gate in Hatay on 11 December 2024.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">More than half a million Syrians have left Turkey since the ousting of Assad</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fresh elections could revive the xenophobic rhetoric that featured in the last polls, he warns. \"Those feelings went to sleep,\" he says, \"but I am quite sure the infrastructure of this xenophobic attitude is still alive.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold grey morning at a border crossing an hour's drive from Gaziantep the hills of Syria are visible, a short distance away.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mahmud Sattouf and his wife Suad Helal are heading to their homeland – this time just for a visit.

I watched the Cold War reach its height, then simply evaporate. But I've never seen a year quite as worrying as 2025 has been - not just because several major conflicts are raging but because it is becoming clear that one of them has geopolitical implications of unparalleled importance.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the current conflict in his country could escalate into a world war. After nearly 60 years of observing conflict, I've got a nasty feeling he's right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato governments are on high alert for any signs that Russia is cutting the undersea cables that carry the electronic traffic that keeps Western society going.

Their hackers develop ways of putting ministries, emergency services and huge corporations out of operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities in the west are certain Russia's secret services murder and attempt to murder dissidents who have taken refuge in the West.

There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this.

Some conflicts, such as Vietnam, the first Gulf War, and the war in Kosovo, did occasionally look as though they might tip over into something much worse, but they never did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The great powers were too nervous about the dangers that a localised, conventional war might turn into a nuclear one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" the British Gen Sir Mike Jackson reportedly shouted over his radio in Kosovo in 1999, when his Nato superior ordered British and French forces to seize an airfield in Pristina after the Russian troops had got there first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the coming year, 2026, though, Russia, noting President Trump's apparent lack of interest in Europe, seems ready and willing to push for much greater dominance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a later televised event he said: \"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a statement during a press conference\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But already Russia, a major world power, has invaded an independent European country, resulting in huge numbers of civilian and also military deaths.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his involvement in this, something Russia has always denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia says it invaded in order to protect itself against Nato encroachment, but President Putin has indicated another motive:  the desire to restore Russia's regional sphere of influence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">An increasingly different America</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is gratefully aware that this last year, 2025, has seen something most Western countries had regarded as unthinkable: the possibility that an American president might turn his back on the strategic system which has been in force ever since World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not only is Washington now uncertain it wants to protect Europe, it disapproves of the direction it believes Europe is heading in. The Trump administration's new national security strategy report claims Europe now faces the \"stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin welcomed the report, saying it is consistent with Russia's own vision. You bet it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inside Russia, Putin has silenced most internal opposition to himself and to the Ukraine war, according to the UN special rapporteur focusing on human rights in Russia.

Now, very much as in the 1920s and 30s, it wants to concentrate on its own national interests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if President Trump loses a lot of his political strength at next year's mid-term elections, he may have shifted the dial so far towards isolationism that even a more Nato-minded American president in 2028 might find it hard to come to Europe's aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Don't think Vladimir Putin hasn't noticed that.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The risk of escalation</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coming year, 2026, does look as though it'll be important.

Europe will have to take over a far greater share of keeping Ukraine going, but if the United States turns its back on Ukraine, as it sometimes threatens to do, that will be a colossal burden.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1c7c/live/35c133f0-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images Rescue workers search for people under rubble of an apartment building destroyed by a Russian missile strike in Kyiv\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">If the United States turns its back on Ukraine, that will be a colossal burden for Europe</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But could the war turn into a nuclear confrontation?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We know President Putin is a gambler; a more careful leader would have shied away from invading Ukraine in February 2022. His henchmen make bloodcurdling threats about wiping the UK and other European countries off the map with Russia's vaunted new weapons, but he's usually much more restrained himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Americans are still active members of Nato, the risk that they could respond with a devastating nuclear attack of their own is still too great. For now.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">China's global role</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for China, President Xi Jinping has made few outright threats against the self-governed island of Taiwan recently. But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool  (L-R) Russia's President Vladimir Putin walks with China's President Xi Jinping and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance.  I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">John Simpson has reported on China many times over the years - pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Altogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish.  It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the process has already started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credits:-afp-/-getty-images\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credits: AFP / Getty Images</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

However, few other countries have been willing to take part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netanyahu is also expected to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is seen as supportive of the positions of the Israeli government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Israeli media reported that there may be an attempt by the prime minister to rediscuss Israel annexing the occupied West Bank - something President Trump has spoken against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli ministers have recently described their expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank as a de facto annexation of the territory aimed at burying the possibility of an independent Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the settlements and annexation are illegal under international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also expected that Netanyahu may use his meeting with Trump on Monday to seek US permission for further military strikes on Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli government is said to believe Iran is rearming its missile capabilities after their 12-day war this summer, which saw Iran's nuclear facilities bombed by both Israeli and US fighter jets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian president said this weekend that his country was in \"all-out war\" with Israel, the US and Europe. \"They don't want our country to remain stable,\" Masoud Pezeshkian said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">British-Egyptian democracy activist Alaa Abd El Fattah has apologised for several of his old tweets that have resurfaced, as calls grow for him to be deported from the UK days after he arrived following his release from an Egyptian jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tory and Reform UK leaders say the home secretary should consider whether Abd El Fattah, a dual national, can be removed after social media messages showed him calling for Zionists and police to be killed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thetimes.com/uk/politics/article/alaa-abd-el-fattah-egypt-activist-citizenship-lsn35tqhr?t=1766958039719\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Times reports some senior Labour MPs are also calling for his citizenship</a> to be removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After reviewing the historic posts, Abd El Fattah said: \"I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"I am shaken that, just as I am being reunited with my family for the first time in 12 years, several historic tweets of mine have been republished and used to question and attack my integrity and values, escalating to calls for the revocation of my citizenship.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abd El Fattah said he took allegations of antisemitism \"very seriously\" while arguing some of the posts had been \"completely twisted out of their meaning\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer has been criticised for saying he was \"delighted\" by Abd El Fattah's arrival in the UK on Friday, three months after he was freed from prison in Egypt, but it is understood he was unaware of the historical messages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage both said Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood should look at whether Abd El Fattah's citizenship could be revoked to enable his swift removal from the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farage said in a letter to Mahmood: \"It should go without saying that anyone who possesses racist and anti-British views such as those of Mr el-Fattah should not be allowed into the UK.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Foreign Office said it had been \"a long-standing priority under successive governments\" to work for Abd El Fattah's release and see him reunited with his family in the UK, but condemned his posts as  \"abhorrent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 44-year-old was convicted in 2021 of \"spreading fake news\" in Egypt for sharing a Facebook post about torture in the country following a trial that human rights groups said was grossly unfair. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was granted citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother - when the Conservatives were in power and Dame Priti Patel was home secretary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shadow home secretary Chris Philp - who was an immigration minister under Patel but left the role in September 2021 before citizenship was granted - told the BBC he did not know of these details at the time. He added he was now clear in his mind that \"this man should have his citizenship revoked\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no excuse for what he wrote,\" Philp told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7533/live/f92d21f0-e495-11f0-9890-3187c4f9b06f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"PA Media Shadow home secretary Chris Philp wears a blue suit and tie.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">PA Media</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one resurfaced tweet, from 2012, Abd El Fattah appears to say: \"I am a racist, I don't like white people\". In another, he says he considers \"killing any colonialists and specially Zionists heroic, we need to kill more of them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is also accused of saying police do not have rights and \"we should kill them all\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no excuse for that kind of language,\" Philp said on Monday. \"People who express that kind of hatred, that kind of anti-white racism, that kind of extremism who seek to incite violence, have no place in the United Kingdom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Appearing on the same programme, Dame Emily Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, accused Philp of \"throwing ideas around that were just not based in law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The bottom and top of it is that he [Abd El Fattah] is a British citizen,\" she told Today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was entitled to British citizenship, he claimed it so he is a British citizen.

This will not be quite enough to deliver enough seats for Kurti to govern without coalition partners. But he should not find it difficult to find support among the MPs from the ethnic minority parties who are guaranteed 20 of the 120 seats in the National Assembly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is the fourth successive victory in parliamentary elections for Vetevendosje. The result is vindication after the opposition parties blocked his attempts to form a government following the previous polls on February 9.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kurti claimed it was \"the greatest victory in the history of the country\" – and said he expected opposition parties to cooperate, rather than frustrate, this time around.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arben Gashi, of the third-placed Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), indicated that could be possible. \"When voters speak, the result cannot be ignored,\" he posted on social media. \"Reflection and responsible action are required,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is plenty at stake. Kosovo has missed out on hundreds of millions of euros' worth of European Union funds because of the lack of a functioning government. Kurti also cited potential agreements with the World Bank which would bring the total sum to more than €1bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repairing relations with Kosovo's strongest international supporters, the EU and the US, should also be on the agenda. Kurti angered Brussels and Washington by repeatedly targeting institutions serving Kosovo's Serb minority – from post offices to healthcare facilities. This increased tensions in majority-Serb north Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU has finally agreed to remove the punitive measures it imposed in 2023. But it will be looking for Kurti to take a pragmatic approach to the long-stalled normalisation dialogue with Serbia, rather than stick to his usual dogmatic line. Given his frosty relations with Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, this may be a vain hope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that Kosovo's voters have resoundingly endorsed such a polarising figure reflects their jaundiced view of the alternatives. Parties connected to the Kosovo Liberation Army dominated government in the decade following 2008's unilateral declaration of independence – but failed to deliver on their promises of prosperity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One analyst, Artan Muhaxhiri, noted Vetevendosje's \"countless violations of the constitution, the lack of economic development and the breakdown of relations with allies\" over its years in power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he concluded that \"despite all the shortcomings, citizens have considered the opposition to be more harmful\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hiccups are caused by the involuntary spasming of the diaphragm, typically as a result of an irritated phrenic nerve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His doctors later confirmed they had treated the right phrenic nerve and had scheduled to work on the left nerve on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once discharged from hospital, the former president will return to a cell in the federal police headquarters to continue serving his sentence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bolsonaro was found guilty of the coup plot in September.

Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.</p></div></div></body></html>"

even before the US air strikes on the Islamist militants who have made this area their base on Christmas night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The heavily armed jihadists, who dress in camouflage and wear vibrant turbans, have lived in camps in Tangaza, a remote area of Sokoto state near the border with Niger, for several years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They belong to a group called Lakurawa and hail from areas north of Nigeria in the Sahel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals in Tangaza, a community made up of mainly moderate Muslims, believe they come from Niger and Mali - and are terrified of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently, both US and Nigerian authorities have said the militants are affiliated to Islamic State (IS) groups in the Sahel - though IS has not linked itself to any of the group's activities or announced ties to Lakurawa as it has done with other groups in the region that it backs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC visited Nukuru, one of several remote villages in Tangaza around 10km (six miles) from where the US missiles struck, most people were deeply suspicious and did not want to talk about Lakurawa - fearing reprisal if they spoke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was only after assurances that their identities would be kept anonymous that some men agreed to be interviewed, speaking in hushed tones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We had travelled into the dangerous area, about 12km from the Niger border, on Saturday under police escort and with extra security personnel for protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police do not usually venture into this region as they say they do not have enough fire power to confront the militants should they come under attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our team was not able to reach the site of the strikes because of ongoing security risks - and was advised not to stay too long in the area so as not to allow the militants time to plant land mines along our exit route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A farmer, who lives not far from Nukuru, said shortly after the strikes on Thursday night, some fleeing militants converged on his community.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2600/live/b9b12590-e426-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gift Ufuoma/BBC A police 4x4 truck with two officers on the back and acting as a security escort drives along a tarmac road lined with trees in north-western Nigeria.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gift Ufuoma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The police provided a security escort from Sokoto city to the remote village of Nukuru -

They are agile and use motorbikes to move quickly across the region's rough and rugged terrain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not hard to see how the group has been able to gain a foothold here as there is very little sign of a government presence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no visible schools, hospitals or paved roads. Much of the terrain can only be reached using vehicles capable of navigating rough desert paths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Nukuru, the villagers' main means of transport appeared to be donkeys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said that by day the Lakurawa militants come into the community - having established themselves as the de facto governing authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The farmers and villagers have no option but to agree to their terms and taxes as the Islamists are well-armed. If they do not comply, they are attacked and their livestock is stolen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The farmer who spoke to the BBC said the fighters passed through his hamlet most days on their way to other communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We knew they are Lakurawa because of their dressing,\" he said, describing their camouflage uniforms and their turbans usually worn by men in desert areas of Mali and Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amongst themselves the militants spoke Fulfude - the language of the Fulani ethnic group spoken in many West African countries - but communicated with the locals in Hausa, the lingua franca of the region, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At night, the fighters go back to their isolated camps, which are on higher ground and give them a good vantage point over the plains. No women or families are thought to be living in these makeshift bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lakurawa initially arrived in the largely Muslim states of Sokoto and Kebbi, the group presented itself as a religious force that wanted to help a vulnerable community in an insecure region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria faces an array of complex security issues. For the past 15 years, it has been the north-east of the country that has suffered from a devastating Islamist insurgency at the hands of jihadist groups such as Boko Haram.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more recently swathes of the country's north-west have been terrorised by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, who make money by kidnapping and holding people for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lakurawa moved into communities along the Niger-Nigeria border, it prompted the bandits to move elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At first, this is thought to have ingratiated the group with some locals - but this was short-lived. People in Tangaza area say the religious militants became heavy-handed, and began enforcing harsh rules and spreading fear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A resident of Nukuru spoke about the hard-line, strict Muslim ideology the militants have imposed - including banning things they deem to be against Islamic Sharia law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We cannot live freely,\" the young man told the BBC. \"You cannot even play music on your phone - they will not only confiscate it, but also punish you.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music is seen as distracting from religious duties or encouraging of immoral behaviour by some highly conservative Muslim sects - and offenders have been flogged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Lakurawa militants are thought to have married into border communities - keeping their families away from the camps - and recruited young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of these recruits are used as informants, while others help the militants trade or gather supplies from residents.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c84/live/56df5620-e427-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Gift Ufuoma/BBC Around 15 clay granaries in Nukuru \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Gift Ufuoma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">These granaries are used to store crops harvested after the rainy season</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strikes on Thursday were the second time the group has been targeted in operations on a Christmas Day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last Christmas, Nigeria's military launched an attack against them near Gidan Sama and Rumtuwa, several kilometres from Nukuru.

Behind us, the vast metropolis of Beijing has yet to wake. As we wait, we hear only our own breath.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And then, as the sky starts to lighten ahead of sunrise, we hear footsteps. The poachers are here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Slim and stealthy, Silva heads out first. We eventually follow with our cameras.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Slowly, we tread through a line of trees, into a small clearing. We only spot the bird net when it is a few inches from our faces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Each year, tens of thousands of birds are caught in nets across China for the pet trade, or for meat. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pandemic and a property crisis have turned the economy sluggish - so catching and selling songbirds on the black market is a low-cost and often low-risk way of making a large profit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A pretty songbird, such as a Siberian rubythroat, can often sell for nearly 2,000 yuan (£210; $280), which is more than many farmers earn in a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I want to protect them on this Earth controlled by humans,\" Silva says. Birds, for him, are a passion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I often dream. And in my dreams, I'm always flying.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Trapped</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the skies above us, billions of birds, many so small that they can fit in the palm of your hand, are migrating south for winter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have taken advantage of the long summer days in Siberia, or Mongolia, feasting on bugs and berries. As the year comes to a close and icy winds bring the first frosts of winter, they are flying to warmer places to nest and feed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was back in October, when flying through China is the equivalent of rush hour for migratory birds heading to Australia, New Zealand or southern Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is home to 1500-plus bird species, which is about 13% of the global population - more than 800 of those are migratory birds. Four of the nine major routes they follow intersect in China. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are long, often perilous journeys, where the birds navigate through storms and evade predators, while looking for the ideal spot to spend the night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The patch of grassland where we were, on the outskirts of the Chinese capital, is an oasis for small birds - any further and the city skies offer few options to rest among towering rows of concrete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is also an oasis for the poachers and their \"mist nets\", so thin you can barely see them. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch the moment BBC stumbles upon bird poachers in Beijing</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The one we nearly walked into was stretched across half the length of the field and propped up with bamboo poles. In the middle, a small finch was desperately trying to free his legs, but the more it moved, the more its claws became tangled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a meadow pipit, a protected bird in China, and an important \"indicator species\" - that means if its numbers are thriving, so is its environment.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The poacher spotted us and started to run. From a small pouch on his hip, he threw around half a dozen small birds into the air before sprinting deeper into the shrubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our cameras caught the moment he was stopped by Silva whose years of experience have taught him how to detain poachers while he calls the police. He stops the poacher from leaving, simply by continuing to block his path.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the beginning I had no experience and at that time I was quite afraid,\" he later says. \"But if you really want to do something, those fears will all be forgotten.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police arrived about 40 minutes later to arrest the poacher.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Hunting the hunters </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva, who in his 30s, does this work for free using his own savings. He has given up on many nights of sleep to set songbirds free, and he has spent the last 10 years persuading the police in Beijing to take this crime seriously. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Back in 2015, no-one cared,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he recruited volunteers who did care and launched a group called the Beijing Migratory Bird Squad. He held public meetings and invited the heads of the local police and forestry bureau. These small and persistent acts of persuasion appear to have worked. The police discovered that catching poachers also led to tracking down other kinds of criminal activity in Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We found our goals were partially aligned,\" Silva says, adding the caveat that enforcement is still patchy. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Silva Gu has spent the last decade fighting to protect and free rare songbirds</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva's love of birds started in childhood. He grew up in the 1990s in a very different Beijing - grand and imposing, but not the capital of an economic giant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He remembers roaming through the grasslands on the city's edges where he found birds, frogs and snakes. \"But starting from the 2000s, everything changed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's booming economy brought millions of rural workers to cities as they sought jobs in factories or in construction. This rapid urbanisation meant grasslands were seen as empty places to build,<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>not sanctuaries<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>to conserve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The change stunned Silva. The grasslands began to shrink, as did the habitats they supported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I decided back then to work in conservation and I took this path,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Silva chasing the poacher in the grassland outside Beijing</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has not been an easy life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of Beijing's biggest bird dealers found out he was being investigated by Silva and retaliated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He gathered several of his accomplices who surrounded me and beat me up,\" Silva recalls. He says he went to the police but those responsible were not brought to justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also lost his army of volunteers over the years. This work requires stealth and sleepless nights to stalk poachers in the dark. Silva says few people are willing to take on the difficult - and sometimes dangerous - job. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do this full-time,\" he says. \"I made it a project because if you want to solve this big problem, you must devote yourself wholeheartedly. You can't do it part-time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says fundraising pays for some of the costs - more than 100,000 yuan, $14,000 a year - but donations have dipped because of the slowing economy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he has found new ways to hunt the hunters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He studies satellite imagery to find the paths worn away by the poachers through large fields and grasslands. He maps those against the bird's migratory routes and looks for areas where they may stop for the night. The satellite images can even show lines of net traps which can catch hundreds of small birds at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's what the mist nets do. They trap a variety of small birds even if the poachers are after prized versions, like the Siberian rubythroat.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Catching and selling protected songbirds is a profitable business in China</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Siberian rubythroats and bluethroats sell for a high price,\" Silva says. \"In big cities like Beijing and Tianjin, those who want to keep birds are now quite wealthy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although there are wildlife laws in place, Silva reckons the fines to punish the crime do not outweigh the financial benefits of catching and selling songbirds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owning a pet bird was - and for some generations in China, still is - a status symbol. This dates back to the Qing dynasty, which ruled China from the mid-17th to early 20th Century. Nobles and elites would build ornate bamboo cages for their birds to display their elegance and wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a tradition that continues mainly among retired men in their 60s or 70s. Silva says older Chinese people don't realise they are committing a wildlife crime, or understand that so many more birds had to die in a trap so they could buy a caged bird.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This generation didn't even have enough to eat growing up. Now with a little money, they have inherited the habit and custom of caging birds,\" he says. \"China developed so fast, there was no time to educate people about ecology and once adults values are formed, they're really hard to change. Maybe they can't be changed in a lifetime.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva feels alone in this fight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sometimes, I am so tired. I want to find someone, maybe a group of people and we could combine our strength - but right now there is no-one.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Busted</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a long low wall alongside the Liangshui river in Beijing, a trader has several small cages with tiny twittering birds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another man stands outside the nearby vegetable market holding a bird cage shrouded in a black veil. He tells passers-by quietly that his songbird is rare, worth nearly 1900 yuan, or about $270.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a glimpse of an old Beijing where small unofficial traders have created their own market. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">An old-school market in Beijing, selling everything from crickets to caged birds</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The path by the river stretches for several miles and on a sunny weekday morning, there were shoppers browsing everything from vintage jewellery to false teeth, all laid out at makeshift stalls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We were told we would be able to buy a wild songbird in a small park just off the path. It was easy to find. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Music was blasting from a speaker under the low trees where a troop of elderly ladies were choreographing a fan dance routine. Nearby several men, all over 50, had gathered with bird cages - some had two or three in their hands. Most were covered in dark cloth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But today there would be no sales because the police had arrived. They were questioning the bird owners and taking names. Defiant, one man said he was taking his caged bird for a walk. This does happen in many Beijing parks, where songbird owners gather with their caged pets to chat and compare notes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This police visit was part of a wider campaign by the Ministry of Public Security that was announced earlier in the year.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/849e/live/de69a4c0-e228-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Qu Mingbin via Getty Images A Siberian Rubythroat stands on a branch in the Jfo Mountain National Nature Reserve in Chongqing, China, on Oct. 10, 2021.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Qu Mingbin via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A Siberian rubythroat can fetch more than $250 on the black market</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wildlife trade is big business. Interpol estimates the illegal portion of the trade to be worth nearly $20bn and, according to Animal Survival group, China is the largest consumer of wildlife products, both illegal and legal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials in Beijing have repeatedly denied accusations that the Covid-19 pandemic originated through animal-to-human transmission at a wet market in Wuhan, where wildlife was also being sold. Conservation groups have been pressuring the Chinese government to ban trade in wildlife.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year, Chinese state media described the protection of wild birds as crucial for safeguarding ecosystems vital to human survival. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This shift in authorities' attitudes is also why Silva has had success working with the police.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">It's mostly older men who still keep caged birds - in the cage is a Chinese bulbul, also a songbird</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in the field outside Beijing, Silva managed to keep the poacher at arm's length until the police arrived. The man appeared to be in his 50s and was wearing old construction overalls. Don't move, Silva warned him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The poacher offerered to kneel and apologise, telling Silva that he only came to the field to look at birds. But Silva grabbed his phone, where he found photos and videos of dozens of caged birds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, when Silva and the police searched his home, they found them all still there, waiting to be sold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the wildlife poaching rings in China are much bigger. In Dalian earlier this year, the police arrested 13 suspects, and seized more than 12,000 yellow-breasted buntings, a wild bird with the highest protection level in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Silva worries that despite the renewed efforts to catch poachers, they face few penalties. But he is also encouraged. He has rescued more than 20,000 birds on site for the past 10 years and disrupted the nets of countless poachers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there's hope,\" he says, pinning his on a generational change - when more young people will understand and appreciate China's rare songbirds and the need to protect them.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until then, he says, he will keep at it himself: \"This is my ideal. If you have this ideal, you must persist. You can't not.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And so each night during the annual migration, he will patrol the fields of Beijing in the hope that he can bring back the dulcet tones of songbirds to the city's skies -  he wants his city to sound like it did in his childhood.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Some of these were leaked to the public before the trial – it is not clear who released them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one particularly disturbing recording, Diiriye can be heard saying: \"I'm enjoying your pain.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A post-mortem examination of Saabirin's body revealed multiple injuries and deep stab wounds consistent with prolonged violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As details of the police investigation emerged, public anger grew.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/051f/live/5ed41490-dcf9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Abdiqaadir Washington A tarmac road is in the foreground strewn with wooden sticks and stones as a result of a protest.

Some kind of compensation is usually agreed but as this process prioritises peace over justice for the victim, and the voices of women and children are not often heard, there is a feeling that some crimes are not being addressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Child abuse in Somalia is often hidden within households, and extended families are traditionally viewed as safe and private spaces – where the state should not interfere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diiriye's trial and other related hearings were broadcast live on social media to ensure public trust in the justice system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regional police commander Mohamud Abdihakim said the verdict marked an important moment in the pursuit of justice for the murdered teenager.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The perpetrator is now only awaiting the implementation of the death sentence.

The ministry also said that the charter's restriction on marriage before the age of 18 contradicted Sharia, which allows marriage when a girl reaches puberty – though in practice in Somalia the minimum age has been 15.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fadumo Ahmed, a women's and child's rights activist, argued that enforcement of similar measures that already existed in Somalia remained weak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police lack the capacity to deal with cases along with social services. Cases often get interfered with by clan elders, which undermines the justice system and victims' voices are not heard, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that children were often unaware that they could speak out and many schools were not teaching them that they could report abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In many similar cases [to Saabirin's], both sides of the family reach a behind-the-door agreement and then inform the government that the matter has been resolved,\" Ms Ahmed said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shukri Ahmed Hussein, the coordinator for Puntland's ministry of women's development and family affairs for the region that includes Galkayo, denies that the authorities are failing in their responsibility to protect children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC, she pointed out programmes to help youths who at one time had been recruited into armed groups, as well as efforts to protect street children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She did however admit that in cases like the one involving Saabirin, it is sometimes difficult to intervene. She acknowledged that more should be done to increase awareness that people can speak out if they suspect that a child might not be safe.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every child in Puntland has the right to be removed from any household in which they do not feel safe,\" Ms Hussein said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Saabirin's life was cut tragically short, her death is now forcing overdue conversations about child safety in Somalia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as the local community reflects on the verdict, some are unsure if the justice will be served in the long run.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is nothing to celebrate yet, we still need clarity,\" one of the young protesters, Abdikadir Ali, said in a social media message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't want justice in words, we want to see it with our own eyes.

But in the 25 years Vladimir Putin has been in power, Russia's rich and powerful - known as oligarchs - have lost almost all their political influence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this is good news for the Russian president.

They were told his Tinkoff Bank, Russia's second-largest at the time, would be nationalised unless all ties to its founder were cut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I couldn't discuss the price,\" Tinkov told the New York Times. \"It was like a hostage - you take what you are offered.

It was sold for only 3% of its true value, says Tinkov.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, Tinkov lost almost $9bn (£6.5bn) of the fortune he once had, and left Russia.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d580/live/a9898f80-e0c1-11f0-a5d4-dbc340b0ceeb.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Chris Graythen/Getty Images A man wearing a white baseball cap and grey T-shirt grins while standing under a tree\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Chris Graythen/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Oleg Tinkov lost billions and left Russia after criticising the war against Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is a far cry from the way things were before Putin became president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Russians became fabulously rich by taking ownership of massive enterprises formerly owned by the state, and by exploiting the opportunities of their country's nascent capitalism. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their newly acquired wealth brought them influence and power during a period of political turmoil and they became known as oligarchs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's most powerful oligarch, Boris Berezovsky, claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, and years later he appealed for forgiveness for doing so: \"I didn't see the future greedy tyrant and usurper in him, the man who would trample freedom and stop Russia's development,\" he wrote in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Berezovsky may have exaggerated his role, but Russia's oligarchs were certainly capable of pulling strings at the highest echelons of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A little more than a year after his apology, Berezovsky was found dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK.

Collectively, they lost $263bn - or 27% of their wealth each on average.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the years that followed showed that immense benefits were to be reaped from being part of Putin's war economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lavish spending on the war spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024. It was good for even those among Russia's ultra-rich who were not making billions directly out of defence contracts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, more than half of Russia's billionaires either played some role in supplying the military or benefited from the invasion, says Giacomo Tognini, from Forbes's Wealth team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's not even counting those who aren't directly involved, but do need a relationship of sorts with the Kremlin. And I think it's fair to say that anyone running a business in Russia needs to have a relationship with the government,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140 - on the Forbes list. Their collective worth ($580bn) was just $3bn shy of the all-time high registered in the year before the invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While allowing loyalists to profit, Putin has consistently punished those who have refused to toe the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russians remember all too well what happened to oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once Russia's richest man, he spent 10 years in jail after launching a pro-democracy organisation in 2001.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfa9/live/e064d3a0-e0d7-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP Russia's richest man and oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky is seen in his cage in &quot;Matroska tishina&quot; prison on a TV screen during a video-link in the courthouse in Moscow, 15 January 2003\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mikhail Khodorkovsky was Russia's richest man but he was sent to jail and his oil company Yukos was nationalised</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the invasion, almost all of Russia's mega-rich have stayed quiet, and those few who have publicly opposed it have had to abandon their country and much of their wealth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's wealthiest are clearly key to Putin's war effort, and many of them, including the 37 business people summoned to the Kremlin on 24 February 2022, have been targeted by Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if the West wanted to make them poorer and turn against the Kremlin, it has failed, given the continuing wealth and absence of dissent among Russian billionaires.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If any of them had considered defecting to the West with their billions, the sanctions made that impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The West did everything possible to ensure that Russian billionaires rallied around the flag,\" says Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was absolutely no plan, no idea, no clear path for any of them to jump ship.

All that effectively helped Putin to mobilise the billionaires, their assets and their money, and use it to support the Russian war economy,\" he tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exodus of foreign companies in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine created a vacuum quickly filled by Kremlin-friendly business people who were allowed to buy up highly lucrative assets on the cheap.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This created a new \"army of influential and active loyalists\", argues Alexandra Prokopenko of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their future wellbeing depends on continued confrontation between Russia and the West,\" while their worst fear is the return of the previous owner, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024 alone, 11 new billionaires emerged in Russia in this way, according to Giacomo Tognini.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's leader has maintained a firm grip on the country's key movers and shakers, despite the war and Western sanctions - and in some respects because of them.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It began when video footage of a confrontation between a man in a frog suit and immigration enforcement agents in Portland, Oregon went viral, and has since spread to protests across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a lot going on with that little inflatable frog,\" says LM Bogad, a professor at University of California, Davis and a Guggenheim Fellow who specialises in performance art.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">From Pepe to Portland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's hard to talk about protests and frogs without talking about Pepe, a cartoon character embraced by far-right groups during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the meme first took off online, the image was used to signal certain emotions. Later, it was deployed to show support for Trump, including one notable meme retweeted by Trump himself, depicting Pepe with Trump's signature suit and hair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe was also depicted in right-wing online communities on 4chan, 8chan and Reddit in darker contexts, as Adolf Hitler or a member of the violent white supremacist group the Ku Klux Klan. Online conservatives traded \"rare Pepes\" and set up cryptocurrency in his name. His catchphrase, \"feels good, man\", was deployed as an inside joke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe didn't start out so controversial.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc6b/live/4222d9e0-d5e6-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A man seen wearing a Pepe shirt during the 6 January 2021 riot at Capitol Hill, where Trump supporters attempted to prevent his loss to Joe Biden</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its creator, artist Matt Furie, has been vocal about his distaste for how the image has been used. Pepe was supposed to be simply a \"chill frog-dude\" in this artist's universe of characters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog first appeared in a series of comics in 2005 - apolitical and best known for pulling his pants all the way down to pee. In the 2020 documentary Feels Good Man, which chronicles Mr Furie's efforts to wrest back control of his work, he said his Pepe drawing was inspired by his experiences with friends and roommates in his 20s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Early in his career, Mr Furie experimented with uploading his work to the nascent social web, where other users began to borrow, remix and reinvent his character. As Pepe spread into the more extreme corners of the internet, Mr Furie tried to disavow the frog, even killing him off in a comic strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Pepe lived on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It shows you that we don't control symbols,\" says Prof Bogad. \"They can change and shift and be reworked.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until recently, the popularity of Pepe meant that frogs were largely associated with the right. But that changed on 2 October, when the confrontation between a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume with a blue neck scarf and an immigration officer went viral.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14d5/live/80b0f340-d5e6-11f0-a945-f537ba447bee.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Protesters in frog suit and chicken suits stand outside the ICE centre\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The moment came just days after Trump ordered the National Guard to Portland, calling the city \"war-ravaged\". Protesters began to gather in droves on a single block just outside an immigration enforcement facility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions were high and an immigration officer sprayed a chemical agent at a protester, aiming directly into the air intake fan of the puffy frog costume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protester, Seth Todd, responded with a joke, saying he had tasted \"spicier tamales\". But the incident went viral nonetheless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Todd's attire was not too unusual for Portland, known for its quirky culture and left-wing protests that revel in the absurd - public yoga and 80s-style aerobics lessons, and nude cycling groups. The city's unofficial motto is \"Keep Portland Weird\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog even played a role in the ensuing legal battle between the Trump administration and the city, which argued the National Guard deployment was unlawful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the court ruled in October that Trump had the right to deploy troops, one judge dissented, referencing in her minority ruling the protesters' \"well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods deployed by ICE\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Observers may be tempted to view the majority's ruling, which accepts the government's characterisation of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,\" Judge Susan Graber wrote. \"But today's decision is not merely absurd.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's deployment was \"permanently\" blocked by courts just a month later, and troops have reportedly departed the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by then, the frog had become a potent anti-administration symbol for the left.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The costume was spotted across the country at No Kings protests last autumn. There were frogs - and unicorns and axolotls and dinosaurs - in San Diego and Atlanta and Boston. They were in small towns like Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and big international cities like Tokyo and London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The frog costume was back-ordered on Amazon and rose in price.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Controlling the optics</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What brings both frogs together - Pepe and the Portland frog - is the interplay between the humorous, benign cartoon amphibian and a deeper political meaning. This is what political scientists call \"tactical frivolity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy rests on what Prof Bogad calls the \"irresistible image\" - often silly, it's a \"disarming and charming\" display that calls attention to your ideas without obviously explaining them to a viewer. It's the goofy costume you wear, or the symbol you draw, or the meme you share.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bogad is both an expert in the subject and a veteran practitioner himself. He's written a book on the subject, Tactical Performance: The Theory and Practice of Serious Play, and taught workshops around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could go back to the Middle Ages - when people are dominated, they use absurdity to speak the truth a little bit and still have plausible deniability.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea of this approach is three-fold, Prof Bogad says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As protesters take on a powerful opposition, a silly costume takes control of the optics. \"It makes it look worse if you respond with violence,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Second, an image can set a certain tone for those within the movement and would-be supporters. In Portland \"it was like a radical costume ball and we all got invited\", Prof Bogad says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, this kind of tactic can offer political cover for criticism. Sometimes that shows up in claims of political memes as \"just a joke\" - a defence against critics who would brand your views as dangerous. But it's especially useful in circumstances where government criticism can be dangerous, Prof Bogad says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/934c/live/fefdc150-d5e7-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A frog costume spotted in Berlin during the No Kings protests</figcaption></p></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e275/live/1152e6a0-d5e8-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A protester in a frog costume holds a subway sandwich and wears a sticker that says No Kings\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The costumes have been frequently seen at protests in Washington DC</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He points to Otpor, the Serbian pro-democracy protest movement that supported efforts to overthrow Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 through pranks and street comedy. For years, critics of Chinese President Xi Jinping have shared images of Winnie the Pooh to signal their opposition online, where more bold-faced criticism could face censorship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have also embraced Pepe, unaware of its political affiliations in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, authoritarians don't like to be laughed at,\" Prof Bogad says. This kind of symbolism works because \"without even giving a speech, you are undermining the authoritarian script\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home in Oregon, a group of Portlanders doubled down on the viral fame and banded together to form \"Operation Inflation\", which collects and distributes inflatable costumes to protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They started a website where supporters can donate $35 to buy suits \"for community members to wear at ICE protest sites to help deflate (pun intended) the tensions surrounding protests\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brooks Brown, a co-founder of Operation Inflation, says the point is to \"shift the story that's being told\" by the Trump administration that all protesters are part of a violent mob.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our job is to build a different stage, and to force them onto ours,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Brown says the inflatables bear similarities with the Civil Rights era of the 1960s, when protesters would often dress in their Sunday finest and sit motionless as they were harassed by counter-protesters and arrested by aggressive police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pepe, Mr Brown says, \"was a fascist symbol for 4chan.

But also, so they can put something to one side to buy a little land on which we can eventually build a house, maybe buy a car,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Trump took office, Marcos says he only keeps the very minimum he needs for rent and food in the US.

He has fond memories of jamming in jazz clubs with his musician friends.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Jamaican] Joe Harriot was one of the greatest alto saxophone players and we used to play together at a place called the Metro Club in London,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To this day, Mulatu holds the UK close to his heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To me it was so really great to be back again here.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 1960s, Mulatu moved to the US to enrol at Berklee College of Music in Boston – the first African to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He studied vibraphone and percussion and began incorporating Latin jazz into his own music, recording his first two albums.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it was only when he returned to Addis Ababa in 1969 that he created his own sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He changed the face of music at home during these \"Swinging Addis\" years. Using what he had learned at Berklee and combining it with Ethiopian modes, he \"created this science called Ethio-jazz\", Mulatu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially his radical sound was met with complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember them telling me 'get off, stop, stop there'.

Was it the cello or the masenqo?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is we don't do research. We have so many great scientists in Africa. Great people, geniuses, who created all these instruments. But we don't give them credit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, he says his mission is to broaden the range of the traditional instruments of his homeland by \"computerising\" the sound.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For his fans, it is his unique blend of the modern and traditional that makes Ethio-jazz so special.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reminds me a lot of music from South Asia, melded with the pentatonic scale which reminds me more of Arab music, along with the African percussion sounds that come through,\" said concert-goer Joseph Badawi-Crook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a completely unique mix and I just fell in love with it years ago.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mulatu's legacy spans generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our grandparents or our parents or our aunts or our uncles, have seen Mulatu throughout his career,\" said London-based Ethiopian fan Solliana Kineferigb.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To also be part of the younger generation and to have the opportunity to still see him live is amazing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the touring may soon be over, Mulatu pledges to continue to bring Ethiopian music to the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not the end,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">More about African music:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A composite image of two pictures of Gen Mamadi Doumbouya.

Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His overthrow of Condé -
