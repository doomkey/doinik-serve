He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eleven other firefighters are also injured, the fire department said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,\" Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 270 people remain unaccounted for, while 76 people are injured, Hong Kong's fire service said.</p></div><div data-component=\"group-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><section class=\"sc-2d9149e5-0 cSvbpL\"><div data-testid=\"slideshowWrapper\" class=\"sc-bb9c31df-0 eyDYxi\"><hr class=\"sc-bb9c31df-13 TJGYy\"><div class=\"sc-bb9c31df-9 sc-bb9c31df-12 kJXtbZ dLZLyt\"><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-11 CMaeP loiCSF djVHpK\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">As firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessed</figcaption></p><p class=\"sc-bb9c31df-6 sc-bb9c31df-7 sc-bb9c31df-8 sc-bb9c31df-10 CMaeP bUWtCU hdoqvu guckrn\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Thick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched on</figcaption></p></div></div></section></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mood in Hong Kong has shifted from shock to anguish, as questions grow regarding who should be held accountable for the blaze.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anger has been building on social media, especially after several residents revealed in interviews that they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports of their complaints last year over renovation plans have also resurfaced, and are circulating widely online. Residents had taken issue with high renovation fees and questioned whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while polystyrene was also found on the buildings' windows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee said he had arranged inspections of \"all housing estates undergoing major repairs\" to check the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

According to the US-based Institute for the Study of War, at this rate it would take Moscow almost two more years to seize the rest of the Donetsk region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday's remarks were the first time that Putin addressed the hectic diplomatic moves of the last week, which saw the US and Ukraine hold intense discussions over a peace plan reportedly drafted in October by American and Russian officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan, which was heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, was subsequently revised. However, it is thought it does not address the issue of the occupied territories which - alongside security guarantees for Ukraine - is the biggest sticking point between Moscow and Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin said that new draft plan has now been shown to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he added it was \"absolutely necessary\" to discuss \"certain specific points that need to be put in diplomatic language\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the possibility of Crimea and the Donbas being recognised as under Russian <i id=\"de-facto\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">de facto </i>control<i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i>but not legally, Putin said: \"This is the point of our discussion with our American counterparts\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US delegation including special envoy Steve Witkoff was expected in Moscow in the first half of next week, he confirmed. US President Donald Trump told reporters that Witkoff may be joined in Moscow by the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Ukraine's top presidential aide Andriy Yermak said that US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is due to visit Kyiv later in the week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Trump said there were \"only a few remaining points of disagreement\" between Russia and Ukraine – indicating that any meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss these points was contingent on a peace deal being agreed upon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his comments to reporters Putin again expressed his contempt for the Ukrainian leadership, which he said he considered illegitimate and that there was therefore \"no use\" signing the documents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has been under martial law since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 and has therefore been unable to hold scheduled elections. Earlier this year, the Ukrainian parliament voted unanimously to affirm the legitimacy of President Zelensky, whose term in office ended in the spring. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin also dismissed warnings by European leaders that Russia could attack the European continent within the next decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That sounds laughable to us, really,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House and Donald Trump have sounded optimistic about the recent diplomatic push for peace talks, but Europeans have repeatedly expressed their scepticism over whether Putin truly intended to end the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208wjpv4r9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen accused Russia of upholding a post-World War Two mindset</a> and of seeing the European continent as a \"sphere of influence\" in which sovereign nations could be \"carved up\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

An Elabe survey this week found that 73% supported the measure. Young people – aged 25-34 – were the least supportive, but even in this age group there was a 60% majority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a random BBC test of opinion on Paris streets, a similar picture emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a good thing,\" said Louis, a 22-year-old student. \"It can help make the army bigger, but it's also a way to love your nation more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eilan, another student, said: \"In military service you meet people from everywhere.

It's a pity the president is not really interested in young people – their mental health, their financial situation, and instead is focusing on this military service.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was in 1996 that then-President Jacques Chirac took the decision to end military service, as part of the peace dividend from the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compulsory military training for young men had been part of national life since the French Revolution, which created the idea of the citizen-soldier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 1798 law setting up conscription read: \"Every Frenchman is a soldier and is bound to the defence of the homeland.\" And after defeat by Prussia in 1871, Republican leader Léon Gambetta said: \"When in France a citizen is born, he is born a soldier.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Algerian war of independence was the last conflict fought by French conscripts, with more than 12,000 killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the 1990s, service had been reduced to 10 months, with options for civilian work instead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the last conscript passed out in 2001 there have been various, nebulous attempts to retain something of the spirit of military service, which proponents said fostered a sense of cohesion and equality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lycée (high-school) students still have to attend a Day of Defence and Citizenship, where they are given lectures on rights and duties, and attend a flag-raising ceremony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his first term, Macron also established a Universal National Service – a four-week course in civic responsibilities and practical training – which was supposed to build national solidarity following the terrorist attacks of the 2010s. But the scheme was panned as an expensive and ill-attended form of holiday camp, and was dropped earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though this new scheme appears to enjoy a broadly favourable reception, there are still questions over its funding – with a debt crisis looming over the country and parliament still unable to approve a 2026 budget.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

While a number of smaller airlines continue to fly to Venezuela, thousands of passengers have been affected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has deployed a large force to waters off Venezuela, which it says is to combat drug trafficking but which Venezuela's leader has denounced as an attempt to overthrow him. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's civil aviation authority, which reports to the country's ministry of transport, announced on Wednesday that Iberia, TAP Portugal, Gol, Latam, Avianca and Turkish Airlines would lose their landing and take-off rights with immediate effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a reference to the heightened US military activity off the coast of Venezuela, it also accused the airlines of \"joining the actions of state terrorism promoted by the United States government and unilaterally suspending air commercial operations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has deployed 15,000 troops and the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, to within striking distance of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US says the aim of the deployment, the largest by the US in the region since it invaded Panama in 1989, is to combat drug trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces have carried out at least 21 strikes on boats they say were carrying drugs, killing more than 80 people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, they have not provided evidence that the boats carried drugs and many analysts have pointed out that the US deployment is unusually large for a counter-narcotics operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government thinks the aim of the operation is to depose President Nicolás Maduro, whose re-election last year was denounced by the Venezuelan opposition and many foreign nations as rigged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid the rising tensions, the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) issued a warning on Friday to flight operators operating in Maiquetía, the international airport serving Caracas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It urged airlines \"to exercise caution... at all altitudes due to the worsening security situation and heightened military activity in and around Venezuela\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was in the wake of that warning that the now-banned airlines suspended their flights to Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An attempt by aviation industry body Iata to defuse the situation - by stressing that its member airlines were keen to restore operations - failed to appease the Venezuelan government.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, both Maduro and his US counterpart Donald Trump have signalled a willingness to hold direct talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about it on Air Force One, Trump said that he \"might talk\" to Maduro, but also warned that \"we can do things the easy way, that's fine, and if we have to do it the hard way that's fine, too\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro, meanwhile, uploaded a video of himself driving around Caracas pointing to Christmas decorations, in what appeared to be an attempt to show that life in the city was going on as normal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It was first discovered as far back as 1931, but it wasn't until fracking became legal in Argentina in 2014 that the deposits could be commercially accessed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fracking is a method of mining that first became widespread in the US in the early 2000s, whereby a high-pressure mixture of water, sand and chemicals is injected into the ground. This cracks or fractures the rock, allowing the gas or oil trapped inside to be brought to the surface.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e157/live/5a671e50-c941-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Matías Zibell García Mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez leaning on tyres at his garage\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Matías Zibell García</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Business has boomed for mechanic Fabio Javier Jiménez</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first fracking operation in Vaca Muerta was a joint operation between Argentina's majority state-owned oil firm Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) and US giant Chevron.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By February of this year, there were 3,358 wells in active production in Vaca Muerta, according to the Argentine Institute of Oil and Gas. Of these, 1,632 are oil, and 1,726 are gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This accounts \"for more than half of Argentina's oil and gas production\", says Nicolás Gadano, chief economist at the Empiria consultancy and a former YPF official.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that the cost of the fracked oil is cheaper than conventional extraction elsewhere in Argentina, because the latter now comprises very old deposits where the remaining oil is hard to get to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Gandini, director of Econojournal, a media outlet specialising in energy, agrees. \"We have not been able to find new conventional deposits that are very cost-competitive, with the exception of conventional gas deposits in the offshore southern basin,\" he says. \"All other onshore deposits are three to four times more expensive than Vaca Muerta.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Añelo's size and population has soared over the past decade</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil and gas from Vaca Muerta has given Argentina energy self-sufficiency, overturning decades of shortages and the need for expensive imports. It has also allowed Argentina to export oil and gas, helping it to earn foreign currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Last year, there was a significant external surplus in the energy sector of $6bn [£4.6bn],\" says Mr Gadano. \"This year, we are aiming for a similar figure, with much higher volume but lower prices due to the drop in international prices.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Gandini adds that the fact Argentina is now exporting more energy than it imports \"is very important\" for the country, \"especially when two or three years ago we were in the red\". Yet he adds that it won't be \"the panacea\" that cures an Argentine economy that has long battled high inflation and public spending, and defaulting on its national debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think there is an overrepresentation of the value that Vaca Muerta can bring to solving the structural problems facing the Argentine economy,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"However, if one looks at what Argentina has today to generate more dollars, it does not have many sectors other than Vaca Muerta. It has agriculture, but agriculture also has its problems: the country has not been able to expand its agricultural production base. Beyond agriculture, mining lags far behind.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other commentators argue that oil and gas extraction from Vaca Muerta is being held back from reaching its full potential because Argentina's bad credit rating is putting off international investors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also point to strict limits on how many pesos that firms can exchange into foreign currencies. This has long been the case to curb the flight of capital out of the country, and to protect the reserves of the Argentina central bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Companies say 'everything is fine with Vaca Muerta, but I haven't been able to get a single dollar out of Argentina for 15 years, so we make money but we have to reinvest it there by force',\" explains Mr Gadano. \"That's not how the world works, that's not how companies work, especially the big international players.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government of President Javier Milei lifted foreign exchange controls for individuals last April, and following his party's victory in mid-term elections last month, it is expected that restrictions on companies may soon also be lifted.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other critics say that Vaca Muerta is being hampered by insufficient pipelines, poor roads and the lack of a railway connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gustavo Medele is energy minister of Neuquén Province, where the town of Añelo and much of Vaca Muerta is found. He says that the provincial government \"is doing what it has to do and what it can do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What continues to help Vaca Muerta is that it has achieved a political consensus – all main parties support increased mining. \"All the relevant political forces agree that this is an industry that needs to grow,\" notes Mr Gadano.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Roads in and around Añelo are now busy with traffic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This consensus has become a problem for those who, since the start of fracking at Vaca Muerta, have voiced their environmental concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are really losing in the public debate,\" says Fernando Cabrera, director of environmental pressure group Observatorio Petrolero Sur. \"There is a very noticeable difference in the capacity for public and media influence; provincial legislatures are largely in favour of exploitation, as are the national chambers, so it is a very uneven dynamic.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back at Mr Jiménez's garage, business is so good that he has opened a second branch. \"When we came to Añelo, we were happy to service two vehicles a day. Then we serviced 10 vehicles, and now we have 20 vehicles a day.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet he is sceptical that oil and gas exploitation will be the solution to all the country's problems. \"Yes there will surely be oil and gas for many years to come, but that does not mean that Argentina will not continue to experience economic and political ups and downs.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

This part of the country is the heartland of the Shia Muslim community, and for decades has been under the sway of Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia and political party. On streets, banners with the faces of fighters killed in battle hang from lamp-posts, celebrating them as \"martyrs of the resistance\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I arrived in Froun an hour after the strike. Rescue workers had already removed the body parts of the only casualty - a man who was later described as a \"Hezbollah terrorist\" by the Israeli military. Despite a ceasefire deal that came into force last November, ending the latest war with Hezbollah, Israel has continued with its bombing, almost every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Who is going to help us?\" one resident, Mohamad Mokdad, asked me. The car had been hit as it passed in front of his house, and he was still cleaning up the veranda. \"There were body parts here and in the trees.\" He sounded despondent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're against all this...

Thousands of Lebanese soldiers would then be sent to areas that had been effectively under Hezbollah control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A year later, the Israeli military continues to occupy at least five hilltops in southern Lebanon and has carried out air and drone attacks across the country on targets it claims are linked to Hezbollah. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn81j54xjx1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Last Sunday, it killed the group's chief of staff and four others</a> in a strike on a building in the Dahieh district, outside Beirut.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unifil, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon that operates south of the Litani, says Israel has committed more than 10,000 air and ground violations during the ceasefire.

The group is considered a terrorist organisation by countries including the UK and the US. But in Lebanon, Hezbollah is more than a militia.

Worried that an attack could be imminent, residents made a public appeal, late at night, for Lebanese soldiers to be deployed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I visited Beit Lif the following morning. (To travel to southern Lebanon, we had to inform Hezbollah's media office in Beirut; the group did not interfere in our reporting.) The village had a pre-war population of around 8,000; now, less than a third remains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local imam, a 63-year-old man who did not want to have his name published, told me the Lebanese soldiers had arrived with Unifil troops, patrolled the streets and left after about five hours, before dawn. The Lebanese military has refused to inspect private properties, possibly in order not to be seen to be collaborating with Israel; in Beit Lif too, the imam said, they did not enter any houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we spoke, half a dozen men gathered around us on the grounds of a mosque that had been destroyed in an Israeli air strike during the war. Quietly, one of them told me: \"Hezbollah needs to decide: it either responds to Israel or accepts defeat, disarms and let us move on with our lives. This can't continue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public criticism of Hezbollah is still rare but, exhausted, some appear to be questioning the old consensus. We then heard a distant sound – from Israeli fighter jets in the sky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the locations that appeared to have been highlighted in Col Adraee's  message was a house in front of the municipality building. Israel has frequently accused Hezbollah of embedding its arsenal in civilian areas, an allegation I had also heard from some residents during the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ezzat Hammoud, the Beit Lif mayor, told me: \"No, no, no. There are no militants or weapons here. I can be held responsible for what I'm saying.\" So why, if that was the case, had his village attracted the attention of the Israeli military? \"Either to terrify the residents and force them to move,\" he said, \"or to put pressure on the Lebanese army to confront people.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4967/live/59a8a5a0-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man is seen on a road, with a woman nearby, in front of a building which has a large image on the side.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Haider said his house had been marked by the Israeli military as a building being used by Hezbollah, which he denied</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A man called Haider, whose family owned the house, insisted on taking me to visit it.

He said the group would \"never\" surrender its weapons, which he called the \"source of its strength\". \"The enemy,\" Qassem said, referring to Israel and the United States, \"wants to erase our life and our existence, but we'll remain steadfast. We'll either live with dignity or die with dignity.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hezbollah's arsenal, more powerful than that of the country's own army, has long divided the Lebanese. Opponents accuse Hezbollah of dragging Lebanon into wars and of defending the interests of the group's main backer, Iran. They see this as a unique opportunity to disarm it. But President Aoun, who is a former army chief, has refused to use force against Hezbollah, saying this could exacerbate sectarian divisions and lead to a civil war. If the authorities were not careful, Aoun said in April, \"we'll lead Lebanon to ruin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Western diplomat familiar with the discussions told me the Lebanese authorities were under increasing pressure from the Trump administration, which was frustrated with the pace of the efforts and supported Israel's actions in Lebanon. \"Some are seeing this as the 'Lebanese way' of doing things,\" the diplomat said about the disarmament plans, and \"aren't convinced\" it can work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army is expected to announce it has completed the disarmament of the group in the areas south of the Litani next month. The army, an intelligence officer told me, would then turn its attention to other parts of the country - Hezbollah's presence is also significant in the Dahieh and the eastern Bekaa Valley. This will be a more challenging, and risky, mission without the group's consent, and there is no timeline for that.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/14b7/live/7ec86e60-cac8-11f0-b7d6-15745cdbcf61.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Neha Sharma/BBC An older man with a weathered face and grey hair looks into the camera.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Neha Sharma/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nayef al-Rida is one of the few remaining residents in the border village of Yaroun, which was devastated during the war</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I drove on to the border village of Yaroun.

Pope Leo and leaders of other Christian traditions will gather to mark the anniversary of an ancient council that took place there 1,700 years ago.  In 325 AD, among other key decisions, more than 200 bishops at the council affirmed the belief that Jesus was the son of God, eventually leading to what is known as the Nicene Creed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eastern and Western branches of Christianity later dramatically split, but during this trip there will be messages of togetherness and healing divisions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey the Pope will also visit the Blue Mosque, as both his immediate predecessors Pope Francis and Pope Benedict XVI had done.

He denies the charge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chakwera vacated the palace after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4n0rrn1no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">losing the elections to President Peter Mutharika</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late on Wednesday, police denied reports that Chakwera had been arrested but confirmed securing a search warrant for his residence after information suggested the stolen dogs were being kept there.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chakwera, who came second with 33% of the vote in the September election, is facing numerous allegations of public resources mismanagement, especially during the handover.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His Malawi Congress Party (MCP) has accused Mutharika's administration of  \"harassing and intimidating\" the former leader. Chakwera has not commented.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local media have reported the theft of state property from two presidential residences - the Kamuzu Palace in Lilongwe, and Sanjika Palace, in Blantyre, the country's second biggest city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The four dogs, valued at $2,300 (£1,700), were taken out of the palace between 19 September and 4 October, according to the state prosecutors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Wednesday, police said they had \"intensified investigations following reports of property looting\" from Kamuzu Palace.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Malawi Police Service assures the public that the investigation is progressing smoothly,\" it added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MCP MPs boycotted parliamentary sessions on Wednesday and camped out at Chakwera's residence in Lilongwe amid reports that he faced arrest following a heightened police presence, local media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chakwera, a pastor before entering politics, accepted defeat and has kept a low profile since the election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He made his first public appearance last week when he announced that he had accepted a Commonwealth appointment to help mediate in Tanzania's post-election unrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mutharika, who first served as president between 2014 and 2020, campaigned on a pledge of a \"return to proven leadership\" - which resonated with Malawian voters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He returned to power in a country that is in deep crisis, with a severe shortage of fuel and foreign currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former law professor was rarely seen in public during the campaign, in contrast to Chakwera who held numerous rallies across Malawi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result, speculation about Mutharika's health is rife and there are questions about whether he has the stamina to lead Malawi again at the age of 85.</p></div></div></body></html>"

That is when a leaked draft of a 28-point US plan to end the war first emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan, whose references to Ukraine giving up territory and limiting the size of its military led some to describe it as a \"Russian wish list\", caused consternation in Kyiv and sent European diplomats scrambling to limit the perceived damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some ways, it felt like a re-run of events in August, when anxious European leaders rushed to Washington to bend Trump's ear after the American president rolled out the red carpet to Putin in Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the weekend, the Europeans had drafted a counter-proposal, also 28 points long, which replaced the blunt territorial concessions of the US plan with \"negotiations on territorial swaps\" and stiffened the language on security guarantees, a key concern of Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But how much influence the Europeans had over Sunday's talks in Geneva remains unclear.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A joint US-Ukrainian statement, issued after the talks wrapped up, spoke of \"highly productive\" discussions, saying any future agreement must deliver a \"sustainable and just peace\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer was one of several European leaders who seized on the words \"sustainable and just\" as indicating that progress had been made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials sounded relieved too. The First Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergiy Kyslytsya, said the latest version of the plan had been slimmed down to just 19 points, with the most contentious issues – territory and Ukraine's future relations with Nato – put off for Trump and Zelensky to decide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid recriminations over how the original 28-point version had been leaked (with fingers pointing in multiple directions), a tight veil of secrecy has been drawn around the latest version.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite talks in Abu Dhabi involving the US army secretary, Dan Driscoll (a new addition to Trump's Ukraine team), Ukraine's military intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, and Russian officials, Ushakov says the plan has still not been discussed in detail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff due in Moscow next week and talk of Zelensky paying another visit to the White House, it seems the pace of diplomacy is not about to let up.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/62b3/live/e1560c10-cacb-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A white-haired man in blue jacket, white shirt and pink tie speaks and gestures  in an ornate office.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But where are we?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are now on a fast track to something,\" says Daniel Fried, former US assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To a failure or a fast track to a success, I can't say, but it's moving fast.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ambassador Fried says last week's 28-point US plan was a \"hot mess\" but that the impetus behind it is real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To the Trump administration's credit, it's pushing hard for a settlement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sense of dread which settled over Kyiv last week - which caused Zelensky to observe that Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history – has lifted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Geneva, Ukraine's delegation was very satisfied,\" says Myroslava Gongadze, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center, speaking from Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The point of the exercise was not exactly to make an agreement but to throw out that 28-point plan and put some Ukrainian interest in that possible negotiation and show that Ukraine is really willing to discuss and negotiate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if Kyiv feels it has successfully countered some of the worst of what was being demanded – and we still do not know how much – there are plenty of lingering concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief among them: what sort of security guarantees can it expect to receive if it finally strikes a deal with the country that launched an unprovoked invasion of its territory and still seems to covet more?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The essential question we must ask here is security guarantees,\" says Gongadze. \"Who will be giving those guarantees, who is being held accountable and which border would not be violated?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the answers are weak, then it's setting up Ukraine for another crisis.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca9f/live/2fdc0ef0-cace-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters A middle-aged man in a blue jacket, white shirt and gold tie gesticulates in a room.  \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff is in due in Moscow next week </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the original US document's rather vague promise to offer \"reliable security guarantees\", European leaders spoke of a US guarantee that \"mirrors Article 5\", a reference to Nato's principle of collective defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, the Axios news website reported the existence of a separate US paper, presented to Ukraine, which outlines \"security assurance modelled on the principles of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, adapted to the circumstances of this conflict\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This critical aspect of the plan is clearly still a work in progress. Following Tuesday's virtual meeting of the UK-French led Coalition of the Willing, participants agreed with the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, to \"accelerate joint work with the United States to take forward the planning on security guarantees\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sir Keir Starmer says operational plans for a multinational \"reassurance force\" for Ukraine are fully formed but until the Trump administration indicates what, if any, backup it is willing to provide, those plans remain largely theoretical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Security guarantees are going to have to be fleshed out,\" says Ambassador Fried.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Coalition of the Willing is a great idea, but it hasn't landed on any result to date, partly because they are waiting to see whether the Americans will back them and partly because they're waiting to see what they're going into.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where we are on territory is another big unknown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week's 28-point plan stated, bluntly, that Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk would be \"recognised as de facto Russian\", and that Ukrainian forces would withdraw from the heavily contested parts of the Donetsk region still under Kyiv's control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this language vanished in the European counter-proposal. Ukraine, it said, would commit \"not to recover its occupied sovereign territory through military means\". All territorial negotiations, it said, would \"start from the Line of Contact\" – the current front lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not known the extent to which Europe's approach informed the document that emerged after the talks in Geneva.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The joint US-Ukrainian communique offered only an oblique insight, saying the two sides \"reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine's sovereignty\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The word \"fully\" appeared to be carrying a lot of weight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given Trump's mercurial approach to the war in Ukraine, Putin's lingering ambitions and Zelensky's domestic difficulties - the current round of diplomacy takes place in the midst of a corruption scandal that is undermining his domestic standing - it is extremely difficult to know where this process goes next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it might be overly optimistic to think we are near the end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're still in the middle of this process,\" says Leslie Shedd, another of the Atlantic Council's non-resident fellows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's certainly a long way to go still.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for all the apparent chaos surrounding the Trump administration's efforts, including a constantly shifting – and possibly competing – cast of characters, Shedd believes the administration is serious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It appears that the president… [is] truly prioritising finding a peace in Ukraine. And I think that is actually really important.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Trump says he will hold further talks with the Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic talks have continued after the initial draft plan was criticised by Ukrainian and European leaders as being too favourable to Russia. Among the proposals was handing Russia territory in eastern Ukraine currently controlled by Kyiv. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan has since been revised to better reflect Ukraine's interests and the views of European allies. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he was ready to meet Trump to discuss outstanding \"sensitive points\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the leaked audio recording obtained and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-25/witkoff-discusses-ukraine-plans-with-key-putin-aide-transcript\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">shared as a transcript by Bloomberg</a>, Witkoff appeared to advise Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign policy adviser, on how to get on Trump's good side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News has not independently verified the reported 14 October call, but Trump said it represented a \"very standard form of negotiations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the leaked conversation, the two men reportedly talked about ending the war, with Ushakov asking if it would be useful to get their bosses - Putin and Trump - to speak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff is quoted as saying that \"my guy is ready to do it\", before suggesting how to go about the call.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just reiterate that you congratulate the president [Trump] on this achievement... that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen,\" Witkoff is quoted as saying. \"I think from that it's going to be a really good call.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told the president that you - that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal. That's my belief,\" Witkoff adds, according to the transcript. \"The issue is is that we have two nations that are having a hard time coming to a compromise.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continues: \"I'm even thinking that maybe we set out like a 20-point peace proposal, just like we did in Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call ends with Witkoff telling Ushakov of an imminent Zelensky visit to the White House, and that \"if possible\", Trump and Putin should talk before that meeting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-and-a-half hour phone call between the US and Russian presidents, news of which emerged as Zelensky was on his way to Washington last month.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the Trump-Putin call, the US president had appeared to be running out of patience with his Russian counterpart and had suggested he might provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the time Zelensky entered the White House, the atmosphere seemed to have changed. Trump said giving Kyiv Tomahawks could escalate the conflict and that he believed Putin \"wants to end the war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the call being leaked, Yuri Ushakov told Russian state media that it was done to \"hinder, probably\" and that it was \"unlikely\" to be done to improve relations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also confirmed that Witkoff would be visiting Moscow next week as per a \"preliminary agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not clear who was behind the leak, but Bloomberg has also transcribed another reported call between Ushakov and Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who spent days with Witkoff in Miami in late October weeks before the 28-point draft plan emerged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to that transcript, Dmitriev tells his Russian colleague: \"We'll just make this paper from our position, and I'll informally pass it along, making it clear that it's all informal. And let them do like their own.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apparently angered by the report, Dmitriev complained of a \"well-funded, well-organised malicious media machine built to spread fake narratives, smear opponents and keep people confused\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It's like Orwell's book 1984, and that scares me,\" Macy Neyland said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After news of the case broke, Communications Minister Anika Wells told parliament the government would not be swayed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will not be intimidated by threats. We will not be intimidated by legal challenges. We will not be intimidated by big tech. On behalf of Australian parents, we will stand firm,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Digital Freedom Project (DFP) announced the case had been filed in the High Court on Wednesday. Teenagers rely on social media for information and association, and a ban could hurt the nation's most vulnerable kids - young people with disability, First Nations youth, rural and remote kids and LGBTIQ+ teenagers - the most, the group said on their website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Led by a New South Wales parliamentarian, John Ruddick, DFP said their challenge would hinge on the ban's impact on political communication, and whether it was proportional to the law's aims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other measures to improve online safety should be used instead, the group argued, pointing to digital literacy programmes, the forced introduction of age-appropriate features for platforms, and age assurance technologies which have greater privacy protections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noah Jones argued the government's policy was \"lazy\". \"We are the true digital natives and we want to remain educated, robust, and savvy in our digital world... They should protect kids with safeguards, not silence.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australian media have previously reported that Google, which owns YouTube, has also been considering launching a constitutional challenge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though opposed by the tech companies who will be charged with enforcing it, the ban is supported by most Australian adults, according to polls. However, some mental health advocates say it may cut kids off from connection, and others say it could push youngsters to even-less-regulated corners of the internet.</p></div></div></body></html>"

They were words that brought crowds out across Italy demanding change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two years on, MPs have voted for a law on femicide after a long and passionately debated session of parliament. It makes Italy one of very few places to categorise femicide as a distinct crime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Introduced by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the law was backed by her own hard-right government as well as opposition MPs.

More than 270 people have been reported missing and thousands of residents are in evacuation shelters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Images from the scene show several of the high-rise blocks still ablaze, and thick smoke billowing into the air, dominating the Chinese territory's skyline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed condolences to victims, including a \"firefighter who died in the line of duty\", state media report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Where and when did the fire start?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high.

The BBC visited one such facility in Noida, near Delhi, on a weekday morning a few days back. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a packed waiting hall outside the doctor's consulting room, anxious parents stood in line with children sneezing, coughing or complaining of breathing difficulties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most started falling ill in October, when the capital's air quality dipped to hazardous levels and waiting times for doctor's appointment had stretched longer than usual.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toxic air is a recurring problem in Delhi and across parts of northern India during the winter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There isn't a single cause behind the problem, but a mix of factors like low wind speeds, industrial emissions, vehicle exhaust, dropping temperatures and the seasonal burning of crop stubble in neighbouring states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the last month, Delhi's Air Quality Index (AQI) - which measures different types of pollutants, including the level of fine particulate matter PM2.5 that can clog lungs - has been hovering between 300 and 400. This is more than 20 times the limit recommended by the World Health Organization. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Readings above 400 affect all healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases, but high exposure to PM2.5 hits children and the elderly the hardest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the capital, many hospitals have seen an influx of children who are sick because of the unbreathable air.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These particles can affect the child's immunity, especially because their system is still developing and the cells are learning an immune response in the early years,\" Dr Shishir Bhatnagar, the paediatrician at the Noida clinic, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These cases have increased tenfold in recent years.

This year, it even tried cloud seeding to trigger artificial rain, without success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But none of it has helped ease the pollution crisis that sparks anxiety among the city's 20 million people - particularly among parents of young children. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0fa0/live/56f66ff0-c8f1-11f0-a0af-d3336cb86e2a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images A child on a railway platform through dense smog as the temperature drops in Lucknow, India, on 23 January, 2024.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">High exposure to PM2.5 - or fine particulate matter - hits children the hardest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khushboo Bharti, 31, says she shudders every time she remembers the night of 13 November, when she had to rush her one-year-old daughter Samaira to the emergency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember her waking up with a violent cough that made her vomit several times,\" Ms Bharti says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She tried the usual home remedies, but nothing worked.

And the toxic air outdoor makes things worse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These children are consistently exposed to high degrees of pollution so their lung defence systems are reduced. If you fail to treat such childhood infections, it can cause permanent damage to the lungs,\" says Dr Fathahudeen. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He points out that several studies show how early childhood infections caused by the exposure of \"immature lungs\" to air pollution can lead to chronic obstructive airway disease in adulthood, similar to what's seen among smokers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Fathahudeen says those who can should strictly keep their children indoors and make sure they are properly hydrated and wear N95 masks - which filter out 95% of the pollutants - when outdoors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But parents question how long can they keep children shut indoors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're growing, they need space to play and while they do get brief moments in nature, we are now forced to stop them,\" said Seema*, a mother. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They protest sometimes, but what choice do we have?

And once they reach the level of agitation where they've started picking a fight with a flight attendant or passenger, he said they're unlikely to remember Duffy's words or calm down. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The underlying problem, he argues, is people letting their tempers get the best of them, which he sees as a worsening problem across all of society, not just on airplanes, and not just in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the secretary started posting about the campaign on X, some of his subsequent posts have been flooded with thousands of comments critical of Duffy's message.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want us to be respectful humans at the airport stop treating us like cattle,\" one X user commented. \"Remove the demoralising and humiliating TSA checks (that accomplish nothing) and find a way to get the airlines to give more than 2 inches of space per seat.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and president of Atmosphere Research Group, told the BBC that, while Duffy makes a valid point that being considerate was important, his call to dress nicer won't change a thing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could be dressed in black tie and still be a jerk, and you could be wearing sweatpants and a sweatshirt and be the most considerate person in the world. The clothes, in this case, do not make the person,\" Mr Harteveldt said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number of commenters on Duffy's X post have pointed out that the reason they dress so casually is because of how cramped plane cabins have become, as well as the expectation of extended delays. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Tell you what,\" one X user commented. \"You get the planes running on time, and we won't dress to spend the night in the damn airport.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another wrote: \"Can I get my legroom back?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One X user, who has nearly 500,000 followers, posted: \"Duffy is absolutely right...BUT our declining travel dress is also a reflection of how airlines treat us. Cattle boarding, tiny seats, penny pinching every beverage cost and just generally miserable.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Echoing what many social media users have pointed out, Mr Harteveldt said the airlines bore some responsibility for passengers' bad behaviour, too, by making their \"economy cabins so unpleasant and so physically uncomfortable\" that they naturally put passengers in a bad mood. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Couple that with minimal flight attendant staffing, minimal amenities on board, and the airlines' embrace of the pay-for-what-you-want business model, \"you don't get people smiling as they walk down the loading bridge to the plane,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, others have praised the secretary's core message of respect and kindness, with one commenting: \"I will do my small part to spread civility in my own life.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Transportation (DOT) says the campaign isn't only about saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" - it's also about reducing the amount of violent and disruptive incidents on airplanes and in airports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agency says that since 2019 there's been a 400% increase in in-flight outbursts, including both unruly behaviour and violent attacks. Since 2021, the department has recorded 13,800 unruly passenger incidents, while one in five attendants have experienced a physical incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts dispute that air travel has declined in quality. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dan Bubb, an aviation historian and professor at University of Nevada Las Vegas, told the BBC that, despite the rise in incivility cases, statistically that number wasn't very significant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are far more travellers and flights now than there used to be, and Prof Bubb said that makes it difficult to compare today's airline incidents with past decades. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Keyes pointed out what he sees as another major issue with Duffy's message: air travel used to bring a host of other issues we no longer face today. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's laughable how much worse air travel was back then,\" Mr Keyes said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flying was far less safe, he said, noting that planes crashed and were hijacked more frequently. Flights were also far more expensive relative to income. Among other drawbacks: the cabins were filled with cigarette smoke, and flight attendants faced rampant sexism and stringent physical requirements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Keyes believes the FAA and DOT could make more of a difference in reducing passenger stress by pushing airlines to minimise the number of delays and cancellations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Bubb said it would also help to \"give passengers a little more physical space in terms of seat size and legroom, include meal service in the price of their tickets, reduce alcohol consumption, make going through security at airports less stressful, make parking at airports easier, expand boarding area space at airport gates\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And, he added, we do still need to encourage passengers to be courteous to flight crews and each other.</p></div></div></body></html>"
