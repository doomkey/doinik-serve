The US team has not commented since leaving Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Tuesday, Putin said changes proposed by Kyiv and Europe to a US-backed draft peace plan were unacceptable, adding if Europe \"wants to go to war and starts one, we are ready right now\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine and its allies have been lobbying the US to amend its draft peace deal, which the White House has sought to secure rapid agreement on and the Kremlin has previously indicated it was receptive to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That plan, which was widely seen as being favourable to Russia after being <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">leaked to the media in November</a>, has undergone several changes in recent weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the proposal after the Moscow meeting, Putin's senior aide Yuri Ushakov said the Kremlin \"agreed with some points… but some things we criticised\". He added: \"We have not come up with a compromise version yet... A lot of work lies ahead.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Key disagreements between Moscow and Kyiv remain, including over Ukraine agreeing to cede territory it continues to control and security guarantees provided by Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow and Ukraine's European allies also remain starkly at odds over their expectations of what a peace settlement should look like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking ahead of the talks, Putin lashed out at leaders on the continent who have supported Kyiv's defensive war effort since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said European leaders were under the illusion they could inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. His country, he said, \"wasn't planning to go to war with Europe - but if Europe suddenly wants to go to war and starts one, we are ready right now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he expected to be briefed on the Kremlin talks by the US team after the meeting, though it was unclear whether Witkoff and Kushner would fly to Kyiv or other European capitals for further in-person negotiations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before the Kremlin talks took place, the Ukrainian leader said on Tuesday there was an opportunity to end the war \"now more than ever\", but that elements of the proposals still needed to be worked out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everything depends on today's discussions,\" Zelensky told a press conference during an official visit to Ireland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said there were \"no simple solutions\", repeating his country's insistence that Kyiv take part in peace discussions, and that clear security guarantees be agreed, such as Nato membership - a move long opposed by Russia and ruled out by Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to stop the war in such a manner that in one year, Russia would not come back\", Zelensky added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian representatives have held two rounds of high-level talks on the draft plan in recent weeks, which have been attended by Witkoff, Kushner and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House said the proposals had been \"very much refined\" as a result, although details of the updated plan have not been confirmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin - who believes Russia has the initiative on the battlefield - had appeared immovable on his demands as recently as last week, while Zelensky has repeatedly said he would never relinquish control of eastern Ukrainian regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Tuesday's talks were under way, Trump told his cabinet in Washington that the conflict had not been easy to resolve, describing the conflict as \"a mess\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a Fox News interview broadcast on Tuesday, Rubio said the US had \"made some progress\" in recent weeks, but refused to be drawn on how confident he was that a deal could be reached, saying much rested with the Russian president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He continued: \"The decisions have to be made, in the case of Russia, by Putin alone - not his advisers, Putin only. Putin can end this war on the Russian side.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, fighting continued on the front lines on Tuesday. Ukraine's military said it was still engaging Russian troops in the key eastern city of Pokrovsk - contradicting Moscow's claim to have captured it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia's Ministry of Defence shared a video on Telegram claiming to show its troops holding up flags in the strategically important city, which they have been trying to seize for over a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's eastern military command claimed Russia had tried to \"flag-plant\" in the city so that \"propagandists\" could say it had been captured. \"They fled in a hurry, and the mopping up of enemy groups continues,\" it said in a statement on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's military said its forces still controlled the northern part of the city, with Russian units suffering heavy losses, while international observers also disputed Russia's claim to the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military in Kyiv also dismissed Russia's claims to have captured the north-eastern Ukrainian border town of Vovchansk and said it had \"significantly improved\" its position in the northeastern city of Kupyans, which Russia claimed to have conquered a fortnight ago.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump said the US would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His disparaging comments came as immigration authorities were reported to be planning an enforcement operation in Minnesota's large Somali community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials in the state have condemned the plan, arguing it could unfairly sweep up American citizens who may appear to be from the East African nation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minneapolis and St Paul, which together are known as the Twin Cities, are home to one of the largest Somali communities in the world and the largest in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his comments on Tuesday, which came at the end of an hours-long televised cabinet meeting, Trump said: \"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, 'Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't care. I don't want them in our country.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With Somalia, which is barely a country, you know, they have no, they have no anything. They just run around killing each other. There's no structure,\" Trump said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then turned to criticising Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat and the first Somali-American to be elected to Congress who he has clashed with repeatedly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I always watch her,\" Trump said, adding that Omar \"hates everybody.

The New York Times first reported the operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, declined to comment on planned operations and denied that any people would be targeted based on race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country,\" said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a news conference, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said that an operation by ICE \"means due process will be violated\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to local leaders, there are about 80,000 people living there who are originally from Somalia, and the vast majority are American citizens. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tracking the ICE tactics used in Trump's mass deportation drive</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has intensified its immigration crackdown in the wake of the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington DC last week, which killed Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and seriously injured Andrew Wolfe, 24.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspect, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyl70z3940o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">who has been arrested and charged with murder</a>, is originally from Afghanistan. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Trump said on social media that he was planning on ending the Temporary Protected Status - a programme for immigrants from countries in crisis - for Somali residents living in Minnesota.

That is a lack of respect,\" he says in a coffee shop in Tegucigalpa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Donald Trump saying who we should elect violates our autonomy as a nation, and it affects our elections as well.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Irrespective of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dgp8mvmno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">whether the National Party go on to victory</a>, one of their key figures is already celebrating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, ex-President Juan Orlando Hernandez walked out of jail in Virginia a free man having served just one year of a 45-year sentence for drug-smuggling and weapons charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His release came after Trump urged Honduran voters to cast their ballots for Asfura.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hernandez was unexpectedly pardoned by Trump, despite having been found guilty last year by a court in New York of running a drug conspiracy which had brought more than 400 tonnes of cocaine into the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His time in office had also been marred by allegations of serious human rights violations by the police and security forces, particularly against government critics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, when Hernandez was arrested in 2022, then extradited to the United States and eventually jailed, most Hondurans celebrated it as a rare moment of justice in a nation riddled with institutional impunity, especially for the political elites.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has claimed the opposite, telling journalists on Air Force One that \"the people of Honduras really thought (Juan Orlando Hernandez) was set up and it was a terrible thing\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1726/live/d14f5d40-cff2-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Honduras former President Juan Orlando Hernandez is escorted by authorities as he walks towards a plane of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for his extradition to the United States\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ex-President Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States in 2022</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Journalists in Honduras who have covered the rise and fall of Hernandez – from the moment he rose to national prominence following a coup in 2009 to his extradition – struggle to recognise that description of a roundly detested former president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he does still have his supporters, particularly in the National Party. And none have been more vocal in maintaining his innocence or calling for his pardon than his wife, Ana Garcia Carias.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I sat down with the former First Lady, who described Mr Hernandez's release as \"like being in a dream, a dream made reality\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We spoke to him this morning (Tuesday) and he is in a safe place. We were so happy, we got all the children onto the phone together with my mother-in-law, and shared a moment of happiness, laughter and prayer together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In terms of the future, the question now arises as to whether Mr Hernandez will attempt to return to Honduras. Ms Garcia Carias says that his potential return depends less on the outcome of the election and more on whether the authorities will guarantee his safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It depends on the security guarantees they give him in this country\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Day after day, this government – which thank God is on its way out – used a discourse of hate about my husband that they spoke of persecution against him. And that's very dangerous for an ex-president – to return to a place where they've cultivated hatred against him from the very top, the president, down to the lowliest functionary.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Garcia Carias claimed Mr Hernandez had been a victim of \"lawfare\", of \"the deep state\" and of a \"politically motivated witch-hunt\" by the Biden administration. I put it to her that the case against her husband had largely been drawn up by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the US Department of Justice during Trump's first term, not President Biden's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a point she quickly dismissed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's what the prosecutors claimed but I think it's so illogical,\" she argues. \"In whose mind would it make sense to bring a man they say was a co-conspirator into meetings with the CIA, the DEA, to give classified information on national security?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was a political campaign (against him) involving figures in the Biden administration,\" she insisted, \"and I think there was manipulation of the facts after the event.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2ed4/live/2af6b820-cff3-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Ana Garcia Carias, wife of the former Honduran president Juan Orlando Hernandez\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ana Garcia Carias, wife of the ex-president Juan Orlando Hernandez, says he was a victim of the \"deep state\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Garcia Carias publicly recognised the role of two key MAGA figures in securing her husband's pardon: the influential conservative political advisor Roger Stone – himself the beneficiary of a Trump pardon – and the former Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They both got involved with the case\", she says. \"I recognise and thank them for their contribution.

She could no longer hide her kids, aged between nine months and 12 years, from the dangers of living in Kramatorsk. She had tried telling them the explosions they heard while seeking shelter in their cellar were just fireworks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The main thing is that there will be peace,\" Inna says. When I ask whether that means giving up her home for good, she replies, \"in this situation, yes\". They're already making plans to rebuild their lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some soldiers sent to the Donbas are also voting with their feet. There have been nearly 300,000 cases of desertion, or soldiers going  absent without official leave, since the start of Russia's full scale invasion - and numbers have risen dramatically over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them is Serhii - not his real name. We met him in hiding. His home has become his prison as he tries to evade arrest. Serhii volunteered to fight at the start of the year, whereas most of the men in his unit were forcibly mobilised - \"taken off the street\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says his unit was already below strength when it was sent to the front, near Pokrovsk, and they weren't properly trained or equipped. \"I ended up in a battalion where everything was a mess,\" he says, although he still believes this was the exception, not the norm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii deserted in May after two of his friends went awol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't have gone if we had proper leadership and someone experienced in charge,\" he says. \"I came to serve, not to run\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii is still thinking about his next move, and the possibility of returning to the army. But he echoes recent US warnings that the odds in this war are stacked against Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether he believes Ukraine can win, he is doubtful. \"If you think logically, no. A country of 140 million against us with 32 million - logically it doesn't add up.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-mariana-matveichuk\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Mariana Matveichuk</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Each announcement from US officials is usually accompanied by  grainy video, but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking, and few details on who or what was on board each vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and have vowed congressional reviews of the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats, including Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, have also said that Hegseth should resign if he ordered a strike against the two people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the reports are true, Pete Hegseth likely committed a war crime when he gave an illegal order that led to the killing of incapacitated survivors of the U.S. strike in the Caribbean,\" said Rosen, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, in a statement where she also called for a thorough investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats on the committee, many of whom served in the military, had already requested that Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly release the Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion that laid out the legal basis for the strikes, as some experts raised concerns that they could be unlawful</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the Monday press briefing, Leavitt said that President Donald Trump and  Hegseth \"have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The press secretary neither confirmed whether the first strike left two survivors, nor that the second attack was intended to kill them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Media reports that Hegseth had given the directive to kill all those on board the vessel during the 2 September strike have renewed concerns about the legality of US military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hegseth has pushed back against accusations in the report, calling them \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". On Monday, he tweeted that Admiral Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump: Hegseth said he 'did not order the death of those two men'</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean, as part of what it calls an anti-narcotics operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts\" related to the 2 September strikes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the \"admiral that was in charge of the operation\". He added that it was also seeking audio and video to \"see what the orders were\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body of the highest-ranking US military officers, met both the House and Senate's armed services committees over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Discussions centred around the operations in the region and \"the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks\", the group said. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under former-President Barack Obama, the US military came under scrutiny for firing multiple rounds from drones, in a practice <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24557333\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">known as the \"double tap\"</a>, that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the 2 September strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with BBC Newsnight on Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Trump's allegations stem from \"great envy\" for the country's natural resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also called for a direct dialogue between the US and Venezuelan governments, \"to clear the toxic atmosphere we have witnessed since July of last year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had held a brief phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in which he pressured him to resign and leave Venezuela with his family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to reports, during the call last month, Trump told Maduro that he could go to a destination of his choosing, but only if he agreed to depart immediately. After he refused, Trump posted on social media that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro requested amnesty for his top aides, and that he be allowed to continue control of the military after giving up the government. Trump refused both demands,  according to The Miami Post and Reuters, reporting the BBC has not confirmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of a \"terrorist\" organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking.

Children will still be able to view videos but without an account.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Communications Minister Anika Wells responded by saying it was \"outright weird\" that YouTube was highlighting the dangers of its platform for children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If YouTube is reminding us all that it is not safe ... that's a problem that YouTube needs to fix,\" Wells said on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The platform's statement comes as Australia's internet regulator sets her sights on two little-known apps that teens have flocked to in the lead-up to the country's social media ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lemon8, owned by the creators behind TikTok, and Yope are video and photo-sharing apps that have seen a rise in downloads recently, prompting eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to ask them to self-assess if they fall under the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv0zkxx0njo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">government reversed an exemption for YouTube</a> from the ban in July, with the eSafety Commissioner saying it was \"the most frequently cited platform\" where children aged 10 to 15 years saw \"harmful content\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Wednesday, the video-sharing platform said it would comply but that the new law undermined more than a decade's work in  building \"robust protections and parental controls that families rely on for a safer YouTube experience\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,\" wrote Rachel Lord, public policy senior manager at Google and YouTube Australia, adding that parents and educators shared these concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She labelled the ban - which comes under the Social Media Minimum Age Act - as \"rushed regulation that misunderstands our platform and the way young Australians use it\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From 10 December, anyone under 16 will be automatically signed out of their YouTube account, meaning they cannot upload content or post comments. YouTube Kids is not part of the ban. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In addition, default wellbeing settings such as reminders to take a break or go to bed will no longer be available to children as they only work for account holders. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Lord said the legislation had \"failed to allow for adequate consultation and consideration of the real complexities of online safety regulation.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">YouTube's parent company, Google, has reportedly considered launching a legal challenge to the platform's inclusion in the ban. It did not respond to a BBC request for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech on Wednesday, exactly a week before the ban kicks in, Wells said teething problems were expected in the first few days and weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Regulation, and cultural change, takes time. Takes patience,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wells said Gen Alpha - anyone under 15 years - were connected to a \"dopamine drip\" from the moment they got a smartphone and social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previous generations had dealt with bullying or potentially harmful content but it was limited, she said. New technology meant children today had \"constant access\" with algorithms and notifications \"stealing their attention for hours every day\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">described by the man who created the feature</a> as behavioural cocaine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tech companies will have to provide regular six-monthly reports on how many accounts they have for under-16s, she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the ban, tech companies can be fined up to A$49.5m (US$33m, £25m) if they don't comply with the age restrictions. They will need to deactivate existing accounts and prohibit any new accounts, as well as stopping any work arounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other platforms that fall under the ban are Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, X, Twitch, Threads, Reddit and Kick. </p></div></div></body></html>"

A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says, \"barring in China and Russia”.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Firemen get ready after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday.

whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c7vez5y57y8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Mangione when they arrested him</a> in

after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found

written in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But defence lawyers are arguing his backpack was searched without a warrant,

href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqlj130rxpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">DNA or fingerprints</a> on items discarded near the crime scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30qlr528elo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seeking the death penalty</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Embaló, 53, was running for a second term and his closest challenger was Fernando Dias da Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dias had been backed by former Prime Minister Domingos Pereira, who was initially supposed to run for president on behalf of the main opposition party, PAIGC. However, Pereira had been disqualified from the contest after the authorities said he filed his papers late.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election results were supposed to have been released on Thursday, the day after the coup took place.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened on the day of the coup?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After gunfire was heard in capital, Bissau, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1743734/politique/guinee-bissau-umaro-sissoco-embalo-se-dit-victime-dun-coup-detat/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Embaló told French news site Jeune Afrique that he had been arrested by men in uniform in the presidential palace</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Military officers then appeared on state television, announcing they had deposed the president in order to thwart a plot to destabilise the country. The military suspended the electoral process and blocked the release of the poll results.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a brief phone call, Embaló told France 24: \"I have been deposed.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others were also detained, including Pereira, Interior Minister Botché Candé and army chief Gen Biague Na N'tan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The headquarters of the electoral commission came under attack and an official has since revealed that armed men wearing balaclavas destroyed paperwork and the main computer server that stored the results - meaning the election results cannot be published.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why is there scepticism surrounding the coup?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition, civil society organisations and politicians from fellow West African nations have cast doubt on the military's announcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Embaló flew to neighbouring Senegal on a Senegalese military flight after being released from custody on Thursday - a detail that PAIGC official Flávio Baticã Ferreira finds suspicious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The way he left Guinea-Bissau, escorted like a tourist with his family and luggage, without any obstacle or resistance... all of this shows that it was not a coup, because we all know how a coup works,\" Ferreira, who was formerly a member of parliament, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the series of coups that have occurred in Africa over the last five years, no deposed leaders have been allowed to leave the country as quickly as Embaló did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a couple of analysts told the BBC that Guinea-Bissau's military may have felt that letting Embaló fly out as soon as possible would make for a smooth transition.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d9e2/live/3de60f50-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Supporters dressed in gowns bearing Umaro Sissoco Embaló's face march in the streets\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Umaro Sissoco Embaló's supporters rallied ahead of the election</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria's former president, also questioned the coup, saying a head of state would not normally be allowed to talk to foreign media on the phone during a military takeover. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What happened in Guinea-Bissau was not a coup... for want of a better word, I would say it was a ceremonial coup,\" the ex-president, who was part of a team observing the elections in Guinea-Bissau, told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jonathan is right, deposed leaders are not usually known to make contact with the outside world while under arrest.

However, it is also \"highly plausible\" that the armed forces acted independently to prevent a political stalemate, as both Embaló and Dias were claiming they had won this election, Mr Cummings told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beverly Ochieng, West Africa analyst at the intelligence firm Control Risks, also acknowledged the scepticism surrounding the coup.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, she said that tensions within the political elite, combined with the decision to ban Pereira from the presidential race, \"likely contributed to a military intervention\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is in charge of Guinea-Bissau now?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/59b3/live/4c8ef580-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Horta N'Tam looks on, wearing a military outfit\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gen Horta N'Tam, Guinea-Bissau's new leader, was considered to be a close ally of the former president</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gen N'Tam, formerly the army's chief of staff, has been sworn in as president and is due to stay in power for a transition period of one year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The general has appointed a new cabinet, comprising 23 ministers and five secretaries of state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Embaló, on the other hand, has left Senegal for Congo-Brazzaville.

It is now almost three months after her release from captivity in Iraq, where she was held for 903 days. The first four and a half months had been particularly brutal: she was, she says, trussed and hung from the ceiling, whipped, sexually abused, electrocuted.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March 2023, Ms Tsurkov, a 39-year-old doctoral student at Princeton University in the US, was living in Baghdad, conducting fieldwork for her PhD in comparative politics. She agreed to meet a woman who described herself as a friend of a friend. The woman never showed up. Ms Tsurkov started walking home. She says that a car pulled up behind her and two men dragged her in, beating and sexually assaulting her. She was driven to the outskirts of the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During the first month, they starved me and interrogated me, but at the time they didn't know about my Israeli citizenship. They're simply convinced that all foreigners are spies.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov had insisted that she was a Russian citizen. But then the kidnappers accessed her phone, and \"because I'm not a spy and don't have multiple encrypted devices, everything showed that I'm Israeli\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says that was when the torture started: electrocutions, beatings, whippings, sexual abuse and what she calls Middle Eastern \"specialities\". \"Being hung from the ceiling with hands cuffed behind my back. Being hung with the hands above my head.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And \"a particular method that is used in Iraq. It's called 'the scorpion'.

These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters File photo showing a mourner carrying a Kataib Hezbollah flag during a funeral in Baghdad, Iraq, for a commander of the Iraqi militia who was killed in an Israeli strike in Syria (22 September 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All eyes are on this case,\" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People found it hard to believe at first \"because something of this scale had not happened before,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,\" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. \"We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese. Between 2000 and 2023, 49 African countries are believed to have signed $182.3bn (£139.4bn) worth of loans with Chinese lenders.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/861d/live/443d0b20-c47e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ali Ngwane / BBC A portrait of Abigail Namtowe, 28, a farmer in Twalima village.

These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,\" says Prof Chan. \"The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African governments are \"not always getting it right\", he says, however \"this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was \"grossly unfair\" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,\" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ed-habershon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ed Habershon</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Her father, a soldier, had been killed in battle.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\".

Among the Lebanese and Vatican flags being waved as his motorcade drove from Beirut's airport, there were Hezbollah flags too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While in Lebanon, Pope Leo will meet Patriarch Bechara al-Rahi, but also other local Christian, Muslim and Druze leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has certainly cast himself as a bridge-builder; between peoples, faiths, Christian denominations and even closer to home, becoming pope as he did at a time when divisions between progressive and traditionalist Catholics appeared to be growing.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c5d7/live/9ff8ab90-ce38-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A man in white clerical garb talks to a man in a black business coat. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">With President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are, of course, limits to the ambition of togetherness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey when the Pope wanted to bring together different Christian traditions to celebrate a time when they had all been united, the Russian Orthodox Church did not send a representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There will always be criticism. Some were left disappointed that the Pope did not use his visit to Turkey to deliver a message to Erdogan about the suppression of opposition or jailing of journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in Lebanon are angered that Pope Leo is not visiting those most directly affected by war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No one has even asked about us,\" said Geryes Jabbour, who is from the Christian village of Sarda, near the Israeli border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are worn out, we have been set back decades, but we are not even on the Pope's mind,\" he said, echoing the views of some others in southern Lebanon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That day in May, Leo may have suddenly (and for him perhaps unexpectedly) acquired one of the most powerful moral platforms, but on a human level, he is still a man from South Side Chicago growing into a role where one wrong step could have huge ramifications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Pope Francis he does not seem like a man looking to shake things up quickly, but Pope Leo has shown on his first foreign trip that he is finding his voice on the world stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ghaith-solh\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ghaith Solh</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
