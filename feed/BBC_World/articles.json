not if, but when\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would \"facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 2,500 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump has warned Iran's government against killing protesters, telling demonstrators earlier this week that \"help is on its way\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cqj2qgw8w08o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump said the US would take \"very strong action\"</a> against Iran if it executed protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later said he had been told \"the killing has stopped\" - but did not rule out military action against the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a \"precautionary measure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a \"surgical strike\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With or without the world's help, the regime will fall,\" Pahlavi said. \"It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Who is Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about future leadership in Iran, Pahlavi said: \"It's for the Iranian people to decide.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: \"I am trying to help them liberate themselves,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,595 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 17 children, 164 people affiliated with the security forces or government, and 21 uninvolved civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It reports that another 22,104 protesters have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/c20c32a0-f2bf-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Fred Scott/BBC The view of Iran from the border of Iraqi Kurdistan, with buildings and tower blocks in the foreground and snow-covered mountains in the background\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Fred Scott/BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week ago</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's repression largely seems to be working.

Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1189/live/844128e0-f2c4-11f0-90ad-99f74c74ffea.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney (2nd-R) speaks during a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, at the Great Hall of the People on January 16, 2026 in Beijing, China\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Carney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  </figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A trade reset </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A frosty history </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

As Trump spoke, a bipartisan congressional delegation was visiting Greenland to show support for the territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 11-member group included Republicans who voiced concerns about the president's calls for the US to somehow acquire Greenland for national security reasons. They met MPs as well as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Group leader Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, said their trip was to listen to the locals and take their views back to Washington \"to lower the temperature\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said Greenland is vital for US security - and the US would get it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\" - a reference to ideas to buy the island or take it by force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said at the White House meeting on rural healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is sparsely-populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump has said the US needs to \"own\" it to defend it properly against possible Russian or Chinese attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has warned that military action would spell the end of Nato - the trans-Atlantic defence alliance where the US is the most influential partner. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato works on the principle that allies have to aid each other in case of attack from outside - it has never faced an option where one member would use force against another. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies have rallied to Denmark's support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also said the Arctic region is equally important to them and that its security should be a joint Nato responsibility - with the US involved.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To this end, several countries including France,  Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands and the UK have sent a limited number of troops to Greenland in a so-called reconnaissance mission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron said \"land, air, and sea assets\" would soon be sent. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Troops and vessels from European Nato allies arrive in Greenland</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit of the US Congressional comes days after high-level talks in Washington failed to dissuade Trump from his plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The delegation includes senators and members of the US House of Representatives who are fervent supporters of Nato.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Coons and the majority of the delegation are Democratic opponents of Trump, the group includes Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what the elected members of Congress could do to stop Trump, Murkowski said Congress had its role in deciding on spending in the US - a reference to the legislators' ability not to authorise monies for military operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenlandic MP Aaja Chemnitz said the meeting with US legislators had made her \"hopeful\". She told the BBC: \"We need friends. We need allies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the wide gulf between the view of the White House and the position of Greenland and Denmark, she said: \"It's a marathon, not a short sprint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The pressure from the US side is something that we've seen since 2019. It would be naive to think that everything is over now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added: \"It's changing almost hour by hour. So as much support as we can get, the better.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murkowski is one of the sponsors of a bipartisan bill aimed at foiling the annexation of Greenland.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Republican congressman has also introduced a rival bill in support of annexing the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry told Fox News on Friday that the US should talk with Greenland's leaders, not Denmark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do believe that there's a deal that should and will be made once this plays out,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The president is serious. I think he's laid the markers down. He's told Denmark what he's looking for, and now it's a matter of having Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio and Vice-President JD Vance make a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The United States has always been a welcoming party.

They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e0jnww2e9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape.

You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also said that \"one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling.

Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861yyqxg4do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a decisive victory</a> . </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-koh-ewe\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Koh Ewe</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

and what that means for sea-level rise.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w15nggj58o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a warming climate</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study is published in the academic journal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady2532\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Science</a>.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It airs on Fox in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son, has ignited a fierce debate about patient safety within Nigeria's healthcare system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the outcry, the health minister has admitted \"systemic challenges\" and announced the creation of a national task force on \"clinical governance and patient safety\" to improve the quality of care and patient safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family of the internationally acclaimed author says her young son, Nkanu Nnamdi, died last week at a private hospital in the main city, Lagos, following a short illness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They allege the child was denied oxygen and excessively sedated, leading to cardiac arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hospital extended its \"deepest sympathies\" but in a statement denied any wrongdoing, stating its treatment met international standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lagos State Government has ordered an investigation into the death, as public outrage spread over the state of healthcare in Africa's most populous country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just days later, anger surged once more after the death of Aisha Umar, a mother of five who ran a business from home, selling incense and fish in the northern city of Kano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her family alleges a pair of

class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>products manager Josephine Obi, 29, recounted how her father died in 2021 at the state-run Lagos University Teaching Hospital after what she says was a surgical error during a routine procedure for a goitre - a lump or swelling at the front of the neck caused by a swollen thyroid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They cut a major artery... it was a very minor surgery,\" Obi told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said a supervising doctor apologised, admitting a mistake had been made. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family chose not to sue to avoid a potentially costly and protracted legal battle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You will just waste money and the case will linger... we just let it go,\" Obi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC sent an email to the hospital seeking comment, but has not yet received a response. The BBC also phoned the numbers listed on the hospital's website, but they failed to go through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Kano, prison facility officer Abdullahi Umar is still mourning his wife, Ummu Kulthum Tukur, who died three years ago at the age of 27 after giving birth to twins at the state-run Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He believes a timely Caesarean section would have saved her life. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was in labour for over 24 hours... she lost a lot of blood and died,\" he said, adding that the hospital still refuses to provide a death certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Efforts to get the hospital to respond were unsuccessful as the spokesperson Hauwa Inuwa told the BBC she was on leave, instead sending the number of another member of staff, which did not work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joe Abah, a former boss of Nigeria's Bureau of Public Service Reforms, claimed on social media platform X how a private hospital in the capital, Abuja, urged him to undergo immediate surgery for an ailment. Unconvinced, he sought further opinions, including consultations abroad, which concluded no surgery was necessary, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Complaints about treatment in Nigeria's private hospitals are rare, although that is where Adichie's son was treated. They generally have a better reputation than government-owned hospitals, but only a minority can afford to go to them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Private hospitals are out of the reach of many Nigerians because they are expensive but without doubt offer better care compared to government-owned hospitals which carry more load and have manpower and equipment issues,\" Dr Fatima Gaya, who works at a public hospital, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many wealthy Nigerians also go abroad for treatment, including President Bola Tinubu and his predecessor, Muhammadu Buhari, who died in a clinic in London in 2025 after he stepped down from office.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1778/live/e38b6300-f225-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"NurPhoto via Getty Images Health officials go house to house to immunize children at Agboyi Ori Omi in Agboyi-Ketu, Lagos, Nigeria, on 11 November 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">NurPhoto via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most Nigerians are forced to rely on state health care</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Mohammad Usman Suleiman, president of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (Nard), told the BBC that the issues were \"systemic\" and that blaming individuals without addressing the wider problems, such as a lack of doctors and equipment, was futile.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Clinical governance needs to be stepped up. In Nigeria, what we have is individuals being blamed for a systemic problem,\" Suleiman told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you take six to seven surgeries... eventually, you are exhausted. No doctor wakes up wanting to harm someone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These concerns are supported by data. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two separate surveys last year - from the African Research Journal of Medical Sciences and NOIPolls - found that around 43% of Nigerians had personally experienced or witnessed a medical error or near-miss. About a third of patients experienced additional injuries from treatment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Medics and analysts say Nigeria has a very low doctor-patient ratio, worsened by a massive \"brain drain\" as health professionals emigrate after being enticed by better working conditions abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Remaining health workers sometimes juggle multiple jobs and often go on strike to demand higher salaries, and improved conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says about 15,000 doctors have left the country in the past five years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://thenigerialawyer.com/nma-raises-alarm-nigerias-doctor-patient-ratio-soars-to-18000-as-emigration-continues/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Its president, Dr Bala Audu, estimates the ratio is now one doctor to 8,000 patients, far lower than the recommended rate of 1: 600.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An imbalance of over 8,000 patients to one doctor increases overload and stress, which leads to mistakes,\" public affairs analyst Ibrahim Saidu told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's health system is buckling under these pressures, Saidu added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chronic underfunding sees the federal government allocate only about 5% of its budget to health, far below the 15% target set in 2001 by the African Union to improve medical services across the continent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announcing the creation of the national health task force, Health Minister Muhammed Ali Pate acknowledged in a statement that \"Nigeria's healthcare system faces systemic challenges\" in delivering consistent quality care and ensuring patient safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The quality deficits are observed at all levels (public and private) with reports of frequent misdiagnoses, inadequate provider-patient interaction, and lack of care continuity,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The minister added that \"the high rates of preventable medical errors, lack of accountability mechanisms, fragmented service delivery, and limited workforce capacity\" had led to calls for stronger national oversight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The task force will oversee, monitor and drive efforts to integrate quality and patient safety into all areas of healthcare delivery nationwide. It will operate for an initial period of 12 months, with the option of a renewal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While this will be welcomed by many Nigerians, they will want to see the results in the country's clinics and hospitals before they can be convinced that no other patients will become tragic symbols of a national crisis.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman wipes her tears while hugging a young girl, as a picture of a soldier can be seen in the background\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in Venezuela</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But we believe that both things can work at the same time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling,\" she said, calling on the country to \"not be afraid of diplomacy\" with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as \"a terrific person\".

More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson said it rejected \"all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,\" they added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a \"new border line\" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a \"dangerous combat zone\" is.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him \"trapped\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Series of deadly incidents around the Yellow Line</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e97kl240lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">had been gathering firewood for their disabled father</a> when they were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times \"beyond the Yellow Line\" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Demolitions and fortification</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction \"may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, the US said the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjw1nxe5pvlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin</a>, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip. But there was no mention of a timeline for the withdrawal, which is linked to the \"demilitarisation\" of Hamas under October's ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In parts of the Strip, the markers have been placed shortly before work began on the construction of temporary Israeli fortifications such as roadblocks and defensive barriers beyond the mapped Yellow Line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Krieg told BBC Verify that the movement of the blocks would eventually allow Israel to turn parts of Gaza into a \"sterilised belt\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In practice, that means the status of land is less about what the ceasefire map says and more about where concrete blocks sit on a given day,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-maha-el-gaml.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Maha El Gaml. </i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

questionable policy from the central bank and testing the legal limits to get it - to Martin Redrado, sitting in Argentina, Donald Trump's stand-off with the Federal Reserve feels surprisingly familiar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado was fired as head of Argentina's central bank in 2010, after he resisted orders by then-President Cristina Kirchner to hand over reserves to help pay off national debts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He fought the decision successfully in court, but eventually resigned in the face of what he told the BBC was \"intolerable\" pressure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, the clash is remembered as one of the early warnings of the economic turmoil that later engulfed Argentina, exposing it to high inflation and a currency plunge from which the country is still recovering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's fight with the Fed has sparked debate about whether the US might be heading in a similar direction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since his return to office last year, Trump has accused the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, of mishandling the economy and driving up debt costs for the government by keeping interest rates too high.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his interventions at the bank have not been limited to social media complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Trump moved to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx275n8gx0ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sack a top policymaker, Lisa Cook</a>, a decision now being challenged at the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Sunday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c801k7rkkd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Powell said the Fed was facing a criminal probe from the Department of Justice</a>, relating to cost overruns at a property renovation - concerns that Powell has dismissed as \"pretext\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Market reaction to the drama has remained muted, which analysts said was a sign that investors expect the bank to be able to continue operating freely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that faith will be tested in the coming weeks, when the Supreme Court is due to hear arguments about Cook's firing and the president is expected to announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he has been surprised to see echoes of his own battle happening in the US, long held up as a global model.</p><p

in the 1970s, including in the US, leading to a wave of global reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extensive academic research has since linked central bank independence to lower inflation over time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say elected officials have too many incentives to try to use bank power to secure an immediate economic boost or satisfy particular constituencies, even if it might hurt the economy over the long run. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But though Trump's pressure on the Fed is unprecedented for the US, the president is hardly the only leader to disregard advice to leave central bankers alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, former Prime Minister Liz Truss attacked the Bank of England, criticising its independence and accusing it of having too much power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study of central banks in 118 countries between 2010 and 2018 found roughly 10% of central banks each year faced pressure from political leaders, like Trump, wanting lower interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive and can deliver a short-term economic boost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressure on central bankers was most likely to emerge in countries with nationalist or populist leaders and was typically followed by higher inflation, says economist Carola Binder, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who conducted the review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cycled through three central bank leaders in three years between 2019 and 2021, as he looked for someone who would execute on his unorthodox view that high interest rates fed inflation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inflation soared past 50%, as the bank bowed to his demands, before he agreed to appoint leaders with more moderate views.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even in countries where central banks resisted the interference, Binder's research found that inflation tended to rise, albeit to a lesser degree, suggesting pressure alone could cause damage.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

suggest inflation expectations in the US remain contained, making the likely significance of the current fight more political than economic, Binder says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she warned: \"That is a possibility for the US - that this could be inflationary.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0

economy was unlikely to face as severe a fallout as smaller nations like Argentina and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some say there are already signs the fight is having consequences, pointing to an 8% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the long term, it can be hard to identify the driver of economic damage - whether it is the loss of central bank independence or other, often related issues, like the erosion of democracy or rule of law, says Carolina Garriga, professor of political science at the University of Essex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says immediate market moves, like a dip in the dollar that followed the announcement of the Fed criminal probe, show investors consider central bank independence an important piece of the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to disentangle but it is not hard to disentangle when it's market reaction to an announcement.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the criminal probe became public, key Wall Street leaders and members of Congress, including some Republicans, have spoken up forcefully in defence of the Fed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Supreme Court, justices have also indicated that they see the bank as different from other arms of government, where they have let Trump's firings proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say they think the Fed will be able to maintain confidence in its policies, noting that it sets interest rates via a committee with 12 members, of whom the president appoints only seven and who each have long, staggered terms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is slight concern,\" says Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics. \"But there's not a switch here that says faith in US institutions has been lost and therefore we're in a downward spiral.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But much of the Fed's reputation for independence is rooted in convention, rather than legal design. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/69/2/sqaf024/8108275\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">global comparisons of central bank independence</a>, as measured by legal features, the Fed ranks in the bottom third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he remained hopeful that the strength of US institutions would prevail, unlike in Argentina, while warning that Trump was running unnecessary risk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump is really defeating himself by having this kind of fight,\" he said. \"He should know better.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family.

By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-rs-7280-crore-scheme-to-promote-manufacturing-of-sintered-rare-earth-permanent-magnets-repm/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Under the scheme</a>, selected manufacturers will receive capital and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year within seven years. The aim is to meet rising domestic demand, which officials expect to double in five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Industry experts warn that money alone will not be enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India today imports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2151394&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">80- 90% of its magnets</a> and related materials from China, which controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing.

Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start,\" says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. \"India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are several research centres, he points out, which can be put to the task. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8U3-4liOI\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">facility</a> was inaugurated in 2023 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2022185&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plant</a> backed by public and private partners aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of magnets a year by 2030. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But neither has yet reported output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Yet it accounts for less than 1% of global mining. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only one mine is operational in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and until recently most of its output was exported to Japan under a bilateral deal. (In June 2025, however, India <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-moves-conserve-its-rare-earths-seeks-halt-japan-exports-sources-say-2025-06-13/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reportedly</a> asked the state miner, IREL, to suspend these exports to safeguard supplies for domestic needs.)</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Corbis via Getty Images Four engineers wearing beige shirts and yellow helmets stand on the shores of a beach in Kerala where rare earth traces were found\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Corbis via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most of India's rare earth reserves are found in sands along its coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be fair, India is actively working to expand mining and processing operations. For instance, it has set up the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) under which it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2097309&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">pledged</a> to maintain stockpiles and keep its supply chain resilient.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some  of the elements needed to make magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, it has surpluses of lighter rare earths such as neodymium, but lacks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1914305&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">extractable quantities</a> of heavier elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for many high-performance magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short  - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale,\" Ms Mukherjee explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going,\" Mr Gupta says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think this is certainly better than not having taken the step at all.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
