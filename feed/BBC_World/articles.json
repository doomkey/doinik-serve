They also risk isolating his country even further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of the security cabinet meeting<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>where proposals to take over Gaza City were approved by an \"absolute majority\", Netanyahu gave an interview to Fox News in which he said Israel intended to take full control of Gaza to assure Israel's security, remove Hamas from power and enable the transfer of civilian governance to another party, without giving details. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he suggested that Israel did not want to keep the territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't want to govern it,\" Netanyahu said, in English. \"We don't want to be there as a governing body. We want to hand it over to Arab forces.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He did not give details about possible arrangements or which countries could be involved; still, this was a rare indication of what he might be envisioning for a post-war Gaza.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For now, however, Netanyahu wants an expanded offensive that is likely to see the Israeli military, which says it controls about 75% of the territory, operating in Gaza City and the camps in the central part of the strip, where around one million Palestinians live and the hostages are thought to be held.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The potential operations, which could take months, would mean the mass displacement of people with the potential to worsen the humanitarian crisis there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This could spark fresh condemnation from countries that have expressed anger over the situation in Gaza and urged Israel to end the nearly two-year war, which started as a response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a sign of major divergencies between the political and military leadership, the Israeli army's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, told Netanyahu that the full occupation of Gaza was \"tantamount to walking into a trap\", according to reports in Israeli media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zamir, the reports said, warned that the offensive would endanger the lives of the 20 hostages who are believed to be alive as well as of<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>soldiers, who are exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many of the hostage families share those concerns, and say the only way to guarantee the release of the hostages is through a negotiated deal with Hamas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the Maariv newspaper, the \"prevailing assessment is that most and possibly all of the living hostages [will] die\" during an expanded offensive, either killed by their captors or accidentally by Israeli soldiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speculation over an expanded offensive have also exposed divergences between some of Israel's international allies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The British ambassador to Israel, Simon Walter, said the full occupation of Gaza would be a \"huge mistake\", while also pushing back against US and Israeli allegations that a possible recognition of Palestinian statehood by the UK was a reward for Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the US envoy, Mike Huckabee, a staunch supporter of Israel, said it was up to the Israeli government to decide whether to fully take over the Strip. \"It's not our job to tell them what they should or should not do,\" he told CBS News, the BBC's news partner in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Netanyahu has, so far, failed to offer a vision for Gaza after the war apart from refusing to accept a governing role for the Palestinian Authority, the body that governs the occupied West Bank and recognises Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Polls suggest most of the Israeli public favours a deal with Hamas for the release of the hostages and the end of the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli leaders say Hamas, for now, is not interested in negotiating as, in their view, the group is feeling emboldened by the international pressure on Israel. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The threat of a full occupation could be part of a strategy to try to force the group into making concessions in stalled talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But many here believe that Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee the survival of his coalition, which relies on the support of ultranationalist ministers who have threatened to quit the government if there is any deal with Hamas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have also publicly defended expelling Palestinians from Gaza - which could amount to the forced displacement of civilians, a war crime - and resettling it with Jews.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's health ministry, which is run by Hamas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Hamas 7 October attacks on Israel killed about 1,200 people, while 251 were taken to Gaza as hostages.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Deadly aerial strikes are a nightly occurrence across the country, while Russia's refineries and energy facilities come under regular attack from Kyiv's drones. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is against this backdrop that the Kremlin confirmed a meeting between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin was being planned and due to take place soon. \"I'm here to get [the war] over with,\" the US leader said on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine held at his behest between May and July have failed to bring the two sides any closer to peace, and Trump may hope that taking the situation into his own hands could finally result in a ceasefire.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the gulf between Kyiv and Moscow is so large that even Trump-mediated talks could make it difficult to bridge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a memorandum presented to the Ukrainians by Russia in June, Moscow outlined its maximalist demands for a \"final settlement\" of the conflict.

Its president Claudio Pica said letters had been sent to Immediate Media, the site's owner, and UK ambassador Edward Llewellyn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Pica said: \"This iconic dish, traditionally from Rome and the Lazio region, has been a staple of Italian cuisine for years, so much so it has been replicated even beyond Italy's borders.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He regretted contradicting the British site, but clarified that \"the original recipe for cacio e pepe excludes parmesan and butter. There are not four ingredients, but three: pasta, pepper and pecorino\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The furore has been widely covered in Italian media, with a journalist at public broadcaster RAI saying: \"We are always told, you are not as good as the BBC… and then they go and do this. Such a grave mistake. The suggestion of adding some cream gave me goosebumps.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Good Food food brand was owned by BBC Studios (the BBC's commercial wing) until 2018, when it was sold to Immediate Media Co - with the BBC prefix being dropped from its name last year. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"It's terrible!\" says pasta restaurant owner Giorgio Erami</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While some chefs may experiment with the dish, the main concern is that the website misled readers by presenting its version as the original. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Italians often mock foreigners for their interpretation of their recipes, but the indignation in this case is about something deeper: tampering with tradition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Maurizio and Loredana run a hotel in central Rome - it's been in their family for four generations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can do all the variations in the world – but you cannot use the original Italian name for them, said Maurizio. \"You cannot say it is cacio e pepe if you put butter, oil and cream in it. Then it becomes something else.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added: \"You have to yield to Caesar that which is Caesar's!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Giorgio Eramo runs a fresh pasta restaurant near St Peter's square - serving up cacio e pepe and other traditional pasta dishes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's terrible. It's not cacio e pepe... What Good Food published, with butter and parmesan, is called 'pasta Alfredo'. It's another kind of pasta,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On his restaurant's board of pastas, he offers cacio e pepe with lime - a variation. But he says that's ok.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's different, it's for the summer, to make the pasta more fresh. But it doesn't impact the tradition. It's not like cream or butter. Lime is just a small change.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Eleonora says Italians are upset because much of the country's tradition is based on food</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nicola, who runs a sandwich shop near the Vatican, took particular issue with the inclusion of cream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Cacio e pepe should not be made with cream; cream is for desserts. For heaven's sake. Whoever uses cream does not know what cooking means.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Italians often get angry when foreigners tinker with their food recipes - pizza with pineapple, cappuccino after midday or carbonara with cream, for example.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Eleonora, who works at a busy cafe in central Rome, thinks it is probably not necessary for Italians to get so angry about something like this, but understands why they do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Our tradition is based on food. So if you touch the only thing that we have, in all over the world… that can make us feel a bit sad.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Good Food owners Immediate Media has been approached for comment.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

One of his key pledges as he returned to the White House in January was to cut the trade deficit - the shortfall between what America buys and what it sells. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">His tariffs work by charging US importers a tax on goods they buy from other countries. Those importers may pass some or all of the extra cost on to customers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has also been accused of throwing the global economy into turmoil in recent months, though markets have recently been more stable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The overall average US tariff rate is at its highest in almost a century, thanks to a range of other industry-specific taxes affecting products such as vehicles and steel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The duties that came into effect on Thursday were first announced in April. Many were later paused amid market turbulence, and to give other countries time to strike new trade deals with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A patchwork of rates were set for different countries - and were adjusted over time by Trump, who ultimately set a negotiating deadline of 7 August. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Export-dependent economies in South East Asia are among the hardest-hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Manufacturing-focused Laos and Myanmar face some of the highest levies at 40%. Some experts said Trump appears to have targeted countries with close trade ties with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But after more than four months of uncertainty, markets in Asia seemed to take the news in their stride on Thursday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Major share indexes in Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and mainland China were a little higher, while markets in India and Australia were lower.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest set of tariffs will offer countries some stability after months of chaos, said economist Bert Hofman from the National University of Singapore.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is supposed to be it,\" he said. \"Now you can start to analyse the impact of the tariffs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some major economies - including the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">UK</a>, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v9q8e0vjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Japan</a> and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxpvl9krxwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">South Korea</a> - reached agreements to ensure goods exported to the US would face a lower tariff rate than Trump threatened in April.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14g8gk8vdlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">European Union</a> has also struck a framework deal with Washington, in which Brussels has accepted a 15% tariff on goods from the trading bloc.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Switzerland has said it will hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday after its officials were unable to reach a deal with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 39%, the tariff rate on Swiss goods is one of the highest imposed by the US, and threatens to hit the country's economy hard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Taiwan, a key Washington ally in Asia, was handed a 20% tariff. Its president Lai Ching-te said the rate was \"temporary\" and that talks with the US were ongoing.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Other tariffs unveiled by Trump after he returned to the White House in January have been aimed at the US's top three trading partners - China, Canada and Mexico - with a variety of political goals in mind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, he boosted the tariff rate on Canada from 25% to 35%, saying the country had \"failed to cooperate\" in curbing the flow of fentanyl and other drugs across the US border. Canada insists it is cracking down on drug gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But most Canadian exports to the US will dodge the import tax due to an existing trade treaty, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Higher tariffs on Mexico were paused for another 90 days as negotiations continue to strike a trade deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the US and China have held a series of talks in a bid to agree an extension to a 90-day tariffs pause due to expire on 12 August.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of Trump's recent tariff moves have been bound up with a separate effort to end Russia's war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has threatened to impose \"secondary tariffs\" aimed at Moscow's trading partners if a ceasefire with Ukraine is not agreed by Friday, although it is unclear whether positive noises following talks between Washington and Moscow and a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr5rdl1y8ndo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">potential meeting between Trump and Putin</a> will affect this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the interim, Trump threatened on Wednesday to raise the tariff rate on Indian goods to 50% from 27 August, as he pushes the world's third largest importer of energy to stop buying oil from Russia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable\" and vowed to protect its national interests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The move marked a \"sharp change\" in Trump's approach to Moscow that could spark concerns among other countries in talks with the US, said market analyst Farhan Badami from financial services firm eToro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There is the possibility here that India is only the first target that Trump intends to punish for maintaining trade relations with Russia,\" Mr Badami said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Also on Wednesday, Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That threat came as tech firm Apple announced a new $100bn (£75bn) US investment after coming under pressure from the White House to move more production to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Major chipmakers that have made significant investments in the US appear to be able to dodge the new tariff. Government officials in Taiwan and South Korea have said in separate statements that TSMC, SK Hynix, and Samsung would be exempt from the new levy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House did not immediately respond to a BBC request for clarification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The BBC has also contacted SK Hynix and Samsung. TSMC declined to comment.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

The regions of Sicilia and Calabria are two of the poorest in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the project will still need to be rubber-stamped by the Italian Court of Auditors as well as environmental agencies, both at national and EU level.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local residents on either side of the strait whose properties may be expropriated will also have to be consulted and could legally challenge the decision, meaning the construction of the bridge may be delayed or stall altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It would not be the first time that the bridge's building has been held up. Since the first plans for it were drawn up more than 50 years ago, various ideas for it have had to be shelved for various reasons and it has long faced stern opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has included concerns that huge amounts of taxpayers' money would be siphoned off by the Sicilian and Calabrian mafias, which have a broad influence over politics and society in southern Italy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, local politicians reiterated their unhappiness with the government's decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Nicola Irto of the Democratic Party (PD) called the project was \"controversial and divisive\", saying it would divert \"crucial resources from local transportation, modern infrastructure, safe schools and quality healthcare facilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Giusy Caminiti, the mayor of Villa San Giovanni near where the bridge would be built on the Calabrian shore, said her town would be badly affected and urged more time for consultations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Grassroots Calabrian committee \"No to the Bridge\" slammed Wednesday's announcement and said it was a political manoeuvre, rather than the outcome of a thorough technical evaluation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local groups that oppose the bridge also say its construction would use millions of litres of water a day while both Sicily and Calabria regularly struggle with drought. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently the only way for trains to cross the Strait is to have the coaches shunted onto ferries and carried over the sea in a 30-minute journey. </p></div></div></body></html>"

He did not offer more details on the new tariff plan, but said other companies could similarly avoid the taxes if they invest in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Standing alongside Trump, Mr Cook, who personally donated $1m to Trump's inaugural committee, said the company's initial $500bn domestic investment was \"already yielding results\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The new funding \"will spur even more production right here in America for critical components used in Apple products all around the world\", the CEO said. </p></div><figure><div

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Cook also presented Trump with a glass statue, which he assembled in the Oval Office's Resolute Desk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Analysts said any significant change to Apple's supply chain would take time, but the company's promise might help it win lighter treatment from the White House, given Trump's focus on increasing business investments in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shares surged more than 5% on Wednesday after the news.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement on Wednesday, the White House said the firm's latest pledge was a sign that Trump's policies were convincing companies to put more money into the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" a White House spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Apple has long made the bulk of its products in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It avoided duties during Trump's first term after agreeing to invest more in America, in announcements that it coordinated with the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it has been scrambling since Trump launched a new tariff war in January, announcing an additional 30% levy on Chinese-made goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Apple has responded to changes by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reworking its supply chain</a>, shipping goods to the US primarily <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykd997kjjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">from India and Vietnam</a>, which face lower tariffs on their exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the company still paid out more than $800m in new border taxes on its products over the three months ended in June, reflecting Trump's sweeping global so-called reciprocal tariffs, which have been in place since April. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is expecting to pay another $1.1bn in coming months, despite exemptions from the measures that the White House granted to certain electronics in April. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With tariffs on Indian-made goods now set to ramp up to 50%, it has raised tariff worries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On a call with investors, Mr Cook emphasised Apple's involvement in the US, and its longstanding strategy of working with \"third parties\" to make investments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He pointed to its previously announced plans to launch a \"manufacturing academy\" in Michigan,<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>as well its pledge to buy $500m in rare earth magnets from MP Materials, which is working to expand production of rare earths in the US. The US government has taken a stake in that company as well, while committing to a minimum price for its output. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since his return to office, Trump has often promoted high-profile commitments of investments by firms like Apple. Analysts say the numbers he uses often appear exaggerated and there is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clynl129kd2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">no evidence yet of a wider trend</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight, praised Mr Cook for deft navigation of Apple through \"turbulent times\" but said it remained to be seen what the investment would mean for the many different pieces that go into Apple devices and where they are produced. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Certainly if you look at the case today, it's impossible to think now everything could just suddenly be produced, manufactured and put together in the US overnight,\" he said. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Paul Biya</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 92, Paul Biya is the world's oldest serving head of state. He has been in power for nearly 43 years since 1982. Biya leads the ruling CPDM party which dominates the political scene. He is widely considered the favourite, now that his main rival, Kamto, is out of the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The veteran politician has never lost an election since the return of multi-party politics in 1990. However, his victories have been marred by allegations of vote rigging – claims which his party and the government have continuously denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Announcing his intention to run, Biya said his eighth mandate would focus on the wellbeing of women and young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"2.-bello-bouba-maigari\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">2. Bello Bouba Maigari</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Bello Bouba Maigari, 78, is an experienced politician who hails from Cameroon's vote-rich northern region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He is the president of the National Union for Democracy and Progress (NUDP) party founded in 1990. He served in the governments of both of Cameroon's presidents -Ahmadou Ahidjo and Paul Biya. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In fact, he was Biya's first prime minister between 1982 and 1983. Since 1997, Maigari has forged an alliance with Biya's CPDM party that helped the latter clinch significant votes from the north. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, this political marriage ended in June following pressure from within his party to run independently. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While serving as Minister of State for Tourism and Leisure, Maigari announced his resignation and declared himself a candidate against Biya, who he also faced in the 1992 presidential election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"3.-issa-tchiroma-bakary\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">3. Issa Tchiroma Bakary</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another former Biya ally whose candidacy came as a surprise is 75-year-old Issa Tchiroma Bakary. Like Maigari, he is from the country's north and has been influential in helping Biya secure the region's votes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">After a 20-year stint in different government roles, Tchiroma finally pulled the plug on his time with the 92-year-old leader, resigning from his role as Minister of Employment and Vocational Training to announce his candidacy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Tchiroma, who heads the Cameroon National Salvation Front (CNSF) party, criticised Biya's governance style and hinged his presidential bid on a promise to overhaul the system, which he described as \"suffocating\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7233/live/5f3413b0-73a2-11f0-98d8-b14683e68fab.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A man painted in green and white colours \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Supporters of Joshua Osih came out in donned in party colours when he campaigned in the 2018 election, but he came fourth</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"4.-cabral-libii\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">4.

This time around, Muna, a staunch international anti-corruption lawyer, says he wants to challenge Biya himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 72-year-old is from a family of politicians - his late father Solomon Tandeng Muna served as Prime Minister of West Cameroon after independence, Vice-President of the then Federal Republic of Cameroon and Speaker of the National Assembly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As Speaker, Solomon Muna swore in Biya when he took over as president after Ahmadou Ahidjo resigned. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Muna is promising to rid the bilingual country of the corruption and bad governance that he says have soiled its image at the international scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><b id=\"6.-joshua-osih\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\">6.

Since becoming a member of parliament in the process, he has challenged the government on key policy issues, promising sweeping changes if he takes over the reins of power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Dr Hugues says Libii's vision is opaque, citing Akere Muna as a more convincing candidate with a much clearer project for the nation of nearly 30 million people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Muna has a wealth of international experience and diplomatic character, and that is what the nation needs now,\" he said, while praising the renowned lawyer's five-year transition plan to \"put the nation back on track\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Could the opposition unite?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Historically, Cameroon's opposition has been fragmented especially during elections, with analysts saying this has disadvantaged them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ahead of this year's presidential election, there has been much talk about the need for the opposition to unite and harmonise strategies to take on Biya.

The treated water was by definition safe to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The problem was that under EU law, \"natural mineral water\" – which sells at a huge premium over tap water – is supposed to be unaltered between the underground source and the bottle. That is the whole point of it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If brands like Evian, Vichy and Perrier have been so successful in France and around the world, it is thanks to an appealing image of mountain-sides, rushing streams, purity and health-giving minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Admit filtering the water, and the industry risks breaking the market spell.  Consumers might begin to ask what they'd been paying for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Complicating matters for Perrier and its parent company Nestlé – as well as President Emmanuel Macron's government – is the charge that executives and ministers conspired to keep the affair quiet, covered up reports of contamination, and re-wrote the rules so that Perrier could continue using micro-filtration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In their investigations, Le Monde and Radio France alleged that the government considered the mineral water industry so strategic that it agreed to suppress damaging information. A senate inquiry into the affair accused the government of a \"deliberate strategy\" of \"dissimulation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Responding to the allegations, the government has asked the European Commission to rule on what level of micro-filtration is permissible for \"natural mineral water\".

And if Perrier is feeling the impact ahead of other companies, it is probably because its geographical location sets it apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Far from the remote mountain landscape you might imagine, Perrier's water is pumped from deep aquifers in the coastal plain between Nîmes and Montpellier, a short drive from the Mediterranean. The area is populous, heavily-farmed, and very hot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"There has been a big climatic shift since 2017,\" says Haziza. \"For five years there was a succession of droughts, which were particularly badly felt in the south.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Emma Haziza says climate change is causing a lot of problems in the south of France</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All the aquifers were affected. This means not just the upper water-table, which is where everyday tap water comes from. We can now see that the deeper aquifers – which the companies thought were protected – are also being hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The unforeseen is taking place. We are moving from a period in which companies could draw water from the deep aquifers and be sure they would be replenished, to a period in which it's obvious the whole system cannot go on.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The analysis made by Haziza and other hydrologists is that there is now a clear link between deeper and surface aquifers. Contaminants (farm chemicals or human waste) that drain off the land in the increasingly frequent flash floods, can now make their way into the lower aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the same time, the effects of long-term drought and over-pumping mean these lower aquifers contain less volume, so any contamination will be more concentrated, the experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We can foresee that what has happened first at Perrier's site will happen to other producers in the years to come. That's why we need to move away from our current model of consumption,\" says Haziza.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong insists their water is \"100%\" pure</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year at the Perrier site, three million bottles had to be destroyed because of a contamination. But the company insists that any problems are swiftly detected; and it disputes the claim that contaminants are entering the deep aquifers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are pumping water from 130 metres underground, beneath layers of limestone,\" says Perrier hydrologist Jérémie Pralong. \"We are 100% convinced of the purity of the water. And its mineral make-up is constant.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says there is no EU ruling that specifically bans micro-filtration. The relevant text simply says that nothing must be done to disinfect or alter the mineral make-up of the water. The argument is over at what measure of micro-filtration alteration begins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The original Perrier source was first tapped by a local doctor in the 1860s, but it was under British management that the brand took off 50 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">St John Harmsworth – brother of newspaper magnates Lords Northcliffe and Rothermere – made Perrier a byword for mineral water across the British empire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to company lore, Harmsworth took inspiration for the bottles' bulbous shape from the Indian clubs he used for exercise following a crippling car accident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Today the bottling plant at Vergèze is still next to Harmsworth's residence and the original source. The plant has been heavily automated. A rail track connects with the SNCF network to bring hundreds of millions of cans and bottles every year to Marseille for export.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Perrier's bottling plant is still next to the water's original source at Vergèze</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The focus for the last year has been on a new brand: Maison Perrier. These energy and flavoured drinks are proving highly successful in France and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The advantage for Perrier is that the new beverages do not claim to be \"natural mineral water\". They can be treated and filtered without difficulty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perrier says the new brand is part of the mix, and that it has no intention of abandoning its original Source Perrier natural mineral water. It has stopped the ultra-fine (0.2 micron) microfiltration, and now uses a 0.45 micron system which has been agreed with government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It has applied for \"natural mineral water\" status for just two out of the five drilling wells it was using for Perrier mineral water. A decision is due later this year.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsletters/zhp28xs\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Sign up here.</a></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Israel regularly identifies and targets Hamas salary distributors, seeking to disrupt the group's ability to govern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Employees, from police officers to tax officials, often receive an encrypted message on their own phones or their spouses' instructing them to go to a specific location at a specific time to \"meet a friend for tea\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the meeting point, the employee is approached by a man - or occasionally a woman - who discreetly hands over a sealed envelope containing the money before vanishing without further interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An employee at the Hamas Ministry of Religious Affairs, who doesn't want to give his name for safety reasons, described the dangers involved in collecting his wages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time I go to pick up my salary, I say goodbye to my wife and children. I know that I may not return,\" he said. \"On several occasions, Israeli strikes have hit the salary distribution points. I survived one that targeted a busy market in Gaza City.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Alaa, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, is a schoolteacher employed by the Hamas-run government and the sole provider for a family of six.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I received 1,000 shekels (about $300) in worn-out banknotes - no trader would accept them. Only 200 shekels were usable - the rest, I honestly don't know what to do with,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"After two-and-a-half months of hunger, they pay us in tattered cash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm often forced to go to aid distribution points in the hope of getting some flour to feed my children. Sometimes I succeed in bringing home a little, but most of the time I fail.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March the Israeli military said they had killed the head of Hamas's finances, Ismail Barhoum, in a strike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. They accused him of channelling funds to Hamas's military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It remains unclear how Hamas has managed to continue funding salary payments given the destruction of much of its administrative and financial infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One senior Hamas employee, who served in high positions and is familiar with Hamas's financial operations, told the BBC that the group had stockpiled approximately $700m in cash and hundreds of millions of shekels in underground tunnels prior to the group's deadly 7 October 2023 attack in southern Israel, which sparked the devastating Israeli military campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These were allegedly overseen directly by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed - both of whom have since been killed by Israeli forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Anger at reward for Hamas supporters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas has historically relied on funding from heavy import duties and taxes imposed on Gaza's population, as well as receiving millions of dollars of support from Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing which operates through a separate financial system, is financed mainly by Iran. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A senior official from the banned Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, one of the most influential Islamist organisations in the world, has said that around 10% of their budget was also directed to Hamas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In order to generate revenue during the war, Hamas has also continued to levy taxes on traders and has sold large quantities of cigarettes at inflated prices up to 100 times their original cost. Before the war, a box of 20 cigarettes cost $5 - that has now risen to more than $170.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to cash payments, Hamas has distributed food parcels to its members and their families via local emergency committees whose leadership is frequently rotated due to repeated Israeli strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That has fuelled public anger, with many residents in Gaza accusing Hamas of distributing aid only to its supporters and excluding the wider population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid that has entered Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year, something Hamas denies. However BBC sources in Gaza have said that significant quantities of aid were taken by Hamas during this time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nisreen Khaled, a widow left caring for three children after her husband died of cancer five years ago, told the BBC: \"When the hunger worsened, my children were crying not only from pain but also from watching our Hamas-affiliated neighbours receive food parcels and sacks of flour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Are they not the reason for our suffering?

Now that looks increasingly difficult, if not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So what went wrong?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A series of missteps, grandstanding, geopolitics and domestic political pressure seem to have broken down the negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi has been restrained in its response so far to Trump's tirades, hoping that diplomacy might eventually help secure a trade deal. But in Trump's White House, there are no guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has commented on many issues that Delhi considers red lines.

He went as far as saying that some day, Pakistan might sell oil to India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another constant irritant for Delhi is Trump's repeated assertion that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India sees its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as its internal affair and has always rejected third-party mediation on the issue. Most world leaders have been sensitive to Delhi's position, including Trump in his first stint as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that's no longer the case. The US president has doubled down on his claim even after Modi told India's parliament that \"no country had mediated in the ceasefire\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi didn't name Trump or the US but domestic political pressure is mounting on him not to \"bow down\" to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The fact that this is happening against the backdrop of heavy and high-level US engagement with Islamabad immediately after an India-Pakistan conflict is even more galling for Delhi and the wider Indian public. This all sharpens concerns harboured by some in India that the US can't truly be trusted as a partner,\" says Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that some of the anger in Delhi might \"be Cold War-era baggage coming to the fore\", but \"this time around it's intensified by real-time developments as well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi's government thrives on nationalist issues, so its supporters would likely expect a firm response to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a Catch-22 situation - Delhi still wants to clinch a deal but also doesn't want to come across as buckling under Trump's pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it appears that Delhi is gradually releasing the restraint. In its response to Washington's anger over India's purchase of Russian oil, Delhi vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard its \"national interests and economic security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question is why Trump, who loved India's hospitality and called it a great country earlier, has gone on a tirade against a trusted ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts see his insults as a pressure tactic to secure a deal that he thinks works for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is a real estate magnate and a tough negotiator.

How Delhi reacts will decide the future of the India-US relationship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has been measured in its response so far but is not holding back completely. In its statement, it said that the US had encouraged it to keep buying oil from Russia for global energy market stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also said that targeting it was unjustified as the EU continues to buy energy, fertiliser, mining and chemical products from Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things seem bad, some analysts say that all is not lost. India and the US have close links in many sectors, which can't be uprooted overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries cooperate closely in the space technology, IT, education and defence sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many large domestic IT firms have invested heavily in the US, and most big Silicon Valley firms have operations in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think the fundamentals of the relationship are not weak. It's a paradox that the day Trump announced 25% tariffs and unspecified penalties, India and the US collaborated in a strategic area when an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy98jnreqvvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Indian rocket sent a jointly-developed satellite into space</a>,\" says Mr Misra. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It will be interesting to see how India reacts to Trump's sharp rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is unapologetically transactional and commercial in his approach to foreign policy. He has no compunction about deploying these potentially alienating harsh tactics against a close US partner like India,\" says Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he adds that there's a lot of trust baked into the partnership, given the work that has gone into it over the past two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So what's lost can potentially be regained.

At any time, one strain will be in the ascendancy and be the most likely to cause trouble in winter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In flu, the inactivated flu injection that is given to adults is updated every year - as is the live vaccine that is given to children as a nasal spray. A future mRNA form of flu vaccine would work the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The point about keeping up with variants is about all technologies, not just mRNA,\" says Prof Pollard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">mRNA is 'streets ahead' when speed is needed</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a legitimate scientific question about which vaccine technology is used for which disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What is causing concern among scientists is that pulling mRNA research means we will not have those vaccines at times when we need to do what no other technology can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard says: \"I don't think there's the evidence they are hugely better for protection, but where RNA tech is streets ahead of everything else is responding to outbreaks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The world is highly drilled at making new flu vaccines each year. But even then, there is a six-month process of deciding on the new flu strains to be targeted, growing the vaccine at scale in chicken eggs and then distributing it. Brand new vaccines take even longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But with mRNA, you can have the new vaccine in six to eight weeks, and then tens or hundreds of millions of doses a few months later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the projects that have had their funding pulled in the US were preparing for a bird flu pandemic. That virus, H5N1, has been devastating bird populations and jumping into a wide range of other animals including American cattle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That doesn't make sense and if we do get a human pandemic of bird flu it could be seen as a catastrophic error,\" says Prof Finn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the ramifications of the US turning away from mRNA research could be felt more widely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What impact does this move have on confidence in the current vaccines, mRNA or otherwise? How does it affect the world when the US is one of the most influential countries in medical research? And will it have a knock-on impact on other types of mRNA technology, such as cancer vaccines - or using the approach to treat rare genetic diseases?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard poses another question after RFK Jr's move: \"Does it put us all at risk if a huge market is turning its back on RNA?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is one of the most important technologies we'll see this century in infectious disease, biotherapeutic agents for rare disease and critically for cancer. It's a message I'm troubled about.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
