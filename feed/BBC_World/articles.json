He represented continuity for the Cuban revolution as much as the Venezuelan one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now he, too, is gone from the seat of power in Caracas, forcibly removed by the US's  elite Delta Force team. The prospects for Cuba in his absence are bleak.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the Cuban government has robustly denounced the attack as illegal and declared two days of national mourning for <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj9r0eyw0jno\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">32 Cuban nationals killed in the US military operation. </a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their deaths revealed a key fact long-known about Cuban influence over the Venezuelan presidency and military: Maduro's security detail was almost entirely made up of Cuban bodyguards.

Cuba was already in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the Cold War.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have been rolling blackouts from end to end of the island for months. And the impact on ordinary Cubans has been taxing in the extreme: weeks without reliable electricity, food rotting in fridges, fans and air-conditioning not running, mosquitoes swarming in the heat and the fester of uncollected rubbish.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island has experienced a widespread outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases in recent weeks with huge numbers of people affected by dengue fever and chikungunya. Cuba's healthcare system, once the jewel in the revolution's crown, has struggled to cope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not a pretty picture. Yet it is the daily reality for most Cubans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea that the flow of Venezuelan oil to Cuba could be turned off by Delcy Rodríguez fills Cubans with dread, especially if she looks to placate the Trump administration following the US raid against her predecessor and stave off the spectre of more violence.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9ad1/live/908bf880-ea79-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA/Shutterstock Venezuelans in Miami, Florida, hold a picture of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during a rally in support of the US operation in Venezuela.

Rubio used that very term - backyard - about the region as he justified the actions against Venezuela on US Sunday talk shows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also remains key to what comes next for Cuba. The US economic embargo has been in place for more than six decades and failed to remove the Castro brothers or their political project from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio - a Cuban American former Florida senator and son of Cuban exiles - would like nothing more than to be the man, or the man behind the man, who brought an end to 60 years of communist rule in his parents' homeland. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He sees the strategy of removing Maduro and laying down stark conditions to a more compliant Rodríguez government in Caracas as the key to achieving that self-professed goal in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba has faced tough times in the past, and the government remains defiant in the face of this latest act of US military intervention in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 32 \"brave Cuban combatants\" who died in Venezuela would be honoured, said Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel, for \"taking on the terrorists in imperial uniforms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Cuba is ready to fall,\" retorted Trump on Air Force One.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He is set to meet China's Premier Li Qiang and the chairman of parliament, Zhao Leji on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It marks the first visit by a South Korean leader since 2019. Bilateral ties had soured under Lee's predecessor, impeached ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was very critical of China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi, meanwhile, has appeared keen to shore up ties with South Korea amid a diplomatic row between China and Japan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea is a US security ally - like Japan - but also relies on China for trade. Experts say Lee is expected to keep walking a diplomatic tightrope between Beijing and Tokyo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit marks the second time the two leaders have met since November when Xi visited South Korea for a regional economic summit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday Lee stated that the visit was \"a crucial opportunity\" for the \"full-scale

\"firmly stand on the right side of history and make correct strategic choices\", China's official Xinhua news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also brought up the two

North Korea diplomatically, but there has been little progress so far.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He needs Chinese cooperation in pressuring the North's Kim Jong Un to give up his nuclear weapons. Beijing is one of Pyongyang's biggest supporters, economically and diplomatically.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee vowed on Monday to work with China on \"viable alternatives for peace on the Korean Peninsula\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Seoul's military said Pyongyang fired ballistic missiles off its east coast. And on Monday the North's state news agency said the country test-fired hypersonic missiles to assess deterrence capabilities following recent developments, in an apparent reference to the US's seizure of Maduro.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains unclear how much Lee will be able to push China on North Korea. In September, Xi had pledged to strengthen Beijing's \"traditional friendship\" with Pyongyang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Seoul and Beijing are not natural allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US troops have been stationed in South Korea for decades in case of an attack from the North, and last year the two sides agreed to cooperate on building nuclear-powered submarines. The announcement drew warnings from China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee has also sought to put a stop to China's build-up of maritime structures in waters between the two countries. Beijing says the structures are fish-farming equipment, but they have sparked security concerns in Seoul.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders agreed on Monday to continue \"constructive\" dialogue on the matter, South Korea's presidential spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another item high on Lee's agenda is<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>China's unofficial restrictions on South Korean music and dramas that have been in place for a decade. K-pop and K-dramas are either unavailable or difficult to access on Chinese media platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While China has never acknowledged a ban on Korean artists, it's believed to be a protest against South Korea's decision to deploy a US anti-missile system in 2016, which China sees as a threat to its military operations in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is a massive market for Korean entertainment, which is already a huge global success.                                                        </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a Korea-China business forum on Sunday, Lee encouraged deeper bilateral collaboration in beauty products, food and cultural content including movies and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A South Korean presidential spokesperson said on Monday that the two leaders agreed to discuss the gradual expansion of cultural exchanges - without specifying concrete commitments on K-dramas or K-pop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson similarly told reporters on Tuesday that both sides have agreed to \"carry out orderly, healthy, and beneficial cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking before Korean residents in Beijing on Sunday, Lee said his visit would \"serve as a new starting point to fill in the gaps in Korea-China relations, restore them to normal and upgrade them to a new level\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The UN estimates that about half the population is dependent on humanitarian aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2013, the landlocked country has been mired in conflict after rebels seized power, ousting then-President François Bozizé. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2019 peace deal between the government and 14 armed groups helped ease tensions, though six of the groups later withdrew from the agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say Touadéra's win could bolster the interests of Russia, which has provided security assistance in exchange for access to resources such as gold and diamonds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CAR was one of the first African countries where Wagner, a Russian mercenary group, became active, providing security to Touadéra.</p></div></div></body></html>"

One stood outside the van and kept an eye on the surroundings while the other raped the woman inside the van,\" Yashpal Yadav, public relations officer of Faridabad police, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police had questioned the suspects, who were later produced in court and sent to prison, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor at the hospital where the survivor was treated had said that the woman was brought in \"at around 05:30 on 30 December... she had a lot of injuries\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shalini Chopra, a social worker and an opposition politician, who spoke to the survivor after she was discharged from the hospital told the BBC that the woman was \"better but still in pain\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case has provoked anger and outrage in India and drawn comparisons with the horrific gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in Delhi in December 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That crime had made global headlines, led to huge protests in Delhi and several other cities and forced the government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws that included the death penalty for the most gruesome attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51969961\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">were hanged</a> in 2020. One of the rapists died in prison while a juvenile was freed after spending time in a reform centre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite the heightened scrutiny of sexual crimes since then, tens of thousands of rapes and sexual assaults continue to be reported every year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to latest police records, 29,670 rapes and 2,796 attempted rapes were reported in 2023. In addition, police also recorded 849 cases of child rapes and 94 cases of attempted rapes of children.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The argument used by the appeals court in clearing them was that saying someone had changed gender was not necessarily an \"attack on their honour\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Macrons are now taking that case to the high court of appeal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The most important things are the prevention courses and the suspension of some of the accounts\" of the perpetrators, Jean Ennochi, Brigitte Macron's lawyer, said after the verdict was handed down, the AFP news agency reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tiphaine Auzière, Brigitte Macron's daughter from a previous marriage, previously told the trial that the cyber-bullying had negatively affected her mother's health and living conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said her mother \"has had to be careful about her choices of outfits, of posture... she knows perfectly well that her image will be used to back these theories\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While her mother had \"learned to live with it\", Auzière said, she suffered from the repercussions on her grandchildren who were taunted at school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's ruling in France is a forerunner of a much bigger trial due in the US, where the Macrons have filed a defamation lawsuit against right-wing influencer Candace Owens, who has also voiced conspiracy theories about the first lady's gender. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They alleged that she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owens has regularly repeated the claims on her podcast and social media channels, and in March 2024 stated that she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on her belief that the first lady \"is in fact a man\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The presidential couple were initially advised that the best course was to ignore the online gossip, because to go to law would simply amplify it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But last year there was a radical change of course. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Macrons decided that the scale of the online attacks was now too large to ignore. So, at risk of exposing their private selves in a US court, they determined to push back against the conspiracy theorists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A conspiracy theory claiming that Brigitte Macron is a transgender woman has circulated since her husband was first elected in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brigitte Macron first met her now-husband when she was a teacher at his secondary school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple married in 2007, when the future French president was 29 and she was in her mid-50s.</p></div></div></body></html>"

We urge the public to not lose faith and hope in the justice system,\" Mohalaba tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But organisations such as Action Society, which support victims through the legal process, say the justice system is failing people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The system is broken at every step, and sometimes the delays force people to give up.

That felt magical,\" says Nitesh Singh, who is based just outside Delhi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Reddy, he thought that the flower had much more potential in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was here for thousands of years, but nobody knew it could become clean, healthy food,\" adds Singh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, in 2018 he founded Blue Tea, hoping to grow an Indian brand, with Indian butterfly peas. To start with, it did not go well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Initially, we had to import because we couldn't find good quality flowers in India. The flowers here had fewer petals, and once sun-dried, nothing would remain. We needed a flower with more pigment, more petals, to retain colour after drying.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past seven years, Singh has been working with farmers to raise the quantity and quality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having started with five farmers, he now works with 600 across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Training and quality control are the biggest challenges,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plucking the flowers is a key part of the process. It's a job that is predominantly done by women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their hands are softer, and they instinctively know how to pluck delicate flowers without damaging the plant. So, women are trained in how to identify the flower for plucking,\" says Singh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once harvested, the flowers have to be dried, which also has to be done with care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Temperature control is extremely important for drying this flower - one mistake and you lose its value,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farmers do some of the drying before the flowers arrive at Blue Tea, where the moisture is checked and further drying is done.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We use very mild temperatures for a longer time. If the heat is too high, the flower burns and you lose its medicinal quality and colour,\" says Singh.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d248/live/cd6e80f0-d742-11f0-9553-fb7d4b4955e6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Blue Tea A pile of tea bags with a Blue Tea label\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Blue Tea</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Blue Tea has been working with Indian farmers to source butterfly pea flowers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as the eye-catching colour, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6546959/#sec35\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">there is some evidence</a> that butterfly pea flowers have health benefits.

Then came the US special forces operation targeting Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, followed by a second warning on Sunday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such direct and potential threats from a sitting US president, issued while protests are still ongoing, are highly unusual and could embolden demonstrators and encourage the unrest to spread further. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian police and security forces have already responded violently almost from the outset, and reports by human rights groups claim that more than 20 people have already been killed. Now eyes are on Trump's possible move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests, which began peacefully on Sunday 28 December, were initially driven by public anger over soaring inflation and the sharp devaluation of the local currency against the US dollar which now stands at about 80% higher than a year ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's economy is in deep trouble, with little prospect for growth this year or next.

Economic slogans quickly turned political, with calls for the removal of the entire Islamic Republic itself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Students joined the protests, followed by small businesses in other cities and towns and other ordinary Iranians. Within days, chants against Iran's supreme leader once again became a central feature of the demonstrations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last time Iran experienced unrest on a comparable national scale was around four years ago, when the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman in the custody of the morality police sparked the most widespread anti-government protests since the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those demonstrations, which later became known as the \"Mahsa Movement\" or \"Woman, Life, Freedom\", shook the foundations of the state but were eventually suppressed through force and mass arrests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the current protests have spread rapidly and persisted for days, they have not yet reached the scale or intensity of the 2022 demonstrations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Journalists in Iran are under immense pressure, and independent international news organisations are either not allowed to report from inside the country or, if granted permission, face severe restrictions on their movements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result, much of what is known comes from social media and people on the streets sharing what they witness and record. This makes verification increasingly difficult, especially as social media can also provide fertile ground for fabrications, unfounded claims, and distorted realities, a challenge further intensified by the rise of AI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Against this backdrop, many observers believe the present situation could have more serious consequences than 2022.

The fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria deprived Tehran of a key ally, while sustained Israeli attacks on Hezbollah in Lebanon eliminated much of the group's senior leadership. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, US operations in Venezuela and snatching of Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, have further narrowed Iran's options abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These developments have reshaped the regional and international environment for Tehran. Iran now has fewer allies to rely on in regional conflicts and fewer channels to move oil revenues overseas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is particularly significant given Iran's heavy involvement in Venezuela's oil sector alongside Russia, and its reliance on complex financial arrangements linked to markets believed to be in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The disruption of these networks has increased Iran's economic vulnerability at a time of mounting internal pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Against this backdrop, Iran's aging supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, appears to be facing one of the most uncertain moments of his rule. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than three decades of careful planning to build regional proxy forces, sanction-evasion mechanisms, and nuclear infrastructure have been undermined or destroyed in a relatively short period of time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Trump back in the White House and Benjamin Netanyahu in power in Israel, there appears to be no clear diplomatic or strategic path out of the current crisis without a hefty price.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, Khamenei and his inner circle justified massive spending on regional allies and the nuclear program as necessary investments in Iran's long-term security and technological advancement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, that argument appears increasingly hollow. As pressure builds both inside and outside the country, security at home, once presented as the ultimate payoff of those policies, seems more distant than ever.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
