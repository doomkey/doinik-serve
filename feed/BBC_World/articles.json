Dozens of opposition supporters were killed and thousands were detained in the ensuing crackdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday evening, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQf-JaAYPW/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">videos posted on social media and verified by BBC Persian</a> showed a large crowd of protesters moving along a major road in Mashhad, in the country's north-east.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chants of \"Long live the shah\" and \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\" can be heard. And at one point, several men are seen climbing on an overpass and removing what appears to be surveillance cameras attached to it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQkM8lDPu-/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">video posted online</a> showed a large crowd of protesters walking along a major road in eastern Tehran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In footage <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQ06Pwgo-F/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sent to BBC Persian from the north of the capital</a>, another large crowd is heard chanting \"This is the final battle! Pahlavi will return\". Elsewhere in the north, protesters were filmed shouting \"Dishonourable\" and \"Don't be afraid, we are all together\" following a clash with security forces. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/42b0/live/e740c480-ed30-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Middle East Images / AFP via Getty Images A group of people in face masks and hoods gather around burning debris outside shuttered shops in Kermanshah on Thursday.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Middle East Images / AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Protests were also reported in several other provinces, including Kermanshah - pictured here on Thursday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other videos showed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQrstpiJhT/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">protesters chanting \"Death to the dictator\"</a> - a reference to Khamenei - in the central city of Isfahan; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/GhonchehAzad/status/2009319292576387194\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"Long live the shah\"</a> in the northern city of Babol, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQpWxAFESy/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"Don't be afraid, we are all together\"</a> in the north-western city of Tabriz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the western city of Dezful, footage sent to BBC Persian showed a large crowd of protesters and also <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQqxVGDYlB/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security personnel appearing to open fire from a central square</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC and other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran, so social media is relied upon to find out and verify what is happening on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The evening protests came not long after Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution and lives in Washington DC, had called on Iranians to \"take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X, Pahlavi said \"millions of Iranians demanded their freedom tonight\", describing the protesters as his \"courageous compatriots\". He thanked US President Donald Trump for holding the \"regime to account\", and called on European leaders to do the same.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi has also called for protests to continue from 20:00 local time (16:30 GMT) on Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have also been separate calls for protests by Kurdish opposition groups and some university student groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seventeen Iran-based rights activists, including imprisoned Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi, have meanwhile issued a joint statement saying that a peaceful transition from the Islamic Republic is an undeniable necessity for Iran's future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian state media downplayed the scale of Thursday's unrest. In some cases, they denied protests had taken place altogether, posting videos of empty streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, internet watchdog NetBlocks said its metrics showed that Iran was \"in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The incident follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment,\" it warned, referring to previous losses of connectivity in several cities.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQaP2liWDP/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">footage from Lomar, a small town in the western province of Ilam, showed a crowd chanting \"Cannons, tanks, fireworks, mullahs must go\"</a> - a reference to the clerical establishment. Another showed people throwing papers into the air outside a bank that appeared to have been broken into.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTPyBlNCfHv/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Other videos showed many shuttered shops</a> in a number of predominantly Kurdish cities and towns in Ilam, as well as Kermanshah and Lorestan provinces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It followed a call for a general strike by exiled Kurdish opposition groups in response to the deadly crackdown on protests in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 17 protesters have been killed by security forces in Ilam, Kermanshah and Lorestan during the unrest, and many of them have been members of the Kurdish or Lor ethnic minorities, according to Kurdish human rights group Hengaw.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, there were violent clashes between protesters and security forces in several cities and towns in western Iran, as well as other regions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">IHR said it had been the deadliest day of the unrest, with 13 protesters confirmed to have been killed across the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The evidence shows that the scope of crackdown is becoming more violent and more extensive every day,\" said the group's director, Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hengaw said two protesters were shot dead by security forces in Khoshk-e Bijar, in the northern province of Gilan, on Wednesday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's semi-official news agency Fars, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, reported that three police officers were also killed on Wednesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said two were shot dead by armed individuals among a group of \"rioters\" in the south-western town of Lordegan, and the third was stabbed to death \"during efforts to control unrest\" in Malard country, west of Tehran.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6799/live/8da3c320-ecde-11f0-bba2-5b0f4fc81c5e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"X Protesters walk down a major road in Mashhad, north-eastern Iran, on 8 January 2026\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">X</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In videos from Mashhad, protesters can be heard chanting \"Long live the shah\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, US President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to intervene militarily if Iranian authorities killed protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots - they have lots of riots - if they do it, we are going to hit them very hard,\" he said in an interview with the Hugh Hewitt Show.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said the Iranian economy was \"on the ropes\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While speaking at the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday, he added: \"[President Trump] does not want them to harm more of the protesters. This is a tense moment.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier called on security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" when handling peaceful protests. \"Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,\" a statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khamenei - who has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans critical of the clerical establishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In messages sent to the BBC, via a UK-based activist, a woman in Tehran said despair was driving the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're living in limbo,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm hanging in the air with neither wings to migrate nor hope to pursue my goals here. Life here has become unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

It comes after Trump said a military operation in Colombia \"sounds good\". Petro said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached the White House for comment. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98py70npj9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future</a>. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the US says were being used for drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water \"we are going to start now hitting land\", adding that \"the cartels are running Mexico\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration says it<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ljjd5rwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025</a>. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials said the woman,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Renee Nicole Good</a>, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlz7r0zrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">after a CIA source in Venezuelan government</a> helped the US track his location.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gustavo Petro said Colombia preferred dialogue with the US, but added the country's history showed \"how it has responded to large armies\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" adding: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro denied the claims, saying it has \"always been proven that I'm not involved in that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a \"total peace\" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described \"two simultaneous approaches.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, \"where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred\" and \"where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most.\" Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to \"de-escalate violence\", adding: \"we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill.

This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

something it says it now can only do for those who pay a monthly fee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the AI tool can still edit images on X if accessed through other areas of the platform, such as via its in-built \"edit image\" function, or on its separate app and website.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached X for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister's official spokesperson told reporters on Friday it showed X \"can move swiftly when it wants to do so\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said it was \"abundantly clear that X needs to act and needs to act now\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is time for X to grip this issue, if another media company had billboards in town centres showing unlawful images, it would act immediately to take them down or face public backlash,\" they added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Liberal Democrats have called for access to X to be temporarily restricted in the UK while the social media site is investigated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse,\" said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it \"does not undo the harm which has been done\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charity <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvg1mzlryxeo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously said</a> its analysts had discovered \"criminal imagery\" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which \"appeared to have been created\" using Grok.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable,\" Swirsky said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Subscribe to unlock'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies under other users' posts to ask it for a particular response.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the feature has also allowed people to request it to edit images - and ask it to digitally strip people of most of their clothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grok has fulfilled many user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp9jxvx0zjmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">humiliated</a>\" and \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98p1r4e6m8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">dehumanised</a>\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It adds users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a blue tick \"verified\" mark - exclusive to X's paid subscriber tier - were able to successfully request image edits to Grok.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Daisy Dixon, a lecturer in philosophy at Cardiff University and female X user who said she had seen an increase in people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt \"like a sticking plaster\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet another instance of gender-based violation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Charities campaigning to end violence towards women also criticised X over the move.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To restrict access to paying subscribers is not only inadequate – it represents the monetisation of abuse,\" said Emma Pickering of Refuge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said while limiting the feature to paid X users may reduce volume, abuse had \"simply been placed behind a paywall, allowing X to profit from harm\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women coalition, said \"we are not convinced that X will take action to identify and prevent this, given it has dragged its heels with tackling this abuse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof McGlynn said X's response echoed its approach to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwye62e1ndjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">pornographic Taylor Swift deepfakes on the platform last year</a> -

Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The move comes after the US <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cq6v25eldmdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro</a> in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115864395969123502\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">wrote on Truth Social</a> that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of \"seeking peace\" and as a result, he had cancelled a \"previously expected second wave of attacks\" on the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of \"national unity and peaceful coexistence\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-68252226\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">involved in a plot to kill the then-president</a> and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential \"enforced disappearance\" by the UN Human Rights Office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx20gyn8qvvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future</a>.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC reports from outside Venezuela prison \"El Helicoide\" as detainees released</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had \"given orders to close that prison,\" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US \"next week sometime\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said \"that would be a great honour\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-norberto-paredes.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Norberto Paredes.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It also made a number of arrests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The man, named only as Shahriar J in line with German privacy laws, has both German and Iranian nationality. He was arrested at his parents' home in Hamburg last summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is charged with 204 offences against more than 30 children and teenagers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in Hamburg say the crimes were committed between 2021 and 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shahriar J is suspected of having made particularly vulnerable children emotionally dependent on him via social media. He is then believed to have exploited that bond to create child pornography.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some of the cases, he is accused of persuading his victims to take their own life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors have charged him with one murder and five attempted murders, \"as an indirect perpetrator.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All his crimes are said to have been committed via the internet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reports in the German media say one of his victims, a 13-year-old boy from the US, took his own life in real time online.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 14-year-old Canadian girl is alleged to have attempted to take her own life too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the charge sheet, in order to comply with Shahriar J's demands for increasingly violent content, the children seriously injured themselves or performed sexual acts on themselves in live chats in front of viewers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The defendant is accused of having made recordings of this in order to threaten the children with publication if they did not inflict even more serious self-harm on themselves in front of the camera.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because some of the alleged offences were committed when Shahriar J was a teenager himself, the trial is taking place behind closed doors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the trial began, the 21-year-old's defence lawyer, Christiane Yüksel, rejected the allegations as baseless and fabricated.

I said [to the Indian side] you got to have Modi call the president. They were uncomfortable doing it, so Modi didn't call,\" Lutnick said in a podcast released on Friday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has not yet commented on Lutnick's assertions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India, however, said on Friday that the characterisation of the discussions between Delhi and Washington in the remarks made by Lutnick was \"not accurate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India and the US were committed to negotiating a bilateral trade agreement as far back as 13 February last year. Since then both sides have held multiple rounds of negotiations to arrive at a balanced and mutually beneficial trade agreement. On several occasions, we have been close to a deal,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Modi and Trump had spoken on the phone eight times last year, covering \"covering different aspects of our wide-ranging partnership\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on the All-In Podcast, a business and technology show hosted by four venture capitalists, Lutnick said that Trump's philosophy of making deals was like a \"staircase\" - meaning the \"first stair gets the best deal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that India was the second country to enter into negotiations with the US for a trade deal after the UK, and that Washington gave Delhi \"three Fridays\" to close the deal. His role, Lutnick said, was to negotiate the contracts and set up the whole deal but that Trump was the one who closed them - and that India's reluctance to set up the phone call meant the agreement ran into trouble.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that after that, US closed a slew of deals with other countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said that when India got back later saying they were ready to take the initial deal, \"the train had left the station\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the terms of the deal that Lutnick claims India missed are unclear. Agriculture, for instance, has been a key sticking point in the negotiations - Washington has been pushing for greater access to India's farm sector but Delhi has fiercely protected it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, United States Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told senators in Washington that the US had received the \"best ever offer\" from India. He also called India a \"tough nut to crack\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also made several comments about India and Modi in recent days, including warning of an increase in tariffs if Delhi does not stop buying Russian oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India ramped up its purchase of cheaper oil from Moscow after the Ukraine war. Delhi had defended its decision saying that it needed to think about the energy needs of its vast population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the tariffs kicked in, oil refiners in India have been cutting their purchases from Moscow, according to several reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lutnick's comments come two days after US Senator Lindsey Graham said that Trump had \"greenlit\" a punishing Russia sanctions bill that, if passed by Congress, would allow for even higher secondary tariffs and sanctions on countries doing business with Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jaiswal said on Friday that India was \"aware of the proposed bill\" and was \"closely following developments\", reiterating the country's stance on the energy needs of its population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the 50% tariffs, India's good exports to the US <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/indias-exports-defy-tariffs-strengthen-hand-us-trade-talks-2025-12-16/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">jumped</a> more than 22% in November from a year earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tariffs and the accompanying rhetoric have put a strain on the relationship between India and the US. Modi, who has shared a warm relationship with Trump, was among the first world leaders to visit the White House after the president was sworn in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But since then, the relationship has gone downhill. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Delhi has repeatedly denied claims by Trump that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May. In June, India said that Modi had told Trump that Delhi would <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89ew9wde3lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">never accept third-party mediation</a> with Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the two leaders have spoken on the phone a few times, including in September when Trump called to wish Modi <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjedz3y5eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">on his birthday</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a \"pathway\" for the special forces to enter unseen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed.

One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,\" says Fitzgerald. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CBS Charred, burnt out cars in what looks to have been a car park\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CBS</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, was hit by US strikes as part of the operation</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The plan</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power.

This time round officials say the vote will be free and fair but UN experts have warned that may not be the case, citing what they describe as a \"pervasive climate of fear\" in Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, rights groups say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amnesty International described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings, and other violent acts as \"a brutal campaign of repression\" ahead of the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says the measures are necessary to ensure a peaceful election and prevent anyone from inciting riots on polling day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it comes to the election itself, Bobi Wine has urged voters to stay at polling stations and safeguard their ballots to help prevent vote rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But election officials have said people should cast their ballots peacefully and then leave, assuring that the vote counting will be transparent and observed by party agents, the media and election monitors. Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the electoral commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite government denials, there are also fears, based on previous experience, of an internet shutdown during the election aimed at preventing people from verifying results. The NUP says it has a vote-monitoring app that can overcome this issue by using Bluetooth technology.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">When will we know the results?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ae44/live/ee3d83d0-ed54-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters A view from below of a warehouse worker arranging black metal ballot boxes.

His supporters saw him as a pan-Africanist, who supported causes such as the campaign against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To his critics, he was a dictator who oversaw numerous human rights abuses until he was driven from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barre initially fled to Kenya, but Moi's government came under intense pressure from parliament and rights groups for hosting him.

Michael Chakma was allegedly struck on the head with a metal bracelet, while Anjel Chakma suffered stab wounds. Michael has recovered but Anjel died 17 days later in hospital, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police in Uttarakhand state (whose capital is Dehradun) have arrested five people in connection with the incident, but they have denied that the attack was racially motivated - a claim that Chakma's family strongly disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which has triggered protests in several cities, has put the spotlight on allegations of racism faced by people from India's north-eastern states when they move to larger cities for education or work. They say they are often mocked over their appearance, questioned about nationality and harassed in public spaces and workplaces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the discrimination extends beyond abuse to everyday barriers that shape where and how they live. People from the region report difficulty renting accommodation, with landlords refusing tenants because of their appearance, food habits or stereotypes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such pressures have led many north-eastern migrants in large cities to cluster in specific neighbourhoods, offering safety, mutual support and cultural familiarity far from home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while many say they learn to endure everyday prejudices to build lives elsewhere in the country, violent crimes such as Anjel Chakma's killing are deeply unsettling.

No specific anti-racism legislation has been enacted, and many of the recommendations remain only partially implemented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has sought clarification from the federal government, but they are yet to respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The renewed demands over an anti-racism law have revived a broader debate over whether legislation can address prejudice, often seen as rooted in social behaviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts and activists such as Chakma and Golmei argue that it can. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They cite laws criminalising dowry and caste-based atrocities, arguing that while these haven't ended abuse, they have empowered victims and raised awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An anti-racism law could empower victims, improve reporting and place racial abuse clearly within the scope of criminal accountability,\" Golmei said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile in Tripura, Tarun Chakma mourns his elder son while facing uncertainty over his younger one: Michael, a final-year sociology student, is expected to return to Dehradun to complete his studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While family members have urged caution, Tarun Chakma says he is torn between fear for his son's safety and the belief that abandoning his education would amount to another loss. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the end of the day, higher education for a better future was the reason for which we had sent our sons so far away from home,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There are multiple videos taken by bystanders from various locations. And yet even the basic facts are being disputed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost immediately after the shooting, two starkly different accounts began to take shape. Any ambiguities in the videos shared online were seized upon - different angles and different screengrabs were used to push a particular narrative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And on the public stage, state and federal officials openly disagreed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the driver – 37-year-old Renee Good – was to blame. As she drove away from ICE officers, she \"weaponised her car\" in a \"domestic terror attack\", Noem said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump blamed a \"professional agitator\" and a \"radical left movement of violence and hate\" in a Truth Social post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">National Democrats - and state and local officials in Minnesota - have painted a completely different picture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jacob Frey, the Democratic Mayor of Minneapolis, said a federal agent \"recklessly\" used lethal force. He also issued an expletive-laced demand for immigration enforcement officials to leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting \"totally predictable\" and \"totally avoidable\", arguing it was a direct consequence of the surge in federal immigration officers into Minneapolis and surrounding areas in recent days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have been warning for weeks that the Trump administration's dangerous, sensationalised operations are a threat to our public safety,\" he said on Wednesday.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b515/live/4f894430-ecbf-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Image shows a protest against ICE in Minneapolis\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">There have been demonstrations against ICE operations following the shooting</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This clear division between the federal government and local officials was only further illustrated on Thursday morning, when the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension announced that the justice department and the FBI were no longer co-operating with its investigation into the shooting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal agencies, it said, would be solely responsible for handling the investigation into the use of lethal force by the ICE agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That Minnesota has become the epicentre of a growing conflict over immigration enforcement in recent months is both unsurprising - and ironic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is ironic because Good's death occurred just a few miles from where, in 2020, Minneapolis police killed George Floyd during an attempted arrest, setting off nationwide Black Lives Matters protests – including some, in Minneapolis, that turned violent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walz has put the state's National Guard on standby, and cautioned the hundreds of protesters who have taken to the streets not to resort to violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota's central role in this latest flare-up is unsurprising because it marks the culmination of conflict, controversy and scandal that had been building for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent surge in immigration enforcement comes after Trump derided the state's large Somali immigrant population -

The use of force during this operation is far from an isolated incident, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Minnesota incident was at least the ninth immigration-enforcement-related shooting since September – all involving individuals who were targeted while in their vehicles - according to the New York Times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The intensity with which the immigration actions have been undertaken – in an expanding list of cities across the US – has led to protests and calls from Democratic officials for greater oversight, accountability and restraint among law enforcement agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fatal Minneapolis shooting has already given these efforts new urgency among their advocates.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump administration officials, for their part, are pressing ahead – citing the mandate they say they received from voters in the 2024 presidential election as well as the evidence, in dramatically reduced undocumented entries into the US, that their efforts have proven effective.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also vigorously disputed the argument that the video of the Minneapolis shooting is evidence of a misuse of lethal force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The gaslighting is off the charts and I'm having none of it,\" Vice-President JD Vance wrote in a post on X. \"This guy was doing his job. She tried to stop him from doing his job.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While he said the incident was tragic, he added that \"it falls on this woman and all of the radicals who teach people that immigration is the one type of law that rioters are allowed to interfere with\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Walz, in his next public comments, was quick to counter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People in positions of power have already passed judgement, from the president to the vice-president to Kristi Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,\" he said. \"They have determined the character of a 37-year-old mom that they didn't even know.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears that even video evidence is open to interpretation at this point. Each person sees the same images and draws decidedly different conclusions – ones that frequently, perhaps not surprisingly, reinforce their previously established positions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chasm in US politics seems as immutable as it is daunting.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

It was amazing, amazing work by these people. No one else could do something like this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president wants and needs quick victories. Before he took office for the second time, he boasted that ending the Russia-Ukraine war would be a single day's work.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela, as presented in Trump's statements, is the quick, decisive victory that he has craved. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro is in a prison cell in Brooklyn, the US will \"run\" Venezuela - and he has announced that the Chavista regime, now with a new president, will turn over millions of barrels of oil and that he will control the way the profits are spent. All, so far anyway, without an American life lost and without the long occupation that had such catastrophic consequences after the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, at least, Trump and his advisers, publicly at least, are ignoring Venezuela's complexities. It is a country bigger than Germany, still run by the regime of factions that has embedded corruption and repression into Venezuelan politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Trump is enjoying a geopolitical sugar rush. Judging by their statements as they flanked him at Mar-a-Lago, so are US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, they have repeated that Trump was a president who does what he says he is going to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's made it clear to Colombia, Mexico, Cuba, Greenland – and Denmark – that they need to be nervous about where his appetite will take him next.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump likes nicknames. He still calls his predecessor Sleepy Joe Biden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now he's trying out a new name for the Monroe Doctrine, which has been a foundation of US policy in Latin America for two centuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump renamed it, naturally, after himself – the Donroe doctrine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, unveiled the original in December 1823. It declared that the western hemisphere was America's sphere of interest – and warned European powers not to meddle or establish new colonies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Donroe Doctrine puts Monroe's 200-year-old message on steroids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago as Maduro, blindfolded and shackled, was on this way to jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1054/live/33110130-ecba-11f0-a5c6-8d86b70e9199.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Three law enforcement officers escorting handcuffed Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores on tarmac in New York City.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores are now being detained in New York</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any rival or potential threat, especially China, has to stay out of Latin America. It's not clear where that leaves the massive investments that China has already made in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donroe also extends the huge area the US calls its \"backyard\" north to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 2026 equivalent of Monroe's copperplate handwriting is a photo of a frowning, moody looking Trump posted by the US State Department on social media. The words with it say, \"this is OUR hemisphere – and President Trump will not allow our security to be threatened\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That means using US military and economic power to coerce countries and leaders that get out of line – and to take their resources if necessary. As Trump warned another possible target, the president of Colombia – they need to watch their ass.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is in America's sights, not just because of its strategic importance in the Arctic – but because it has rich mineral resources that are becoming accessible as climate change melts the ice sheets. Rare earths from Greenland and heavy crude oil from Venezuela are both seen as strategic US assets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike other interventionist US presidents, Trump does not cloak his actions with the legitimacy, however spurious, of international law or the pursuit of democracy. The only legitimacy he needs comes from his belief in the force of his own will, backed by raw US power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From Monroe to Donroe, foreign policy doctrines matter to US presidents. They shape their actions and their legacies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, the US will celebrate its 250th birthday. In 1796, its first president, George Washington, announced he wouldn't seek a third term with a farewell address that still resonates today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington issued a series of warnings about the US and the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Temporary alliances in time of war might be necessary, but the US should otherwise avoid permanent alliances with foreign nations. That started the tradition of isolationism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home, he warned citizens to beware of extreme partisanship. Division, he said, was a danger to the young American republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Senate does an annual public re-reading of Washington's farewell address, a ritual that does not cut through the hyper-partisan and polarised politics of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington's warning about the dangers of entangling alliances was followed for 150 years. After World War One, the US left Europe and returned to isolationism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But World War Two made the US into a global power. And that is where another doctrine comes in, much more significant for the way Europeans have lived – until Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 1947, the Cold War with the Soviet Union had turned frigid. The UK, left bankrupt by the war, told the US it could no longer fund the Greek government's fight with communists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then-President Harry Truman's response was to commit US to support, in his words, \"free peoples resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\". He meant threats from the Soviet Union or homegrown communists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was the Truman Doctrine. It led to the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe, followed in 1949 by the creation of Nato. Atlanticists in the US, like Harry Truman and George Kennan - the diplomat who came up with the idea of containing the Soviet Union - believed those commitments were in America's interests.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a direct line from the Truman Doctrine to Joe Biden's decision to fund Ukraine's war effort. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, the Truman Doctrine created the relationship with Europe that Trump has been dismantling. It was a sharp break with the past. Truman ignored Washington's warning about permanent entangling alliances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now Trump is breaking with Truman's legacy. If he follows through with his threat to somehow take possession of Greenland, which is Danish sovereign territory, he could destroy what's left of the transatlantic alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maga ideologue and powerful Trump adviser Stephen Miller summed it up earlier this week on CNN. The US, he said, was operating in the real world that \"is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power… these are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US president would deny the need for strength and power. But from Franklin D Roosevelt, through Truman and all their successors until Trump, the men in the Oval Office believed the best way to be powerful was to lead an alliance, which meant give and take.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They supported the new United Nations and the drive to make rules to regulate the behaviour of states. The US, of course, has ignored and violated international law many times – doing much to hollow out the idea of a rules-based international order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump's predecessors did not try to sweep away the notion that the international system needed regulation, however flawed and incomplete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because of the catastrophic consequences in the first half of the 20th Century of the rule of the strongest – two world wars and millions dead.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the combination of Trump's \"America First\" ideology and his businessman's acquisitive, transactional instincts have led him to believe that America's allies need to pay for the privilege of his favour. Friendship seems too strong a word. America's interests, in the narrow definition laid out by the president, require it to stay top dog by acting alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump changes his mind often. But one constant appears to be his belief that the US can use its power with impunity. He says that it is the way to make America great again. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The risk is that, if Trump sticks to his course, he will push the world back to the way it was in the age of empires a century or more ago - a world where big powers, with spheres of influence, sought to impose their will, and where mighty authoritarian nationalists led their peoples to disaster.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
