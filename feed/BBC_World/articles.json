The Minneapolis woman was found by paramedics with at least three gunshot wounds and possibly a fourth to the head, according to official reports viewed by CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Governor Walz responded on Friday to news of the inquiry against him by posting on X: \"Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement to the BBC, Mayor Frey said \"I will not be intimidated\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, our local law enforcement, and our residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our streets,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has reached out to the justice department about the apparent investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor has urged Minnesotans to protest peacefully, but members of the Trump administration have accused him of inflammatory rhetoric, like describing ICE as a \"modern-day Gestapo\". Frey has demanded that immigration agents get out of Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The inquiry is focused on a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 372, which makes it a crime for two or more people to conspire to prevent federal officers from carrying out their official duties through \"force, intimidation or threats\", a US official told CBS.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protests continued in Minneapolis on Friday as US District Judge Katherine Menendez blocked federal authorities from using pepper spray and other non-lethal force on those demonstrating. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 83-page order halts the thousands of federal officers currently deployed to the city as part of immigration operations from arresting peaceful protesters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also blocks them from stopping or detaining those who are driving or passengers in vehicles \"where there is no reasonable articulable suspicion that they are forcibly obstructing or interfering\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The judge notes that a person following federal law enforcement in their vehicle \"does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before she was killed, footage showed Good in her SUV, appearing to honk the vehicle to alert neighbours in the area of the presence of immigration authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has said that Good was impeding federal law enforcement and tried to run the agent over before he opened fire. Local officials say Good was a legal observer who posed no danger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video of the incident show ICE agents approaching a car, which is blocking traffic and parked in the middle of the street.

We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.

Experts say this latest review, in a Lancet journal, is rigorous and should end the debate over its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US health officials maintain that \"many experts\" have expressed concern over its use during pregnancy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US President shocked many doctors worldwide when he and his administration claimed paracetamol or a branded version called Tylenol - which is seen as the go-to painkiller for pregnant women - could be linked to autism in children, if taken during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those claims led to confusion among women and concern among health experts, and prompted this new research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanogw/article/PIIS3050-5038(25)00211-0/fulltext\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology &amp; Women's Health</a>, it looked at 43 of the most robust studies into paracetamol use during pregnancy, involving hundreds of thousands of women, particularly those comparing pregnancies where the mother had taken the drug to pregnancies where she hadn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say using these high-quality studies of siblings means they can dismiss other factors such as different genes and family environments, which makes their review \"gold-standard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research also looked at studies with a low risk of bias and those that followed children for more than five years to check for any link.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we did this analysis, we found no links, there was no association, there's no evidence that paracetamol increases the risk of autism,\" lead study author and consultant obstetrician Professor Asma Khalil, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The message is clear – paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This reinforces guidance from major medical organisations in the UK, US and Europe on the safety of the common painkiller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any previously-reported links between the drug and an increased risk of autism are likely to be explained by other factors, rather than a direct effect of the paracetamol itself, the review says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever,\" said Prof Khalil, professor of maternal fetal medicine at City St George's, University of London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Health advice warns that women can run the risk of harming their baby if they don't take paracetamol to bring down a high temperature or relieve pain when pregnant.

As Trump spoke, a bipartisan congressional delegation was visiting Greenland to show support for the territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 11-member group included Republicans who voiced concerns about the president's calls for the US to somehow acquire Greenland for national security reasons. They met MPs as well as Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Group leader Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat, said their trip was to listen to the locals and take their views back to Washington \"to lower the temperature\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said Greenland is vital for US security - and Washington would get it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\" - an apparent reference to buying the island or taking it by force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" Trump said at Friday's White House meeting on rural healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is sparsely populated but resource-rich and its location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks and for monitoring vessels in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base - a missile-monitoring station on Greenland's north-western tip that has been operated by the US since World War Two. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Trump has said the US needs to \"own\" it to defend it properly against possible Russian or Chinese attacks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark has warned that military action would spell the end of Nato -

They are now detained in New York, where they have pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking and other charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US official described the meeting between Rodríguez and Ratcliffe as \"historic\", adding that Ratcliffe was the first cabinet-level official to travel to Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The meeting also happened on the same day that Trump met opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in Washington, who presented the US president with her Nobel Peace Prize winning medal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her state of the union address, Rodríguez told Venezuelans it was \"very difficult\" to deliver Maduro's annual report, saying that the two were working on the speech together until six hours before his seizure on 3 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noting the US is a nuclear power, the interim president said she was not afraid to engage in diplomacy, saying \"we have to go together as Venezuelans to defend sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and also defend our dignity and our honour\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She continued that if she needed to travel to Washington DC to meet with Trump, she would do so \"walking on her feet, not dragged there\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that \"all of Venezuela is threatened\", and called for national unity to \"wage the diplomatic battle\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her address, Rodríguez announced the proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, saying she had asked the legislative body to approve it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, Venezuela's hydrocarbon law has stated foreign partners must work with the country's state-owned oil and gas company, PDVSA - which must hold a majority stake. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The reforms, Rodríguez said, would allow investment to flow to new fields. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she had instructed her government to create two sovereign funds - one for social protection so that \"foreign currency goes directly to hospitals, schools, food, housing\" and the second for infrastructure and social development to invest in water, electricity and roads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has been facing an economic crisis, with a sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. Before the US operation to seize Maduro, Venezuelans <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e0jnww2e9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the BBC they were concerned about what they were going to eat.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape.

You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also said that \"one of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since crude oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron is the last remaining major American oil company still operating in the country.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC Verify examines claims Venezuela \"stole\" US oil</figcaption></p></article></div></body></html>"

Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it seems to be working.

As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A frosty history </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861yyqxg4do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a decisive victory</a> . </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-koh-ewe\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Koh Ewe</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

and what that means for sea-level rise.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w15nggj58o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a warming climate</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study is published in the academic journal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady2532\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Science</a>.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It airs on Fox in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's 21-month-old son, has ignited a fierce debate about patient safety within Nigeria's healthcare system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the outcry, the health minister has admitted \"systemic challenges\" and announced the creation of a national task force on \"clinical governance and patient safety\" to improve the quality of care and patient safety.</p><p

illness. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They allege the child was denied oxygen and excessively sedated, leading to cardiac arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hospital extended its \"deepest sympathies\" but in a statement denied any wrongdoing, stating its treatment met international standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lagos State Government has ordered an investigation into the death, as public outrage spread over the state of healthcare in Africa's most populous country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Just days later, anger surged once more after the death of Aisha Umar, a mother of five who ran a business from home, selling incense and fish in the northern city of Kano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her family alleges a pair of

class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>products manager Josephine Obi, 29, recounted how her father died in 2021 at the state-run Lagos University Teaching Hospital after what she says was a surgical error during a routine procedure for a goitre - a lump or swelling at the front of the neck caused by a swollen thyroid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They cut a major artery... it was a very minor surgery,\" Obi told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said a supervising doctor apologised, admitting a mistake had been made. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family chose not to sue to avoid a potentially costly and protracted legal battle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You will just waste money and the case will linger... we just let it go,\" Obi said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC sent an email to the hospital seeking comment, but has not yet received a response. The BBC also phoned the numbers listed on the hospital's website, but they failed to go through.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Kano, prison facility officer Abdullahi Umar is still mourning his wife, Ummu Kulthum Tukur, who died three years ago at the age of 27 after giving birth to twins at the state-run Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He believes a timely Caesarean section would have saved her life. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She was in labour for over 24 hours... she lost a lot of blood and died,\" he said, adding that the hospital still refuses to provide a death certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Efforts to get the hospital to respond were unsuccessful as the spokesperson Hauwa Inuwa told the BBC she was on leave, instead sending the number of another member of staff, which did not work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joe Abah, a former boss of Nigeria's Bureau of Public Service Reforms, claimed on social media platform X how a private hospital in the capital, Abuja, urged him to undergo immediate surgery for an ailment. Unconvinced, he sought further opinions, including consultations abroad, which concluded no surgery was necessary, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Complaints about treatment in Nigeria's private hospitals are rare, although that is where Adichie's son was treated.

The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Through strikes on port and energy infrastructure, Russia is trying to cripple the region's economy and dent the population's morale.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"We can see and hear when the drones come,\" says Odesa resident Mariia</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow, however, does not just hit facilities. Its drones, most of them as big as a motorcycle, regularly crash into high-rise buildings like Masha's, exploding on impact and blowing glass and debris inward. The consequences are often deadly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A few months ago Eva said she was afraid the drone would come too fast and we wouldn't have time to hide,\" Mariia says. \"But I explained that if it came towards us, it would get louder and louder and then we'd know we have to run.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mariia, Sergii and Eva are originally from Kherson, a region 200km (125m) to the east of Odesa which is now in large part occupied by Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They left as soon as the invasion started in 2022 and mother and daughter briefly moved to Germany as refugees. But Sergii and Mariia could not bear the distance, so the family reunited in Ukraine and moved to Odesa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, as attacks on the region intensify, Sergii wonders whether the family should prepare to leave again. \"War is only about economics, and Odesa for the Russians is about infrastructure, so they will do their best to conquer it,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sergii, Mariia and Eva's Odesa apartment suffers from frequent power cuts</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tucked in south-western Ukraine, Odesa was an economic powerhouse before the war. But now that Russia occupies the majority of Ukraine's coastline, the region has become even more vital. Its three ports are Ukraine's largest and include the country's only deep-water port. With land crossings disrupted, 90% of Ukraine exports last year were shipped by sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in wartime the region's importance is also its weakness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Vladimir Putin threatened to cut off Ukraine's access to the sea in retaliation for Ukrainian strikes on the \"shadow fleet\" tankers Russia uses to circumvent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That threat has translated into concrete impact. For two years, Russia's attempts to thwart Odesa's economy have been near-relentless - but the last few weeks have been particularly difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aerial attacks on the ports have destroyed cargo and containers and damaged infrastructure; crew members on foreign merchant ships operating in the Gulf of Odesa have been injured or killed by drones; and 800 air-raid alerts in a year repeatedly halted port operations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cfdb/live/39df2600-f2ea-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A view of Odesa during a blackout\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Power outages have plunged much of Odesa into darkness since December</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The result last year was a 45% decrease in exports of agricultural products, vital to Odesa's economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The day after a drone strike this week set a Panamanian-flagged ship alight and severely injured one of its crew members, regional government head Oleh Kiper said that shipowners entering Odesa ports \"clearly understand that they are entering a war zone\" and that the ships were insured. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if such attacks continue, in the long run foreign companies may be put off trading with the port.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"After a strike like last night's, the people who live here will go to shelters for some time, then they will relax again,\" says Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the strikes surge, air sirens go off frequently, but not everyone heeds them. Standing in front of a destroyed gym the morning after an overnight drone strike that injured seven people, Maryna Averina of the State Emergency Service concedes people have become \"very careless about their own safety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent air raid alert lasted for most of the day. \"Sitting in a shelter for 16 hours is simply unrealistic,\" Averina says, as gym staff emerge from the destroyed building with whatever objects they have managed to salvage from the rubble and mangled metal inside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many Ukrainians are now sadly accustomed to the drone and missile strikes, they are increasingly frayed by the relentless attacks that cut off electricity and heating in the middle of a particularly biting winter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In December, almost a million people in Odesa were left with no power. \"We were among the first regions to experience what it means to go through the winter period without electricity and without heating,\" says Oleh Kiper.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">\"I live in hope that all this will end soon,\" says Yana. \"We've all been living like this for four years now, but unfortunately, for now it's how it is.\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A month later, as temperatures hover around -1C, the supply remains severely disrupted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ada, 36, is strolling on the beach, unfazed by the wail of air alert sirens mingling with the squawking of seagulls. The drone attacks have ramped up but, she says, \"the shelling isn't as scary as this cold is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearby, a young mum named Yana agrees. Recently, she says, the situation across the board \"has been really, really difficult\". At one point, a drone crashed into her flat, and another one hit the block soon afterwards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then came the power cuts. She and her family bought an expensive generator, but running it for seven hours costs around $10 - a significant expense in a country where the average monthly salary is around $500 (£375).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've all been living like this for four years now, unfortunately. We're as helpless as flies, and everything is just being decided between the authorities,\" she says, while struggling to keep her shrieking toddler out of the icy water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe we're being punished for something – the whole nation, not just a few, but everyone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Further down the beach, Kostya is fishing on a jetty stretching out into the sea. He says he is not worried about the Russians advancing to the city. \"I don't think they'll make it here. [The Ukrainians] will break their legs first.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he adds, things are painful, and scary. And like many Ukrainians he still seems to struggle to accept that war came to his country four years ago, waged by a neighbour he once knew so well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his youth, Kostya served in the army and swore an oath to the Soviet Union. \"I never imagined that I would see something like this in my old age,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Russian propagandists have long insisted that Ukraine's independence since 1991 is a historical mistake, Odesa's past role as the jewel in the crown of the Russian empire means it still holds particularly strong symbolic importance for Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vladimir Putin has repeatedly referred to Odesa as a \"Russian city\" and frequently invoked the notion of \"liberating Novorossiya\", a historical region of the Russian empire that encompassed parts of modern southern and eastern Ukraine, including Odesa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They wanted and they still want to seize Odesa, just like many other regions, but today everything possible and impossible is being done by our military to prevent this from happening,\" insists the regional government leader.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1cce/live/a9589090-f2ed-11f0-9a08-61d9f795eeed.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A large statue in the middle of a square is dismantled\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A statue of Russian empress Catherine the Great, the founder of Odesa, was among the first to be dismantled </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oleh Kiper has made it a personal mission to sever any perceived remaining ties that Odesa has with Russia.

Pushkin Street became Italian Street, and Catherine Street is now European Street. Kiper also champions the usage of Ukrainian in a city where Russian is still very widely spoken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about the resistance he meets from Odesites who are proud of their heritage as a multicultural port to the world, he is defiant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The enemy is doing far more than we are to ensure that a Russian-speaking city becomes Ukrainian,\" says Kiper. \"It is forcing people to understand who the Russians are and whether we need them at all.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The following day, as temperatures dropped to -6C, the city marked one month of partial blackouts, and air raid alerts were in force for four hours. The port of Chernomorsk, east of Odesa, was again hit by a ballistic missile, injuring a crew member on a civilian ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is the case with the rest of Ukraine, if Russia cannot have Odesa, it seems determined to continue crippling it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-liubov-sholudko\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

questionable policy from the central bank and testing the legal limits to get it - to Martin Redrado, sitting in Argentina, Donald Trump's stand-off with the Federal Reserve feels surprisingly familiar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado was fired as head of Argentina's central bank in 2010, after he resisted orders by then-President Cristina Kirchner to hand over reserves to help pay off national debts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He fought the decision successfully in court, but eventually resigned in the face of what he told the BBC was \"intolerable\" pressure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, the clash is remembered as one of the early warnings of the economic turmoil that later engulfed Argentina, exposing it to high inflation and a currency plunge from which the country is still recovering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's fight with the Fed has sparked debate about whether the US might be heading in a similar direction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since his return to office last year, Trump has accused the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, of mishandling the economy and driving up debt costs for the government by keeping interest rates too high.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his interventions at the bank have not been limited to social media complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Trump moved to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx275n8gx0ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sack a top policymaker, Lisa Cook</a>, a decision now being challenged at the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Sunday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c801k7rkkd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Powell said the Fed was facing a criminal probe from the Department of Justice</a>, relating to cost overruns at a property renovation - concerns that Powell has dismissed as \"pretext\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Market reaction to the drama has remained muted, which analysts said was a sign that investors expect the bank to be able to continue operating freely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that faith will be tested in the coming weeks, when the Supreme Court is due to hear arguments about Cook's firing and the president is expected to announce his pick to replace Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he has been surprised to see echoes of his own battle happening in the US, long held up as a global model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This seems more like an emerging market story,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not alone in making the comparison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is what you do in banana republics, not what should happen in the United States of America,\" economist Jason Furman, who led former President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, told the BBC, using a derogatory term often used to describe countries with unstable politics and economies subject to the whims of a ruling class. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC, former Fed chair Janet Yellen, who served as Treasury Secretary under Joe Biden, raised a similar spectre as she warned against the way Trump wants the Fed to conduct policy. \"It is the road to a banana republic,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Inflationary risks</h2></p><div

across an economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has denied involvement in the criminal probe, which he said had nothing to do with interest rates, while maintaining he has a right to express his views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's fine what I'm doing,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But economists say Trump keeps up his attacks at the risk of the economy, arguing that hard-won evidence shows central banks deliver the best results when they operate without political pressure. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\"

in the 1970s, including in the US, leading to a wave of global reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extensive academic research has since linked central bank independence to lower inflation over time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say elected officials have too many incentives to try to use bank power to secure an immediate economic boost or satisfy particular constituencies, even if it might hurt the economy over the long run. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But though Trump's pressure on the Fed is unprecedented for the US, the president is hardly the only leader to disregard advice to leave central bankers alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, former Prime Minister Liz Truss attacked the Bank of England, criticising its independence and accusing it of having too much power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study of central banks in 118 countries between 2010 and 2018 found roughly 10% of central banks each year faced pressure from political leaders, like Trump, wanting lower interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive and can deliver a short-term economic boost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressure on central bankers was most likely to emerge in countries with nationalist or populist leaders and was typically followed by higher inflation, says economist Carola Binder, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who conducted the review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cycled through three central bank leaders in three years between 2019 and 2021, as he looked for someone who would execute on his unorthodox view that high interest rates fed inflation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inflation soared past 50%, as the bank bowed to his demands, before he agreed to appoint leaders with more moderate views.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even in countries where central banks resisted the interference, Binder's research found that inflation tended to rise, albeit to a lesser degree, suggesting pressure alone could cause damage.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

economy was unlikely to face as severe a fallout as smaller nations like Argentina and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some say there are already signs the fight is having consequences, pointing to an 8% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the long term, it can be hard to identify the driver of economic damage - whether it is the loss of central bank independence or other, often related issues, like the erosion of democracy or rule of law, says Carolina Garriga, professor of political science at the University of Essex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says immediate market moves, like a dip in the dollar that followed the announcement of the Fed criminal probe, show investors consider central bank independence an important piece of the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to disentangle but it is not hard to disentangle when it's market reaction to an announcement.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the criminal probe became public, key Wall Street leaders and members of Congress, including some Republicans, have spoken up forcefully in defence of the Fed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Supreme Court, justices have also indicated that they see the bank as different from other arms of government, where they have let Trump's firings proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say they think the Fed will be able to maintain confidence in its policies, noting that it sets interest rates via a committee with 12 members, of whom the president appoints only seven and who each have long, staggered terms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is slight concern,\" says Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics. \"But there's not a switch here that says faith in US institutions has been lost and therefore we're in a downward spiral.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But much of the
