Behind him is a flag and blue curtains.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump's action in Venezuela may point to months of global turbulence</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the seizure of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, Donald Trump has demonstrated more powerfully than ever his belief in the power of his will, backed by raw US military force. On his orders the US has Maduro behind bars and now will \"run\" Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president made the announcement in a remarkable news conference with enormous implications for US foreign policy worldwide at his Florida club and residence, Mar-a-Lago.  Trump said the US would be in charge in Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, he said, had spoken to the Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez, who had told him \"we'll do whatever you need... She, I think, was quite gracious, but she really doesn't have a choice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was light on detail. He said that \"we're not afraid of boots on the ground if we have to have [them]\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But does he believe that he can govern Venezuela by remote control? Will this demonstration that he will back words with military action, praised lavishly at Mar-a-Lago by both Marco Rubio and the US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, be enough to reshape Venezuela and browbeat Latin American leaders into compliance?  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sounded as if he believes something like that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The evidence is that it will not be easy or smooth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The respected think tank, the International Crisis Group, warned in October that the fall of Maduro could lead to violence and instability in Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same month The New York Times reported that defence and diplomatic officials in the first Trump administration had war-gamed what might happen if Maduro fell. Their conclusion was the prospect of violent chaos as armed factions competed for power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The removal and incarceration of Nicolás Maduro is a remarkable assertion of American military power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US assembled a massive armada and achieved its goal without losing a single American life.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro had ignored the will of the Venezuelan people by sweeping aside his own electoral defeat and, without question, his departure will be welcomed by many of its citizens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the implications of the US action will reverberate forward, way beyond Venezuela's borders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mood at the Mar-a-Lago news conference was triumphalist, as they celebrated what was undoubtedly a textbook operation carried out by highly professional US forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military operation is only the first stage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">America's record of achieving regime change by force in the last 30 years is disastrous. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political follow-up is what makes or breaks the process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iraq descended into a bloody catastrophe after the US invasion in 2003. In Afghanistan two decades and billions of dollars' worth of attempted nation-building were swept away in days after the US pulled out in 2021.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Neither country was in America's backyard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the ghosts of interventions past in Latin America - and the threat of others yet to come - are scarcely more promising.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump tried out a new nickname, the Donroe Doctrine, for the declaration made by President James Monroe in 1823 warning other powers not to meddle in America's sphere of influence in the Western hemisphere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we've superseded it by a lot,\" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago. \"Under our new national security strategy, American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the President of Colombia, Gustavo Petro, had to \"watch his ass\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later he told Fox News that \"something's going to have to be done with Mexico\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba is undoubtedly also on the US agenda, which is being driven by Rubio, whose parents are Cuban-Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has a long record of armed intervention in Latin America. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was in Haiti in 1994 when President Bill Clinton sent in 25,000 troops and two aircraft carriers to enforce regime change. Then, the Haitian regime crumbled without a shot being fired. Far from ushering in a better future, the 30 years since then have been a period of almost unbroken misery for the Haitian people. Haiti is now a failed state dominated by armed gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump talked of making Venezuela great again, but not about democracy. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it'd be very tough for her to be the leader, she doesn't have the support... She doesn't have the respect.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not mention Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of the 2024 elections. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the US, for the time being anyway, is backing Maduro's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there must have been some kind of internal collusion that gave the US military the inside knowledge it needed to remove Maduro, the regime created by his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, appears to be intact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unlikely that the Venezuelan armed forces, despite any humiliation its generals might feel about their inability to oppose the US attack, will acquiesce with US plans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military and the regime's civilian supporters have enriched themselves through networks of corruption that they will not want to lose. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Civilian militias have been armed by the regime, and Venezuela has other armed groups. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include criminal networks, as well as Colombian guerrillas who backed the Maduro regime in return for sanctuary.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US intervention in Venezuela brings into stark focus some of the well springs of Trump's worldview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has already attempted to extract profit from Ukraine's natural resources in return for military assistance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump does not hide his desire to control Venezuela's huge mineral reserves, and his belief that US oil companies were robbed when the oil industry was nationalised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground, and that wealth is going to the people of Venezuela, and people from outside of Venezuela that used to be in Venezuela, and it goes also to the United States of America in the form of reimbursement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That will deepen the fears in Greenland and Denmark that he will look north as well as south. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has not dropped its desire to absorb Greenland, for its strategic position in the Arctic as well as the natural resources that are becoming more accessible as its ice melts due to global warming.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maduro operation also amounts to another serious blow to the idea that the best way to run the world is to follow an agreed set of rules, as laid out in international law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was tattered before Donald Trump took office, but he has already demonstrated repeatedly both in the US and internationally that he believes he can ignore laws he doesn't like.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European allies, who are desperate not to anger him, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer, are wrestling with ways to say that they support the idea of international law without condemning the fact that the Maduro operation is a blatant violation of the Charter of the United Nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US justification that its military was simply aiding the execution of an arrest warrant for a drug lord masquerading as Venezuela's president is thin, especially given Trump's declarations that the US will now control the country and its oil industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few hours before Maduro and his wife were seized, he met Chinese diplomats at his palace in Caracas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China condemned the US action. It said \"hegemonic acts of the US seriously violate international law and Venezuela's sovereignty and threaten peace and security in Latin America and the Caribbean region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US should \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even so, China might see a precedent set by the US action. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It regards Taiwan as a breakaway province and has declared that returning it to control of Beijing is a national priority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Washington, that is certainly the fear of the Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Mark Warner. He issued a statement saying China's leaders, and others, will be watching closely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the United States asserts the right to use military force to invade and capture foreign leaders it accuses of criminal conduct, what prevents China from claiming the same authority over Taiwan's leadership? What stops [Russian President] Vladimir Putin from asserting similar justification to abduct Ukraine's president? Once this line is crossed, the rules that restrain global chaos begin to collapse, and authoritarian regimes will be the first to exploit it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump seems to believe that he makes the rules, and what applies to the US under his command does not mean others can expect the same privileges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is not how the world of power works. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His actions at the start of 2026 point to another 12 months of global turbulence.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I don't,\" he added, seemingly implying that he was not as certain of Rodríguez's willingness to work with the US as Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What he was adamant about was the US's willingness to pressure Rodríguez's interim government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with ABC, Rubio also appeared to suggest that fresh elections should be held in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Government will come about through a period of transition and real elections, which they have not had,\" he told This Week. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also appealed for \"realism\", suggesting that fresh elections would take time: \"Everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Talk of fresh elections will no doubt disappoint not only María Corina Machado and Edmundo González but also many of the Venezuelans who voted for them and who have been adamant that they want to see those votes honoured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The opposition has long insisted that free and fair elections are not possible while the key institutions involved in organising them are stacked with Maduro loyalists.  A reform of those bodies will take time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the short term, therefore, Venezuela looks likely to be governed by Delcy Rodríguez and Maduro's inner circle - as long as they meet the Trump administration's expectations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How long that may last will depend on whether Rodríguez can find a golden middle between accommodating Trump's requests and the Maduro base interests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She may soon find herself between a rock and a hard place. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was the result of months of meticulous planning and rehearsals, which even included elite US troops creating an exact full-size replica of Maduro's Caracas safe house to practise their entry routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan - which amounted to an extraordinary US military intervention in Latin America not seen since the Cold War - was closely guarded. Congress was not informed or consulted ahead of time. With the precise details set, top military officials simply had to wait for the optimal conditions to launch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted to maximise the element of surprise, officials said on Saturday. There was a false start four days earlier when US President Donald Trump gave approval, but they opted to wait for better weather and less cloud cover.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Over the weeks through Christmas and New Year, the men and women of the United States military sat ready, patiently waiting for the right triggers to be met and the president to order us into action,\" General Dan Caine, the nation's highest-ranking military officer, told a news conference on Saturday morning.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Good luck and godspeed'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The order from the president to begin the mission finally came at 22:46 EST on Friday (03:46 GMT on Saturday). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were going to do this four days ago, three days ago, two days ago, and then all of a sudden it opened up. And we said: go,\" Trump himself told Fox &amp; Friends on Saturday, hours after the overnight raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said to us, and we appreciate it... good luck and godspeed,\" Gen Caine said. Trump's order came shortly before midnight in Caracas, giving the military most of the night to operate in darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What followed was a two-hour-and-twenty-minute mission by air, land and sea that stunned many in Washington and around the world. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In terms of scale and precision, it was virtually unprecedented. And it drew immediate condemnation from several regional powers, with Brazil's President Lula da Silva saying the violent capture of Venezuela's leader set \"yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump did not follow the mission from the White House situation room. Instead, he was surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he watched a live stream of the operation flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an incredible thing to see,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"If you would have seen what happened, I mean, I watched it literally like I was watching a television show. And if you would've seen the speed, the violence... it's just, it was an amazing thing, an amazing job that these people did.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\"

decades as Trump has accused Maduro of drug-trafficking and narco-terrorism, and blown up dozens of small boats accused of ferrying drugs through the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But

They included members of the elite Delta Force, the US military's top special mission unit, sources told the BBC's US news partner CBS. They were heavily armed - and carried a blowtorch in case they had to cut through the metal doors of Maduro's safe house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The troops arrived at Maduro's location shortly after the strikes began at 02:01 local time, according to Gen Caine. Trump described the safe house as a military \"fortress\" in the heart of Caracas, saying: \"They were in a ready position waiting for us. They knew we were coming.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The troops took fire when they arrived, and one of the US helicopters was hit but was still able to fly. \"The apprehension force descended into Maduro's compound and moved with speed, precision and discipline,\" Gen Caine said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broken into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,\" Trump remarked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was only as the operation - which also saw Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, seized - was unfolding that Rubio began notifying lawmakers about the action, a decision which has since prompted anger from some in the US Congress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Let me be clear: Nicolas Maduro is an illegitimate dictator. But launching military action without congressional authorisation and without a credible plan for what comes next is reckless,\" said top Democrat Chuck Schumer, the party's leader in the Senate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Briefing Congress ahead of time would have endangered the mission, Rubio told reporters during the news conference on Saturday. \"Congress has a tendency to leak,\" Trump added. \"This would not be good.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/552c/live/1e4453e0-e8e3-11f0-936c-19c35f0ff3e5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Fire at Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, is seen from a distance after a series of explosions in Caracas \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The US struck several locations around Caracas, including Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Maduro's compound, as elite US troops flooded in, Trump said the Venezuelan president - who has reportedly increased his reliance on Cuban bodyguards in recent months - attempted to flee to a safe room. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He was trying to get to a safe place, which wasn't safe, because we would have had the door blown up in about 47 seconds,\" Trump said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He made it to the door.

The first attack - on 2 September - has drawn particular scrutiny as there was not one but two strikes, with survivors of the first hit killed in the second.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign more generally fell into the category of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9kgqwnk8wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, the White House said it had acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in October, Trump said he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also threatened strikes on land against what he described as \"narco-terrorists\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the first of such strikes had been carried out on 24 December, though he gave little detail, just stating that it had targeted a \"dock area\" where boats alleged to carry drugs where being loaded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prior to Maduro's capture, Trump repeatedly said that Maduro \"is no friend of the US\" and that it would be \"smart for him to go\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also increased the financial pressure on Maduro by declaring a \"total naval blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Oil is the main source of foreign revenue for the Maduro government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also deployed a huge military force in the Caribbean, whose stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as targeting vessels they accuse of smuggling drugs, the force has also played a key role in the US naval blockade. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is Venezuela flooding the US with drugs?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report from 2020, almost three quarters of the cocaine reaching the US is estimated to be trafficked via the Pacific with just a small percentage coming via fast boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most of the early strikes the US has carried out were in the Caribbean, more recent ones have focused on the Pacific.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Trump told US military leaders that the boats targeted \"are stacked up with bags of white powder that's mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fentanyl is a synthetic drug which is 50 times more potent than heroin and has become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 December, Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction\", arguing that it was \"closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, fentanyl is produced mainly in Mexico and reaches the US almost exclusively via land through its southern border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela is not mentioned as a

But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The kidults</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience. Fans could buy stuffed toy versions of items like fish, chips and mushy peas at a temporary shop at the department store Selfridges in London.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, teapot and teacup plushies were among the items sold at special outlets in Beijing and Shanghai last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, the UK-based firm's revenue rose by two-thirds to £333m ($459m), <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98dr6yj8dlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">according to its most recent Companies House accounts</a>. In the same period, it sold about $117m worth of toys to Chinese consumers on major e-commerce platforms, according to estimates by Beijing-based Moojing Market Intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company's growing popularity mirrors a wider boom in China's collectable-toy market among young adults seeking emotional comfort and connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall sales of collectable toys in China are expected to top 110bn yuan this year, according to a 2024 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Animation Association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The runaway success of Labubu, the elf-like dolls created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, highlights the country's growing appetite for collectable toys, especially among young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd04md5rx1no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">This \"kidult\" trend</a> is not unique to China, as young adults around the world question \"outdated understandings of adulthood\", says Prof Erica Kanesaka, a cultural expert at Emory University in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global toy sales fell in 2024 - albeit by less than 1% - but collectable toy sales rose by almost 5%, to a record high, according to market research company Circana.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Customers shop at jellycat doll store in Shanghai, China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jellycat had pop-up stores in Shanghai and Beijing</figcaption></p></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Jellycat Chinese actress Yang Mi, in a white top, holds a matcha latte plushie at the Jellycat pop-up store in Shanghai\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Jellycat</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In September, Jellycat partnered with A-list actress Yang Mi during a pop-up event in Shanghai</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amuseables, especially the aubergine, which Chinese fans call \"the boss\", have also spawned memes, with many sharing frustrations about adult life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Aubergine boss\" is a hashtag on RedNote, where fans draw different expressions on the plushie. In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it. She then posted a picture of it on Threads with the caption: \"The mental state of workers on Monday.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I kept working at home even when I was supposed to be off,\" the 30-something marketing professional says. \"I just wanted to express how exhausted I was.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jellycat has become an unexpected, light-hearted outlet for young Chinese people to air their grievances about a slowing economy, where hard work doesn't guarantee comparable rewards. Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt. China's youth unemployment rate has eased a little after hitting a record high in August, but official figures show it is still above 17%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have to consider for a long time before buying a luxury bag,\" 34-year-old medical sales representative Jessie Chen says. \"But you don't need to do that for a Jellycat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jellycat also sells bags, which cost just a few hundred yuan [tens of US dollars]. They are practical and can hold a lot of things, so you might change the way you think about luxury goods.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Quitting the pit'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China may have already reached peak Jellycat, with fans noticing less discussion about the toys on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Hui has turned to \"blind boxes\" of toys like Teletubbies - where customers only find out what they have bought when they open the package - as a more thrilling, and cheaper, alternative. She has even considered \"quitting the pit\" - Chinese slang for retiring a hobby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is so difficult to buy them,\" Stella says. \"Our daily life is not easy already and why should we make things harder for ourselves?\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
