Both of them were terrible,\" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties. Trump's remarks are the latest sign his administration is taking a step back on its operations in Minnesota.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pulled the Minnesota mission's leader and figurehead, Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, from the state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS said it was deploying the White House's border tsar, Tom Homan, to take over there and Homan was set to meet with local officials this week. On Tuesday, Homan posted on social media that he had met with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, and local law enforcement officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to other reporters ahead of a rally in Iowa Tuesday night, Trump said he viewed the killing of Pretti, an intensive care nurse at a veterans' hospital, as \"a very unfortunate incident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked by reporters about whether he agreed with characterisations of Pretti as a \"domestic terrorist,\" Trump said: \"I haven't heard that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump then added: \"He shouldn't have been carrying a gun.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti was shot because he was \"brandishing\" a gun during a confrontation, but local authorities said the gun was legally registered and that Pretti was shot after the firearm was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS has also said the agents fired in self-defence, after Pretti resisted attempts to disarm him. Eyewitnesses and local officials, though, have challenged that account, saying he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He wasn't there to peacefully protest, he was there to perpetuate violence,\" Noem said in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, accusing Pretti of \"domestic terrorism\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti's death, coming two weeks after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good, enraged local residents and sparked fresh calls from state and city officials for the Trump administration to withdraw its 3,000 immigration agents and officers from the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the interview with Fox News, Trump appeared to defend the Minnesota operation, saying \"we took thousands of hardened criminals\" out of the state, \"so they have good crime numbers.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's all working out, we have Tom Homan there now,\" he said, before adding the administration would \"de-escalate\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stephen Miller, a top White House aide working on the administration's deportation initiative, told CNN that the White House \"provided clear guidance to DHS that the extra personnel that had been sent to Minnesota for force protection should be used for conducting fugitive operations to create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are evaluating why the [US Customs and Border Patrol] team may not have been following that protocol,\" Miller said in his statement to CNN.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican leaders and lawmakers have called for an investigation into Pretti's death, including Vermont Governor Phil Scott and US Senator Pete Ricketts of Nebraska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The nation witnessed a horrifying situation this weekend,\" Ricketts wrote on X. While he reaffirmed his \"support for funding ICE remains the same,\" Ricketts said he expected \"a prioritized, transparent investigation into this incident\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A federal judge has blocked DHS from destroying or altering evidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his speech at the Iowa rally on Tuesday night, which was dedicated to his economic policies, Trump did not discuss the current situation in Minnesota in-depth, but talked about his immigration crackdown more broadly, citing a Harvard Harris poll from December that suggested 80% of Americans support his administration's efforts to deport illegal immigrants who have committed crimes.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The man was immediately arrested and forensics were being conducted at the scene, police added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I thought it was her aide handing her something,\" Jacquelynn Goessling said of the irritant that was sprayed in Omar's direction, the smell of which consumed the front part of the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement posted on X, Omar said: \"I'm ok. I'm a survivor so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don't let bullies win.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the incident, Omar told the room that \"we will continue... we are Minnesota strong\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video from the scene shows the team shouting \"make a hole\" as they wrestled the man out of the room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he was pushed out of the room, he said that Omar was \"pitting us against each other\". It was not immediately clear who the man was referring to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on social media, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said: \"Violence and intimidation have no place in Minneapolis. We can disagree without putting people at risk... This kind of behavior will not be tolerated in our city.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2019, Omar became the first Somali-American, first African-born American, and one of the first two Muslim American women <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-47238450\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">to serve in the US Congress</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The event was one of the regular town halls hosted by Omar, and about 100 people were in attendance in the north Minneapolis basement, expecting to hear about the presence of federal immigration officials in their town and ask questions after the second fatal shooting of an American citizen by immigration officials this month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January an immigration officer fatally shot US citizen Renee Good. Last week, US citizen Alex Pretti, was fatally shot after being stopped by border agents this past weekend, reigniting local protests and public outcry. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the town hall, Omar called for ICE to be \"abolished\" and said Department of Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem should \"resign or face impeachment.\" It was after these comments that the man attacked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials pleaded with the Congresswoman to end the town hall but she insisted on continuing.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking again at the podium Omar said, \"We're gonna keep talking. Just give me ten minutes. Please don't let them have the show. Please don't let them have the show.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many in the area see the increased immigration enforcement action as a response to President Donald Trump's dislike of Omar who he has called \"radical left lunatic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, responding to the second fatal shooting, Trump said his administration was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q425vg4qzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">\"going to de-escalate a little bit\"</a> in Minnesota. </p></div></div></body></html>"

under the Obama administration - he held a little-known but influential post heading the Enforcement and Removal Operations arm of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homan had planned to retire in 2017, just days before Trump's first administration began. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An abrupt call at his retirement party from incoming Chief of Staff John Kelly changed those plans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I remember him saying, I know it was bad timing, but the president-elect wanted me to stay and run [ICE],\" Homan recalled in an interview last year with the Daily Caller. \"Monday morning, I called [Kelly] and said I want to come back.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A similar call, this time from current Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, again brought him out of retirement in 2024 ahead of the second administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While \"border tsar\" is an informal term and position, it refers to an executive-branch role overseeing border and immigration policy across multiple agencies. It is not Senate confirmed, and is a policy position directly appointed by the serving president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far in Trump's second term, Homan has been a vocal defender of the president's broad deportation goals, vowing to target the \"worst of the worst\" and challenge the notion that \"those who enforce the law are the bad guys and those who break the law are the victims\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in practice, enforcing immigration laws and attempting to focus on public safety threats has also ensnared other undocumented migrants who have no criminal background - a fact that Homan acknowledges and blames on \"sanctuary cities\" that do not work with federal immigration efforts. Officials have said the act of being in the US illegally is a crime in itself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not going to instruct ICE not to arrest [someone] unless there's a serious crime,\" he told reporters in July at the White House, where he makes regular appearances. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What message does that send the whole world? Go ahead and enter the country,\" Homan added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, the White House swiftly came to Homan's defence after reports emerged that he was accused in a bribery case that was ultimately dropped by the justice department when Trump returned to office. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described that case - which allegedly saw Homan accept $50,000 (£36,3000) from undercover agents - as an effort to \"entrap\" a key Trump ally. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Who is Greg Bovino and why is he being replaced?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33b7/live/14519510-fba2-11f0-a1ee-f9a3598885a9.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Gregory Bovino alongside border patrol officers in Minneapolis in January 2026. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gregory Bovino's aggressive tactics have sparked controversy and criticism from lawmakers - including Republicans. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Homan, Bovino has spent almost his entire law enforcement career in border cities, having first joined Border Patrol in 1996 and serving in a variety of US domestic postings as well as overseas in Honduras and Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The North Carolina native rose to prominence in Trump's second term, taking the lead during immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago, New Orleans and Minneapolis. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino has been serving as \"commander-at-large\" in Border Patrol - an informal role outside of the organisation's formal hierarchy. Border Patrol is one of several immigration-centred agencies that operates under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino reportedly answers directly to DHS head Kristi Noem. In his informal role, he works alongside officials like the Chief of Border Patrol, a position held by Michael Banks, and the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, a position currently held by Rodney Scott.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino's tactics have been both controversial, particularly the aggressive \"turn and burn\" method of making swift arrests before protesters can arrive to an area. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're going to turn and burn to that next target and the next and the next and the next,\" he told the AP of the tactic. \"We're not going to stop.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino has also earned a reputation as an official willing to clash with lawmakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, for example, Bovino has publicly sparred with lawmakers from both parties who expressed concern about his operations in Minneapolis. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will leadership switch mean change in Minneapolis?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino being replaced with Homan in Minneapolis is seen by some political observers as recognition from the White House that an urgent change was needed amid growing public concern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In practice, however, that change is ultimately unlikely to alter the administration's approach to immigration enforcement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Homan has more years at ICE and doing interior enforcement,\" former DHS immigration official Lora Ries told the BBC of his work in many American cities not near the border. \"This isn't a surprise to me.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ries, now head of the border security and immigration centre at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation in Washington, added that while Homan has said he's sought to focus \"on the worst, first\", all deportable undocumented migrants will continue to be \"on the table\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For immigration activists, Homan's career - which has included staunch defence of Trump's family separation policy, which led to separating children from parents who are in the country illegally - also means that they see little practical difference between him and Bovino. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not sure it means much. Homan is a career deportation advocate, and the architect of family separation,\" said Michael Lukens, the executive director of the Amica Center, an organisation which helps immigrants with legal access and services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the difference is that he is more polished than Bovino. He is better at speaking to the press, and stakeholders,\" he added. \"He's better for what they need, someone to paint their actions as not what they are.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is much more about whether the White House sees this as a political issue, not a human one,\" Lukens added. \"But there is no world in which Homan is a moderate.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A New York Times/Siena poll out last Friday found that 61 percent of voters believe ICE's tactics have \"gone too far.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The survey came out two weeks after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Renee Good, a US citizen, was fatally shot</a> by a federal agent in Minneapolis, and one day before <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg50vv1ezko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">another American citizen, Alex Prett</a>i, was killed by agents in the city, sparking nationwide protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the face of public outcry over the killings, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security &amp; Governmental Affairs, called on Monday for the leaders of ICE and two other federal agencies to testify before his panel next month. The request came alongside calls from other Senate Republicans for more oversight of ICE after Pretti's shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The tragedy and chaos the country is witnessing in Minneapolis is shocking,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska wrote on social media. \"ICE agents do not have carte blanche in carrying out their duties.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murkowski's condemnation does not come as a major surprise. The Alaska moderate is one of a small handful of Republicans in Congress who've been willing to openly criticise Trump since he first entered office. Paul also has clashed with the president and administration on issues in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina on Tuesday became one of the first prominent Republicans to call for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to step down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noem \"has proven to be way out of her depth,\" Tillis told reporters, adding that her leadership in Minnesota \"should be disqualifying.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has said Trump has confidence in Noem.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Facing 'serious, unanswered questions'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moderate Republicans like Murkowski aren't the only ones in the party criticising the immigration operation in Minnesota. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days some of Trump's allies in Congress also began speaking out against the shootings, though most issued carefully worded statements that didn't explicitly mention the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are serious unanswered questions about federal use of force in Minnesota. Transparency and accountability are essential,\" said Representative Max Miller of Ohio, a former Trump adviser.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative Andrew Garbarino of New York, the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, called on the heads of ICE and other agencies to testify before Congress. Garbarino also came out in support of a full investigation into Pretti's shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Congress has an important responsibility to ensure the safety of law enforcement and the people they serve and protect,\" Garbarino said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senator Ted Cruz of Texas issued a more direct criticism of the administration after the Pretti shooting. But he focused on the administration's rhetoric in response to the shooting and didn't break with Trump's larger agenda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What I think the administration could do better is the tone with which they're describing this - that immediately when an incident like this happens, they come out guns blazing that we took out a violent terrorist, hooray,\" Cruz said Monday on his podcast, Verdict with Ted Cruz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Republican response also is complicated by the gun ownership debate that has pitted the administration against the National Rifle Association, a traditional ally of the political right. A Trump-appointed federal prosecutor in Los Angeles said in a social media post after Pretti's death that people who approach law enforcement officials armed should expect that there is a \"high likelihood\" they'll get shot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NRA slammed the remarks. \"Responsible public voices should be awaiting a full investigation, not making generalisations and demonising law-abiding citizens,\" the NRA said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some Republican lawmakers defend immigration enforcement underway in Minneapolis and other US cities. Trump's immigration policies remain popular with the party's base, and after the recent shootings in Minneapolis some Republican voters in the state told the BBC they didn't think the president should do anything differently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're just doing their job, which is right,\" Jay Cielinski, said of ICE in an interview Tuesday in his hometown of Zimmerman, a roughly 50-minute drive north of Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 59-year-old home inspector and self-described Trump supporter also said protesters, and state and local officials shouldn't interfere with federal immigration operations, a view echoed by many Republicans including Trump and other senior administration officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They should stay at home, stay out of the way,\" Cielinski said of people who protest federal immigration operations. \"Law enforcement officials at the city, state, county [levels] should be encouraging ICE to go in. They should expose the people that are illegal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the cautious rebukes from Cruz and other prominent Republicans in Washington signaled an attempt to hold the administration accountable without alienating supporters like Cielinski.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Pivoting to a softer approach</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The growing criticisms from Republican lawmakers came as Trump shifted his own tone in recent days after more facts emerged about the circumstances surrounding Pretti's death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the shooting Trump initially called Pretti a \"gunman,\" and other senior US officials claimed the 37-year-old ICU nurse had turned up armed at an enforcement action to try and kill federal agents. But others have disputed that, saying Pretti was filming ICE agents with his phone then helping a woman pushed on the ground, and that he was not armed when he was shot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn9q1wp0yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump has since softened</a> his rhetoric, and taken steps to try and ease tensions in Minneapolis. This week, he sent White House border tsar Tom Homan to take over the operation there, known as Operation Metro Surge. Homan's arrival represented a shakeup in leadership, as top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino is expected to leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump suggested on Tuesday that sending Homan to Minneapolis was intended to bring calm there. \"We're going to de-escalate a little bit,\" Trump said in a Fox News interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president also held calls on Monday with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both of whom are Democrats. Frey said afterwards that Trump told him the \"present situation\" in Minneapolis can't continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House officials pulled back their rhetoric, too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"It is President Trump's hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos to end today.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remarks appear to have opened the doors for more Republicans to voice concern about the shootings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the party's future approach to its immigration messaging remains to be seen - both in the run-up to the midterms later this year and in the aftermath of the violence in Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Already, there are signs of a shutdown battle over immigration policy that could push lawmakers into their partisan camps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senate Democrats vowed to block a spending package if it includes additional funding for DHS, setting the stage for a possible government shutdown later this week. The fight could pressure Trump's party to defend his immigration agenda and overshadow Republican calls for investigations into the shootings in Minneapolis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans also will likely continue taking their cues from Trump. How he responds will shape the debate in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"ana-faguy-and-kristina-volk-contributed-reporting-from-minneapolis.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Ana Faguy and Kristina Volk contributed reporting from Minneapolis.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU.

Washington has changed. There's almost nothing normal in the United States. That's the truth\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Fox News interview on Monday, Bessent criticised Canada's decision to negotiate a trade deal with China. He added that he was \"not sure what the Prime Minister was thinking\" when he made his speech in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Canada depends on the US,\" Bessent said. \"There's much more north-south trade then there could ever be east-west trade.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The prime minister should do what's best for the Canadian people rather than try to push his globalist agenda,\" the treasury secretary added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His remarks came after Trump threatened Canada with 100% tariffs on its goods if it allows Chinese goods to flow freely to the US, skirting levies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal between Ottawa and Beijing would lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by March, while Canada will tax a limited number of Chinese electric vehicles, or EVs, at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1% – down from 100%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney said that Canada is not pursuing a free-trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters on Monday, Carney added that he believed Trump's latest tariff threat is a negotiation tactic ahead of talks on USMCA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The president is a strong negotiator, and I think some of these comments and positioning should be viewed in the broader context of that,\" he said.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained \"no factual arguments\", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot.

Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are \"fairly confident\" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a \"Category 5 disease\".

He has also been sentenced to five years in jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to Yoon's shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said while delivering the verdict, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was during a year-long probe into Yoon's failed martial law attempt that special prosecutors started investigating many of the allegations against Kim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Together, the once-powerful-couple make a historic pair: while South Korea has a history of former presidents being indicted and imprisoned, Yoon and Kim mark the first time both a former president and former first lady have been jailed.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

She now lives with a Ghanaian mother who introduces her as her own daughter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My Ghanaian identity is not pretend,\" she says. \"It is not cosplay. It is ancestral. Like Kwame Nkrumah said: 'I am not African because I was born in Africa, but because Africa was born in me.' That is exactly what Ghana is to me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her prosthetic leg itself is a declaration of that love.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wrapped in kente, it is as much a cultural symbol as it is a mobility aid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It always has been, and always will be, kente,\" she says. \"It represents my love for this country, its heritage, its pride.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Living with a disability in Ghana has brought a new mission into her life, one that goes far beyond personal expression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Abena, the difference between how disabled people are treated in the US and Ghana comes down to visibility and access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the States, progress is happening, slowly, imperfectly, but happening. Disabled people are being invited into more spaces,\" she explains. \"It is still ableist, but at least there is an attempt to change the narrative.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ghana, she says, is still at the beginning of that journey. Not for lack of compassion, but for lack of representation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After her move, she continued to speak out for the rights of people with disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Ghana, disabled people have not been widely showcased in a positive light,\" she says. \"So stigma thrives. Negativity thrives. People do not see us in powerful or beautiful or joyful positions, they see us only in struggle.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her advocacy is built on changing that perception. Not with pity, but with visibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With her kente prosthetic, unfiltered personality and refusal to shrink herself to fit public expectations, Abena wants Ghanaians to see disabled people as they are: ambitious, stylish, talented, complex, proud and human.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Disability is not a limitation.

She wanted to open the door to a different kind of representation, to force a conversation the country had delayed for too long.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I knew it would be a monumental moment for Rhythms on the Runway and for Ghana,\" she says. \"If I wanted inclusivity in the industry, I had to be willing to take that first step.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And she did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When she stepped onto the runway, draped in fabric and confidence, her prosthetic gleaming under the spotlights, the room shifted. What happened next became one of the most talked about moments of the night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Her strength showed right through, speaking volumes. 'I am differently able and I have got this,'\" Tourism, Culture and Arts Minister Abla Dzifa Gomashie said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Her walk was not just a performance it was a powerful affirmation that talent, beauty, and confidence know no limitations. We are proud to have provided a platform where her light could shine so boldly,\" fashion show organiser Shirley Emma Tibilla said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Abena's presence was absolutely powerful. This is what true inclusion looks like, celebrating every story, everybody, and every ability,\" Dentaa Amoateng, entrepreneur and founder of the Guba diaspora investment awards added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Abena, the significance of the evening was not the applause. It was the message. Disabled people were not just spectators that night, they were centre stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing at the intersection of identity, disability, heritage and fashion, Abena represents a new way forward for Ghana, one where inclusion is not quietly suggested, but boldly demanded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her journey from a two-year-old cancer patient to a woman reshaping how Ghana sees disability is not a story of survival, it is a story of reclamation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She reclaimed her identity, reclaimed her mobility, reclaimed her belonging and reclaimed her place in a country that, in her words, \"fought for me before I even stepped foot here\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her work is far from finished. But whether she is on a runway, behind a microphone, or mentoring young amputees, one thing is constant, she refuses to dim her light. And she refuses to let others like her be dimmed either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ghana is my home,\" she says.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa doYqeg\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">You may also be interested in:</span></div></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It is so powerful that when Deng Xiaoping was the paramount leader of the country during the 1980s, this was the only position he held for most of that time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That only Xi and one CMC general remain is unprecedented, according to Lyle Morris from the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The PLA is in disarray,\" he told the BBC, adding that China's military now had \"a major leadership void\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what was really driving the culling of so many top generals, he said: \"There are a lot of rumours floating around. We don't know, at this point, what is true and what is false… but it is certainly bad for Xi Jinping, for his leadership and control over the PLA.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore also said he was not sure what the real reason was for Zhang's downfall but that there was a lot of speculation about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everything from leaking nuclear secrets to the United States to plotting a coup and factional infighting. There are even rumours of a gunfight in Beijing,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But Zhang and Liu's downfall along with the wild speculation highlight two things: that Xi remains unassailable and there are significant limits to information in Beijing which fuels uncertainty and feeds this speculation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The official announcement that said Zhang and Liu were \"under investigation\" also said that they were accused of \"serious violations of discipline and law\", which is a euphemism for corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then the PLA Daily made this absolutely clear in an editorial, writing that this move showed the Communist Party's \"zero tolerance\" approach to \"punishing corruption… no matter who it is or how high their position\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The specific allegations being made against all of these generals have not been released to the public and may never be. However, that they have been named as under investigation almost certainly means being given a custodial sentence as a minimum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The PLA Daily editorial was already speaking of Zhang and Liu as if they were guilty, saying they had \"seriously betrayed the trust and expectations of the Communist Party's Central Committee\" as well as \"trampling on and undermining the Central Military Commission\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of the generals may be about corruption, but it may also be about power politics, given how these purges have panned out in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China definitely had a corruption problem when Xi Jinping came to power, but its leader has also been accused of using his anti-corruption drive, deploying the Party's feared discipline inspection teams, to take out would-be political rivals or those in government ranks showing anything short of full loyalty to him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has given General Secretary Xi a level of unchallenged control not seen since Chairman Mao.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet this type of leadership can also be counterproductive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the military, for example, a climate of suspicion can lead to cautious – even weak – decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zhang's father was a revolutionary comrade of Xi's father. The general goes back a long way with Xi and that they were seen as close allies before the turmoil of recent days has possibly made this worse because of a belief that no-one is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was also one of only a handful of senior officers in the PLA with combat experience, making his loss significant for the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His removal also poses longer term problems for Xi, according to Morris.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi may have stamped his authority, yet again, but the upheaval means ongoing frictions, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's certainly a bad look for Xi and I think there's going to be significant turmoil in the PLA, with Xi and his leaders – especially in the PLA – for years to come.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The purging of the most senior generals also brings scrutiny on the next layer of officers who may be wondering who is next?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the fate of those above they also may not welcome promotion into the deadly zone where Xi's anti-corruption spotlight can be trained on you at any time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And all this has come at a time when Beijing is increasing pressure on Taiwan with threats to, at some point, seize the self-governing island via an all-out attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts will be weighing up just how much these removals have hampered such a possibility - though some think it will have little impact on curbing Beijing's ambitions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The purge does not affect the PRC's ambitions to control Taiwan. That comes down to the CCP as a whole and Xi specifically,\" said Chong. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where the purge may matter are operational decisions. Without top military professionals or military professionals who are cowed, decisions about escalation and aggression toward Taiwan will centre even more on Xi, his preferences, and proclivities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-yvette-tan\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Yvette Tan</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

While he blamed the Democrats, many on both sides of America's political divide will agree that the current situation is fraught with peril.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The initial administration response to Pretti's death was straightforward. The 37-year-old was portrayed as a domestic terrorist bent on bloodshed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Pretti wished to \"inflict harm\" and was \"brandishing\" a weapon. US Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said that it \"looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior presidential adviser Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This White House has typically been quick to push back when criticised. \"Deny and attack\" has long been a bedrock Trump strategy for handling adversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, perhaps tellingly, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to echo Miller's comments herself on Monday when pressed on whether the president agreed with his senior adviser. Instead, she said a full investigation would be carried out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a notably more muted tone than that struck immediately after the shooting.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BBC at protests outside hotel where Trump's immigration chief believed to be staying</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That initial response had echoed the path the administration took three weeks ago, when federal law enforcement shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. They said Good was a terrorist who had \"weaponised\" her vehicle in an attempt to injure ICE agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As with Good's case, the federal government's version of events has been challenged by local officials, eyewitnesses and the victim's family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Sunday, Pretti's parents asked for the truth to come out, adding: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple videos of Saturday's deadly encounter contradict many of the administration's initial claims. The footage shows Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone and helping a woman who is pushed over before both are pepper-sprayed. Pretti is visibly not holding a gun when he is wrestled to the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS says Pretti had a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two magazines of ammunition. Local police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner. Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Unpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time around, the administration's initial response quickly had become difficult for the administration to maintain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People have had enough,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said, noting that his officers made hundreds of arrests of violent offenders last year without resorting to shooting. \"This is not sustainable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans in Washington DC and elsewhere have expressed growing unease with how the administration was handling the situation. Vermont Governor Phil Scott called the federal efforts in Minnesota \"a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training and leadership\" – at best.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At worst, he said, it was \"deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Utah Senator John Curtis criticised Noem's \"premature\" response to the shooting, which he said \"came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence\" in the law enforcement mission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland security chairmen in both the House and Senate say they plan to hold public hearings</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Sunday night, there has been a marked change in tone from the White House. Veteran's Affairs Secretary Doug Collins offered condolences to the Pretti family. The president posted a message on his Truth Social website calling the death \"tragic\" and blaming it on \"Democrat ensued chaos\" – a message echoed by Vice-President JD Vance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday morning, Trump posted that he was dispatching \"border czar\" Tom Homan to Minnesota to direct law-enforcement efforts there. Homan, who handled deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration, is considered a more measured, politically attuned operator less prone to the kind of bombastic declarations recently made by Noem and Bovino.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,\" Trump wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Homan's assignment to Minneapolis may not necessarily reflect a change in policy – this administration has yet to show signs of backing away from its aggressive immigration enforcement – it could be a change in presentation, as the president tries to come to grips with a public mood that opinion surveys suggest is souring on how his immigration crackdown is being carried out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a CBS survey taken before the weekend's shooting, 61% of respondents said that ICE is being \"too tough when stopping and detaining people\", while 58% disapproved of his handling of immigration as a whole.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA Trump's border czar Tom Homan appears in pensive mood as he hold his hand to his face and stares into the distance in a close-up photo taken in the White House grounds.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump is sending Tom Homan to oversee the immigration operation in Minnesota</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked by BBC News about Homan's involvement, said that he may provide a new avenue to work with the administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't want to foreclose the possibility that reasonable minds can prevail,\" he added, \"but we are here exactly because the federal government had unreasonable positions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another potential thaw came when Trump announced on Monday that he had spoken with Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a very good call,\" Trump wrote. \"We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That represents a marked cooling of what had been a series of heated exchanges between the two men in recent weeks – and could portend the kind of de-escalation in Minnesota that many politicians have been calling for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That may not be enough for Washington Democrats, however, who have come under increasing pressure to draw a bright line against the Trump administration's rhetoric and policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senate Democrats have announced they will now block that funding measure in their chamber, which would trigger a partial government shutdown on Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,\" said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. \"These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such a move is not without its own political risks, however. Democrats triggered a record-setting shutdown last autumn over health care subsidies but ultimately relented with little to show for it. And they will also be wary of pushing too far on immigration and law and order, two issues where they poll poorly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, both Republicans and Democrats are grappling with how to handle what has become an explosive situation. At stake is the public perception of Trump's immigration policy, a core political issue for the president and one that helped him win back the White House.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz described Pretti as \"someone who went to work to care for veterans, someone who was a valued co-worker, someone who relished and lived in this state in a big way, whether it was outdoor activities or being down there on the street as a First Amendment witness to what ICE is doing to this state.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos have emerged showing a scuffle between Border Patrol agents and Pretti just before the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify analysed multiple videos showing the moments just before the shooting. They show Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone. One of the agents pushes another person over, and Pretti then stands between that person and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent pepper sprays him in the face and as he tries to help the woman on the floor, more agents join and he is wrestled to the floor. He is visibly not holding a gun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An agent in a grey jacket can be seen reaching to remove something from Pretti's waist. He then turns away from Pretti, now holding what appears to be a pistol in his right hand, which was previously empty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Less than a second after this, an agent shoots Pretti. Ten shots in total are heard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner. Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In filed testimony, two witnesses challenged the DHS account of what happened, both saying they did not see Pretti brandish a weapon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that the videos were unclear and \"there is a lot we don't see\" in them so it was important to have an investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Unpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Please get the truth out about our son'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti's family said he had no interaction with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets. He had no criminal record, AP reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to videos that suggested their son was a \"domestic terrorist,\" Pretti's family said: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pointing to the video evidence, which does not show a gun in Pretti's hand when he was tackled by federal agents, they added: \"Please get the truth out about our son.

He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Canadian PM, Mark Carney, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, stands at a microphone in front of a blue backdrop bearing the words World Economic Forum.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient.

There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth.

But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to.

I think I did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the moments before the shooting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him.

This year, it will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has invited them as chief guests for the celebrations, placing the European Union at the centre of one of the country's most prestigious state events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this day, India turns the heart of its capital into a stage.

The chief guests have been from leaders of neighbouring countries - such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka - to heads of state and government from major powers, including the US and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has featured as the chief guest five times - including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - reflecting the long and complex history between the two countries.

It was the first time a regional grouping was invited - marking 25 years of India's engagement with the bloc, Pant added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, some absences from the guest list have also reflected strained relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistani leaders attended twice as chief guests before the neighbours went to war in 1965. Islamabad has not been invited thereafter - a sign of continuing strain in ties. The only time China attended was when Marshal Ye Jianying came in 1958, four years before the two countries went to war over their disputed border. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the significance of Republic Day extends beyond diplomacy and guest lists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Indian President Abdul Kalam (R), Russian President Vladimir Putin (2R) and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (L) watch Indian army jets flying over India's 58th Republic Day parade from a bullet-proof box, in New Delhi, 26 January 2007. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the Republic Day parade in 2007</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts says India's parade stands apart from similar military displays elsewhere in the world for a number of reasons. The fact that India has a guest almost every year is one of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, for most countries, these parades commemorate military victories. Like <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61332283\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Russia's Victory Day</a> marks the defeat of Germany in World War Two, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-36808199\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">France's Bastille Day</a> celebrates the start of the French Revolution and the eventual fall of the monarchy, and China's military parade marks their victory over Japan in World War Two. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's celebration, by contrast, is centred on the constitution, says Pant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many other countries, these celebrations are related to victories in war. We don't celebrate that. We celebrate becoming a constitutional democracy - the coming into effect of the constitution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike military parades in many Western capitals, India's Republic Day also blends displays of its military capability with cultural performances and regional tableaux, projecting both power and diversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beyond strategy and symbolism, the parade often leaves a more personal impression on visiting leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former official who spoke anonymously recalled how the Obamas were particularly struck by the camel-mounted contingents - a moment that stayed with them long after the formal ceremonies ended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-bbc-persian.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting BBC Persian.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"
