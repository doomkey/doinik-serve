In return, the US says Russia would withdraw elsewhere and there would be a cessation of fighting. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this is an unpalatable option for Zelensky, who refuses to reward Moscow for its aggression and who has repeatedly warned that Russia would use any foothold in the eastern regions to launch future assaults on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Americans are inclined, in principle, to finding a compromise,\" Zelensky said on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the issue of security guarantees - which Ukraine wants to ensure Russia would be deterred from carrying out future attacks in the event of a peace deal - had yet to be resolved. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the UK prime minister's office said: \"The leaders all agreed that now is a critical moment and that we must continue to ramp up support to Ukraine and economic pressure on Putin to bring an end to this barbaric war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The leaders discussed the importance of the US-led peace talks for European security and supported the progress made,\" the statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leaders also \"underscored the need for a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, which includes robust security guarantees\", it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of the talks he hosted at Downing Street, Starmer said there needed to be \"hard-edged security guarantees\" in a peace deal for Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Merz stated he was \"sceptical\" about some of the details of the potential plan coming from the US side. \"But we have to talk about it. That's why we are here,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the meeting, France said work would be \"intensified\" to provide security guarantees for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is nervousness in Kyiv and across Europe that the US could end its support of Ukraine over frustration with the slow progress of negotiations. \"We can't manage without Americans, we can't manage without Europe and that is why we need to make some important decisions,\" Zelensky said in London.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\"

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the White House has been pushing Kyiv and Moscow to swiftly agree to a multi-point plan to end the war, there has been little sign of a breakthrough. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A five-hour meeting between US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last week failed to yield tangible results. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those talks were followed by three days of discussions between Zelensky's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov and his US counterparts in Miami, which resulted in vague but positive statements of \"progress\" from both sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, on Sunday Trump accused Zelensky of not having read the draft of the revised deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm a little disappointed that President Zelensky hasn't yet read the proposal,\" he said, while insisting Russia's Vladimir Putin was \"fine with it\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost simultaneously, Zelensky stated that he expected to be briefed on the negotiations by Umerov either in London or Brussels on Monday. \"Some issues can only be discussed in person,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The talks in London were the latest attempt by Ukraine's European allies to carve out a role in the US-led efforts to end the war, which they fear will undercut the long-term interests of the continent in favour of a quick resolution. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite significant economic pressure and sustained battlefield losses, the Kremlin has shown little sign that it is willing to compromise on its key demands, including ruling out any future path to Ukraine joining the Nato military alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, Putin also restated his willingness to continue fighting until his forces take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, 85% of which is currently occupied by the Russian army. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

He has also repeatedly said that Kyiv must determine its own future, not have conditions imposed on it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The big names Starmer hosted in London discussed hugely significant issues - not only for Ukraine's future, but for the security of the continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's concern that if Russia is \"rewarded\" by being given Ukrainian territory as part of a peace deal, it could feel emboldened to attack other European countries in the future.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Monday's talks in London make any meaningful difference to peace negotiations?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The visuals of Europe's arguably most influential nations standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Volodymyr Zelensky in Downing Street tell one story. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But when it comes to Washington, European leaders are walking a tightrope.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpvd01g2kwwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">National Security Strategy published on Friday</a>, the US pointed the finger of blame at Europeans over Ukraine, accusing them of having \"unrealistic expectations\" as to how the war might end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although they have not publicly commented on the document, behind closed doors Europe's leaders fear Donald Trump is keen for a quick fix in Ukraine, so he can turn his attentions elsewhere. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But a quick fix, they worry, will not mean a long-lasting peace - only a temporary pause in Russian aggression in Ukraine and possibly further afield in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent incidents including unmanned drones causing chaos in civilian airports in Germany, Denmark, Belgium and elsewhere, an act of railway sabotage in Poland that could have cost lives and significant cyber-attacks across the continent have all been laid at Russia's door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have brought the war in Ukraine closer to Europeans, however far they are from the front line. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With that has come a sense that Russia would like to weaken their continent as a whole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But we do not hear those European concerns broadcast loudly in public.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the most part, leaders continue to praise Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Starmer said the US president had progressed peace negotiations \"the furthest we've got in the four years\" in just a few weeks. He added that talks were complicated, but progress was being made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested that he was \"sceptical about some of the details which we are seeing in the documents coming from the US side\",  but added \"we have to talk about it\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact is, European leaders don't want to provoke the US president over differences on how to achieve peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Donald Trump has flip-flopped dramatically in his attitudes towards Kyiv since he returned to the White House. He has a pretty tempestuous relationship with Volodymyr Zelensky, whereas he has often praised Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has already stopped direct aid to Ukraine - although it still provides much-needed intelligence to its military and allows European countries to purchase US weapons which are then sent on to Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European nations are not in a position to support Ukraine militarily without the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After decades of under-investment in their militaries, they are not in a position to take on the security and defence of their own continent alone, either.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US is the biggest and most powerful member of Nato. Europe looks to Washington for intelligence, command and control capabilities, for air force capabilities - such as air-to-air refuelling - and much more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite a pledge to Donald Trump at a Nato summit a few months ago to vastly increase defence spending (and Trump is far from the first US president to ask for that), Europe cannot practically become militarily independent overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European governments are currently facing considerable budgetary constraints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, talk of struggling and failing public services are common. In France - which has long been in the throes of a huge budgetary crisis - next year's draft budget only sets €120m (£105m) in civilian and military aid for Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is because of these limitations that - in public - the concerns about Washington and a peace plan for Ukraine are so carefully expressed by Europe's leaders. They don't want to risk being left completely alone by the power they still describe as their greatest ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the differences in the European and US approaches to Moscow are glaring.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Europeans – particularly in countries bordering Russia - view Moscow as a destabilising threat, in its National Security Strategy the Trump administration talked up the importance of building \"strategic stability\" with Russia, and questioned Europe's longer-term reliability as an ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe's leaders are trying to avoid further alienating the US president, while fighting for Ukrainian sovereignty and future continental stability. It's a tortuous dance.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) does not have aircraft. It launches drone strikes, but drones were excluded from the research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RSF has been internationally condemned for allegedly carrying out ethnic massacres in Sudan's western Darfur region, triggering charges of genocide by the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The RSF are being held responsible for a lot of damage and violations, and I think rightly so,\" says Mark Snoeck, who ran the project. \"But I think the SAF should also be held accountable for their actions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The military has also faced international criticism, accused of indiscriminate bombings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SAF did not respond to a BBC request for comment. But it has previously denied allegations of targeting civilians, saying its airstrikes are \"directed solely at RSF gatherings, locations and bases recognized as legitimate military targets\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness is an initiative by the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a non-profit group which works to expose human rights violations. It received funding from the British foreign ministry for this project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an advance copy of the report obtained by the BBC, Sudan Witness analysed 384 airstrikes conducted between April 2023 and July 2025.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 1,700 civilians were reported killed and 1,120 injured in the incidents it documented. The group says these are conservative figures as it takes the lowest reported number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were 135 cases involving residential areas, with verified destruction to homes and civilian infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 35 instances the bombs struck markets and commercial facilities, often when they were crowded with people. And 19 strikes affected vulnerable groups in places like health facilities, sites housing displaced people and educational institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness acknowledges that its research is incomplete because the results reflect access to data rather than the total number of strikes. It's hard to get information from conflict zones due to poor telecommunications and the difficulty of identifying credible sources, it says, and strikes on military targets are likely to be underreported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it says through a rigorous methodology, it has been able to build a wider picture of the military's air campaigns, visualising the information in an interactive map that shows the scale and impact on civilian populations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For us to say that the Sudanese Armed Forces conducted an airstrike on a certain location at a certain time would more or less require that the SAF be caught in the act in footage that can be verified,\" says Mr Snoeck. \"And this would be a very high threshold, because footage like that is very exceptional in Sudan. So what we therefore have done is analysed hundreds of airstrikes claims to paint the bigger picture.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The main patterns that emerge are repeated hits on residential neighbourhoods and markets, says Mr Snoeck, as well as a large number of alleged strikes on essential humanitarian and medical facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think these patterns strongly suggest that the SAF isn't doing enough to avoid civilian casualties,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Justin Lynch, managing director at Conflict Insights Group which tracks foreign weapons supplies to Sudan, told the BBC that Sudanese civilians were bearing the brunt of the battles between the army and the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sudan's conflict is really a war against civilians,\" he told the BBC. \"Air power and other heavy weapons disproportionately target civilian, more than military, sites.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness calculates the credibility level of a reported airstrike based on publicly available digital information known as open source.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It assesses the reliability of the source, ability to analyse the location through videos posted to social media, and available satellite imagery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of the incidents examined by Sudan Witness could be based only on reports. Where it was able to find corroborating evidence, it confirmed the attacks with a low-to-medium degree of certainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the group highlights cases where munitions, impact craters or shrapnel damage are identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one such instance Sudan Witness confirmed multiple videos and images showing a crater with an undetonated air-dropped bomb in the Zamzam camp for displaced people in North Darfur.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1e67/live/f483e420-d44d-11f0-8b57-d3fa96717fb2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Facebook The twisted shell of a bomb is covered in dust and lies in a crater.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Facebook</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A photographer in Zamzam camp captured this image of an unexploded bomb that fell there last year</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appeared to match the SH-250 unguided munition produced by Military Industry Corporation, a Sudanese arms manufacturer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is still one of the most troubling findings I've worked on,\" says Mr Snoeck. \"Why drop an unguided bomb on a camp for internally displaced people?

The World Health Organisation and UN children's charity Unicef reported 16 civilians were killed, including three children and one healthcare worker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a rebel group allied to the army criticised this strike. The Sudan Tribune, an independent online news portal, quoted a spokesman for the Justice and Equality Movement, who said citizens were surprised by the indiscriminate airstrikes targeting hospitals and homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city of Nyala in South Darfur state is a frequent target. Its airport is alleged to be the main entry point for RSF weapons, including sophisticated drones, delivered by the United Arab Emirates. Abu Dhabi denies evidence that it is supporting the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SAF says it is targeting military supplies in the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, according to the Sudan War Monitor, a group of researchers who track the conflict, it lacks precision weapons to accurately hit them in such a crowded setting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sudan Witness analysed a series of air strikes in the city centre carried out in February this year, also documented by Human Rights Watch. They hit residential neighbourhoods and a grocery store near an eye hospital, killing at least 63 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group says the strikes on busy marketplaces and commercial hubs not only kill civilians but also disrupt economic stability and aggravate the humanitarian crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October last year at least 65 people were reported killed and 200 injured in a bombing that destroyed the al-Kuma market in North Darfur.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21f8/live/5382ffb0-d458-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A fruit vendor's wares are laid out in front of a partially ruined building.

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another local source said the town had suffered more than 30 air raids since the beginning of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This evidence of military airstrikes hitting marketplaces and other civilian areas, shows a clear and unacceptable disregard for the safety of innocent Sudanese civilians,\" said a British foreign office official. \"Whatever side of the conflict they are on, the perpetrators of these heinous crimes must be held accountable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Sudan Witness Project has continued monitoring air raids beyond July 2025 but says there has been a shift towards drone strikes by both parties in recent months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The devastating cycle of aerial warfare sometimes targets groups seen as supporting the other side, says the Sudan War Monitor, highlighting an alleged SAF drone attack on al-Kuma in October, this time hitting a social gathering at the home of a local religious leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Al-Kuma is predominantly inhabited by the Ziyadiya, one of the Arab nomadic groups that form the social and ethnic backbone of the RSF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That same weekend the RSF launched drone and artillery attacks on el-Fasher, striking a religious displacement centre and reportedly killing at least 60 civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">El-Fasher is dominated by non-Arab groups such as the Zaghawa, which RSF fighters associated with Zaghawa armed groups defending the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Neither side utilises drones and their airpower to primarily target military locations — they are either indiscriminate or designed to terrorise civilian populations under each other's control, which are war crimes,\" says Mr Lynch from Conflict Insights Group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SAF says the RSF seeks refuge within residential neighbourhoods and insists it is strictly observing international humanitarian laws and rules of engagement, including protection of civilians and their properties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both sides in Sudan's war have been accused of war crimes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week the RSF and its ally the Sudan Liberation Movement-North was accused of drone strikes that hit a kindergarten and a hospital in the South Kordofan town of Kalogi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The WHO said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c23e7kyl9myo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">114 people were killed, including 63 children</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Lynch says not only are civilians suffering, neither side is achieving military success in the air war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"SAF have used aerial operations to support the takeover of Khartoum, but with that exception their use of airstrikes has resulted in a lot of civilian death and not a lot of military success,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Similarly, the RSF use foreign mercenaries backed by the UAE to fly drones, but with a few exceptions it hasn't actually achieved results.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.info-res.org/sudan-airstrikes-hub\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i

the companies. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount is a smaller player than Netflix that is known for brands such as CBS News, Nickelodeon and Mission Impossible. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It started submitting offers a few months ago, eventually prompting Warner Bros, owner of HBO and classics from Looney Tunes to Harry Potter, to formally open a bidding process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wall Street analysts have long said they believe a Paramount-Warner Bros combination makes sense, because it would give the company the scale to compete against rivals such as Netflix and Disney. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount was also seen as a strong suitor because the relationship between Trump and the Ellison family, including tech billionaire and Republican megadonor Larry Ellison, was expected to help ease the approval process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Warner Bros declared Netflix the winner of the auction on Friday, announcing a deal that valued its studio and streaming networks, including HBO, at about $83bn (£62.3bn), including its debt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said the sale would proceed after a planned spin-off of other parts of Warner Brothers' business, including CNN, into an independent company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount's offer values the entire company at $108.4bn, which it said was a better deal.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is among the financial partners Paramount is working with as part of the deal, according to paperwork submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix executives on Monday expressed confidence in their plans, dismissing Paramount's attempt as \"entirely expected\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Warner Bros said it would review the offer but was not currently changing its recommendation. It said it would respond within 10 business days. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Trump says he will be \"involved\" in the Warner Brothers merger decision</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Either<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>takeover is expected to face scrutiny from competition regulators in the US and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts said Netflix's plan would likely raise concerns about dominance in streaming, while Paramount's proposal would prompt a review of the impact on advertisers and local television distributors, given the power of a combined company over sports and children's networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Paramount's plans, which would put CBS and CNN under the same parent company, have also been closely watched because of the potential impact on the news business and the Ellisons' ties to Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president said over the weekend he expected to be involved in the approval process. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he has offered little certainty about his views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While noting potential concerns about Netflix's tie-up on Sunday, he also praised the streamer's bosses. Meanwhile on social media on Monday, he took aim at Paramount for a 60 Minutes interview that it aired with former Trump ally Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican representative.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with CNBC, Paramount chief executive David Ellison said he had had \"great conversations\" with Trump about the deal, while noting that he did not want to speak for the president. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netflix is the biggest streaming company in the world, with more than 300 million subscribers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Ellison's plan would build on his purchase earlier this year of Paramount, which he folded into his Skydance film studio. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Paramount ultimately needs this deal more than Netflix,\" said Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, calling the Warner Bros assets simply \"nice to have\" for the streamer.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to CNBC on Monday, Mr Ellison talked up the benefits of his plan for the entire media industry, arguing that Netflix's takeover of Warner Brothers Discovery would give one firm too much power over actors and other players in the industry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a horrible deal for Hollywood,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also said he thought Warner Bros' plan to spin-off its traditional networks into an independent company would set them up to fail and ultimately prove a mistake for shareholders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think [its shares are] going to be worth a lot less than people are claiming,\" he said. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Netflix executives, who spoke at a business conference on Monday, said they were confident their takeover could win approval, noting that their plan does not include plans for major cuts.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in Warner Bros rose more than 4% on Monday while Paramount shares jumped 9%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shares in Netflix, however, dropped more than 3%.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

an issue which Trump has at times characterised as a \"hoax\" and a \"con job\" perpetrated by Democrats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also followed complaints from US farmers after they lost access to customers in China as a result of Trump's trade policies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, China is the world's biggest market for soybeans and has in recent decades been a major buyer from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Beijing effectively shut the door on American soybean imports for months after Trump hit Chinese goods with new levies earlier this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on Monday, Trump threatened to impose a new 5% tariff on Mexico, accusing it of violating an agreement that gives American farmers access to water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is very unfair to our US Farmers who deserve this much needed water,\" he posted on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was referring to a more than 80-year-old treaty that grants the US water from Rio Grande tributaries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For decades the US has accused Mexico of not meeting the terms of the agreement.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2a5b/live/f3970ef0-d454-11f0-9aed-598bbb04d197.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Soybean farmer in Illinois in October 2025, getting onto a large agricultural threshing vehicle. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">China is the largest export destination for US soybeans. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark Legan, a livestock, corn and soybean farmer in Putnam County, Indiana, told the BBC that the government aid would \"help our bottom line\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As crop prices have fallen and profitability has plummeted, he could use the funds to help replace tractors and other machinery - investments he has put on hold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his first administration, Trump also provided aid packages to farmers, including $22bn in 2019 and another $46bn in a 2020 package that also included relief from the Covid pandemic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Legan said he believed the new package would be similar to what he received during the first Trump term, in that it would not resolve persistent cost pressures and shrinking export markets, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The problem is still that we have high costs of production,\" Mr Legan said, pointing to record high prices for crop protection chemicals and seeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While some markets have opened up, we're still not back to exporting as much ag products as we have in the past,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Illinois farmer, Brad Smith, heard news of the $12bn package while at the Illinois Farm Bureau State Convention in Chicago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"None of us really love it, but we're not in a position where we can be turning it down,\" he said. \"We hope we can reduce the need for anything like this going forward.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If he does receive funds from the government, the money will likely be in his hands for three days, he said, before spending it to clear outstanding bills and hopefully buy seeds, chemicals and fertilisers for next year's crop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Smith said that distributing government aid to farmers who need it the most, rather than to larger farms, has been a challenge in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following an October meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea, the White House said China had committed to buying at least 12 million metric tonnes of US soybeans by the end of 2025, followed by 25 million metric tonnes annually for the next three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, China has only purchased approximately one-quarter of that amount. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those purchases, however, have accelerated, and Bessent told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that China is likely to meet the goal by the end of February. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why a farm aid package was necessary, Bessent said \"the Chinese actually used our soybean farmers as pawns in the trade negotiations\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are going to create this bridge because... agriculture is all about the future,\" he said. \"You've got to start financing for planning next year when things will be very good.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, he signed an executive order creating food supply chain security \"task forces\" and assessing \"anti-competitive behaviour\" in the agricultural sector.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-peter-hoskins\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Peter Hoskins</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

US immigration officials could not \"confirm or deny a flight\" for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first deportation flight took off from the US in late September, in a rare instance of cooperation between Iran and the US. Many Iranian nationals say they come to the US because they fear persecution at home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Father Joseph Bach, a member of Borderland Companions of Hope, a Franciscan organisation that provides support to migrants, said he has been informed through his contacts inside an Arizona detention facility that Christian converts were among those removed. He also said some detainees had identified as LGBT.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christian converts and members of the LGBT community are groups that face severe legal and social repercussions in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Father Joseph called the deportations \"the most unchristian thing to do\", adding, \"It's scary, it concerns me, it is not OK. I call this a death flight.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities have facilitated the repatriation efforts. An Iranian consular official said the deported nationals had \"announced their willingness for return following continuation of anti-immigration and discriminative policy against foreign nationals, particularly Iranians, by the United States\", the Iran's judiciary-affiliated Mizan News Agency reports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one detainee who spoke with the BBC said not all those who were deported were willing to return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person who was on a list for potential deportation told the BBC he and his partner crossed into the US on foot from Mexico earlier this year. Speaking from an immigration detention centre in Arizona, he said he feared for his life if he returned to Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest deportations come as already severely strained relations between the two countries further deteriorated in June, after the US bombed Iran's nuclear facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The removals highlight the US government's hardline immigration posture under President Donald Trump, who made border security and reducing unauthorised migration central to his political agenda.</p></div></div></body></html>"

to protect the public from deceptive business practices and unfair competition - Congress passed a law saying a president could only remove commissioners for cause and that the five-member commission can have no more than three members of the same political party. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump appointed Ms Slaughter in 2018 to fill a Democratic position on the FTC, and she was later reappointed by former President Joe Biden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar firing rules exist for other independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law was put to the test in 1935, when President Franklin Roosevelt tried to remove a member of the FTC, leading the Supreme Court to uphold the independence of certain federal agencies like the trade commission.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 90-year-old ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, the court found that, while the president has the ability to remove executive officers without cause, such a power does not apply to agencies like the FTC that are \"neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During oral arguments on Monday, the four conservative justices on the court appeared to disagree with Ms Slaughter's lawyers' arguments that this would be an unacceptable expansion of Trump's powers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arguing for the Trump administration, US Solicitor General John Sauer called the Humphrey's rule an \"indefensible outlier\" and \"decaying husk\" of a Supreme Court decision that should be overturned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think broad delegations to unaccountable independent agencies raise enormous constitutional and real-world problems for individual liberty,\" said conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The three liberal justices pressed why the court would overturn a 90-year-old precedent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're asking us to destroy the structure of government,\" said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, \"and to take away from Congress its ability to protect its idea that the government is better structured with some agencies that are independent.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Justice Elena Kagan suggested that allowing Trump to remove Ms Slaughter could have wide-reaching impacts, asking: \"The question is, where does this lead?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Employees are wielding executive power all over the place, and yet we've had civil service laws that give them substantial protection from removal for over a century,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyer Amit Agarwal, representing Ms Slaughter, said independent auditing groups like the FTC  have a long history in US politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Multi-member commissions with members enjoying some kind of removal protection have been part of our story since 1790. So if petitioners are right, all three branches of government have been wrong from the start,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court has already issued one ruling against Ms Slaughter, which analysts suggested could indicate how it would ultimately rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A lower court ruled that Ms Slaughter had been illegally removed from the FTC, leading the Trump administration to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a 6-3 decision, the conservative-majority court in September issued an emergency order maintaining her firing until the case could be heard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Supreme Court is also set to take up at a later date a separate case on whether Trump had the power to remove Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

eZyhnA\">They arrived in the Niger state capital, Minna, in a fleet of minibuses escorted by military vans and armoured vehicles, and were received by Governor Umar Bago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Details about their release remain unclear, including whether it was secured through negotiation or by force, and whether any ransoms were paid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, more than 250 students and 12 staff were kidnapped from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri, the latest in a wave of mass abductions.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has learned that the rescued students will be transported to the school, located more than 300km (186 miles) from the state capital, on Tuesday where they will be reunited with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role in securing their release, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu visited Papiri and met a delegation led by Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, assuring them the children would soon be rescued and reunited with their families.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 153 students and 12 staff members are still with the unknown gunmen.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schools and places of worship have increasingly been targeted in the latest wave of attacks in north and central Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on St Mary's, on 21 November, was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier: on 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week gunmen abducted at least 20 people in two separate attacks - at a newly established church in central Kogi state, where a pastor, his wife and some worshipers were taken, and in the mostly Muslim northern Sokoto state, where a bride and her bridesmaids were among those kidnapped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments. However, a presidential spokesman <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgj9dd983xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">earlier told the BBC that the government believes they are the work of jihadist groups.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paying of ransoms has been made illegal in Nigeria in an attempt to cut the supply of funds to the kidnap gangs but it is widely believed that in many cases money is still handed over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's security crisis attracted the international spotlight last month after US President Donald Trump threatened to send over troops if the government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigerian officials and analysts say that members of all faiths are victims of the violence and kidnappings and say it is not true that Christians are being targeted.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

He had been imprisoned for a year, in solitary confinement,\" Alfredo Romero, the organisation's president, wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that Díaz had only been allowed one visit from his daughter during the entire length of his incarceration. He added that 17 political prisoners have died in the country since 2014.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition groups have also criticised the government over the death of Diaz. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">María Corina Machado, a prominent opposition leader who won this year's Nobel Peace Prize but who remains in hiding to avoid arrest, said Díaz's death was not an isolated incident. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Sadly, it adds to an alarming and painful chain of deaths of political prisoners detained in the context of the post-election repression,\" she wrote on X. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado, a vocal critic of Maduro's government who was integral to galvanising the opposition against him, will likely be absent from the Nobel Prize-giving ceremony in Oslo on Wednesday. Venezuela's attorney general <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c33mnvy5zppo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">said last month that she would be considered a \"fugitive\" if she travelled to Norway</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Democratic Unitary Platform, an opposition alliance, said Díaz \"died unjustly\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diaz's own political party, Democratic Action (AD), also paid tribute to the former governor, saying he had been unjustly detained without due process and had remained in conditions \"that should never have violated his fundamental rights\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions between the US and Venezuela have become increasingly strained over what Trump has described as efforts to stem the flow of drugs and migrants into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US air strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and Pacific have killed more than 80 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" into the US, and designated two Venezuelan drug cartels - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as terrorist organisations, the latter of which Trump alleged Maduro led.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has in turn accused the US of using its war on drugs as an excuse to depose his socialist government and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves. Colombia's left-wing President Gustavo Petro has said the US strikes were an attempt to \"dominate\" Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also stationed a large naval force - its largest deployment in the region in decades - along with thousands of troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan army reportedly swore in more than 5,600 soldiers in one go on Saturday, in response to what military leaders called US \"threats\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, the Venezuelan government said that Maduro and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had agreed to resume Turkish Airlines flights between the two nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The carrier was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd0keyern0do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">one of six major international airlines to have their landing licences revoked</a> after temporarily suspending flights to Caracas over a US warning of \"heightened military activity\" in the area.</p></div></div></body></html>"

welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy, calling it \"largely consistent\" with Moscow's vision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 33-page document, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c04vdengk3do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">unveiled by the US administration this week</a>, suggests Europe is facing \"civilisational erasure\" and does not cast Russia as a threat to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration, and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of \"censorship\" are mentioned as other priorities in the report. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The adjustments we're seeing... are largely consistent with our vision,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in an interview published by Russia's state news agency Tass on Sunday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We consider this a positive step,\" he said, adding that Moscow would continue to analyse the document before drawing strong conclusions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strategy adopts a softer language towards Russia, which EU officials worry could weaken its stance towards Moscow as it pushes for an end to the war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the document, the EU is blamed for blocking US efforts to end the conflict and says that the US must \"re-establish strategic stability to Russia\" which would \"stabilise European economies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It appears to endorse efforts to influence policy on the continent, noting that US policy should prioritise \"resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new report also calls for the restoration of \"Western identity\", and claims that Europe will be \"unrecognisable in 20 years or less\" and its economic issues are \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies,\" the document states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In stark contrast, the document celebrates the influence of \"patriotic European parties\" and says \"America encourages its political allies in Europe to promote this revival of spirit\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the EU engages in ongoing talks with the Trump administration to set out a peace deal in Ukraine, some officials emphasised their lasting relationship with the US, while raising \"questions\" over the document. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US will remain our most important ally in the [Nato] alliance. This alliance, however, is focused on addressing security policy issues,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Friday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe questions of freedom of expression or the organisation of our free societies do not belong [in the strategy], in any case at least when it comes to Germany.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a social media post addressed to his \"American friends\", Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that \"Europe is your closest ally, not your problem\" and noted their \"common enemies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the only reasonable strategy of our common security. Unless something has changed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document \"places itself to the right of the extreme right\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has fostered links with the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy6zk9wkrdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">far-right AfD party in Germany</a>, which has been classified as extreme right by German intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Promoting an \"America First\" message, the strategy says the US intends to target alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean, considering possible military action in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US also calls on an increased defence spending from Japan, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats in Congress warned that the document could shatter US foreign relations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Representative Jason Crow of Colorado, who sits on House committees overseeing intelligence and the armed forces, called the strategy \"catastrophic to America's standing in the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New York Representative Gregory Meeks said it \"discards decades of value-based, US leadership\".</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

The death toll, which currently stands at 159, is likely to rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Hong Kong mourns its dead, some are asking whether the fire could have been prevented and questioning building safety standards. Many Hongkongers live in ageing high-rise buildings similar to Wang Fuk Court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have since ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of the fire, and have arrested 13 people on suspicion of manslaughter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have also ordered the removal of scaffolding mesh used in all building renovations across the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators have found that a scaffolding mesh used for renovations in Wang Fuk Court failed to meet flame retardant standards - and that the fire spread quickly due to the mesh and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities have also moved quickly to quell dissent.

The question asks applicants to identify Trump policy initiatives that are significant to them, and to describe how they personally would advance Trump's agenda. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has long that said loyalty is the most important thing to him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I value loyalty above everything else - more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy,\" he <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=qJ_ZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=I+value+loyalty+above+everything+else%E2%80%94more+than+brains,+more+than+drive,+and+more+than+energy&amp;dq=I+value+loyalty+above+everything+else%E2%80%94more+than+brains,+more+than+drive,+and+more+tha\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">once said</a>.  </p></div></div></body></html>"

It would let users build their own public squares without the traditional gatekeepers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was that heady optimism phase when I first joined and I think a lot of the world shared that,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time he left the firm in 2017, seeds of doubt about its work had been planted, and they've since bloomed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's lots of good things about these platforms, but there's just too much bad stuff,\" he surmises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's no longer an uncommon view as scrutiny of the largest social media companies has increased around the globe. A lot of it has centred on teenagers, who have emerged as a lucrative market for incredibly wealthy global firms - at the expense of their mental health and wellbeing, according to critics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Various governments, from the state of Utah to the European Union, have been experimenting with limiting children's use of social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the most radical step so far is set to unfold in Australia - a ban for under-16s that kicks in on 10 December has left tech companies scrambling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of the social media firms affected have spent a year loudly protesting against the new law, which requires them to take \"reasonable steps\" to keep underage users from having accounts on their platforms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have claimed this ban actually risks making children less safe, argued it impinges on their rights, and repeatedly pointed to the questions around the tech that will be used to enforce the policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Australia is engaged in blanket censorship that will make its youth less informed, less connected, and less equipped to navigate the spaces they will be expected to understand as adults,\" said Paul Taske from NetChoice, a trade group representing several big tech companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The worry inside the industry is that Australia's ban - the first of its kind - may inspire other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It could become a proof of concept that gains traction around the world,\" says Nate Fast, a professor at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Whistleblowers, lawsuits and questions</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87b3/live/a25994f0-d499-11f0-aa93-919fae4fc008.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images (L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on January 31, 2024 in Washington, DC. \n\nThey are all in black suits and seated in a row at a table. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">(L-R) Jason Citron, CEO of Discord, Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, Shou Zi Chew, CEO of TikTok, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta at a Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing in January</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent years, multiple whistleblowers and lawsuits have claimed that social media firms are prioritising profits over user safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In January, a landmark trial will begin in the US hearing allegations that several – including Meta, TikTok, Snapchat and YouTube – have designed their apps to be addictive and knowingly covered up the harm their platforms cause. All deny this, but Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and Snap boss Evan Spiegel have <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly2875013eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">both been ordered to testify in person</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case consolidates hundreds of claims from parents and school districts, and is among the first to advance from a flood of similar lawsuits which allege social media contributes to poor mental health and child exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another ongoing case, state prosecutors alleged that Zuckerberg personally scuttled efforts to improve the wellbeing of teens on the company's platforms, including vetoing a proposal to ditch Instagram face-altering beauty filters which experts say fuel body dysmorphia and eating disorders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Meta employees Sarah Wynn-Williams, Frances Haugen and Arturo Béjar have given testimony before the US Congress alleging a range of wrongdoing they observed during their stints at the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meta maintains the company has worked diligently to create tools that keep teens safe online.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the broader industry has also recently been taken to task over mis- and disinformation, hate speech and violent content. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Graphic footage of the assassination of Charlie Kirk was rapidly spread on various platforms, even confronting people who were not seeking it out. Elon Musk has sued states in the US over laws that require social media firms, including X, to define and disclose how they fight hate speech online. And Meta was heavily criticised earlier this year after <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">announcing it was getting rid of factcheckers</a> who monitor its platforms for misinformation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A rare bipartisan front has emerged among American lawmakers eager to cut tech bosses down to size.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During a hearing last year, Zuckerberg was prodded by one to apologise to bereaved families who had come to watch in person. Among those in the audience was Tammy Rodriguez, whose 11-year old daughter Selena took her life after facing sexual exploitation on Instagram and Snapchat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is why we invest so much and we are going to continue doing industry wide efforts to make sure no one has to go through the things your families have had to suffer,\" Zuckerberg said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Public scrutiny and private lobbying</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there's widespread criticism from many experts, lawmakers and parents - even kids - who feel social media companies are hiding from genuine action and accountability on these issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Australia's social media ban was considered, then formulated, the firms had little to say publicly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hiding from the public discourse… it just breeds more suspicion and more distrust,\" Mr Scheeler says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Privately though, many were seeking to bend the government's ear. Spiegel personally sat down with Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells. She also claimed YouTube had sent globally renowned children's entertainers The Wiggles to lobby on their behalf.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In carefully worded public statements, several of the firms have tried to push responsibility elsewhere. Meta and Snap both said operators of the major app stores – namely Apple and Google – should take on age verification duties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And many argued government is overstepping. Parents know best, they say, and they should decide what makes sense for their teens when it comes to social media use. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"While we're committed to meeting our legal obligations, we've consistently raised concerns about this law… There's a better way: legislation that empowers parents to approve app downloads and verify age allows families - not the government - to decide which apps teens can access,\" a statement from Meta provided to the BBC said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Annika Wells says big tech won't intimidate her over Australian social media ban</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why her government was unsympathetic to this reasoning - why anything short of a ban was unacceptable - Wells said the tech companies have had plenty of time to improve their practices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They have had 15, 20 years in this space to do that of their own volition now, and… it's not enough.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leaders in other countries feel the same, and have been knocking on her door for help, she says, rattling off the EU, Fiji, Greece, even Malta, as examples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark and Norway have already begun work on similar laws, and Singapore and Brazil are watching closely too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're pleased to be the first, we're proud to be the first, and we stand ready to help any other jurisdiction who seeks to do these things,\" Wells said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Too little, too late?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the Australia ban loomed, the mounting pressure prompted the companies to introduce versions of their products marketed as safer for young users, said Pinar Yildirim, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia, after all, is a major market for social platforms. At parliamentary hearings in October Snapchat said it believed it had about 440,000 account users in the country aged between 13 and 15. TikTok said it had about 200,000 under-16 accounts and Meta said it had about 450,000 between Facebook and Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say they are also eager to ensure they don't lose others in even larger markets around the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2776/live/284ce400-d408-11f0-be97-4b9f7a1a7a49.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Getty Images Former Meta engineer Arturo Béjar speaks during a rally from a lectern with a blue sign reading \"protect kids online\".

The phenomenon picked up just before the pandemic in 2020, when north-eastern <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.epw.in/journal/2022/26-27/commentary/revaluing-unpaid-work.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Assam </a>rolled out a scheme for vulnerable women. Since then these transfers have turned into a political juggernaut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The recent wave of unconditional cash transfers targets adult women, with some states acknowledging their unpaid domestic and care work. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZqvIm1YsEnQNjO8KfzMoNwjH7m9jRfJ/view\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tamil Nadu</a> frames its payments as a \"rights grant\" while <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.myscheme.gov.in/schemes/lbs-wb\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">West Bengal's</a> scheme similarly recognises women's unpaid contributions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other states, the recognition is implicit: policymakers expect women to use the transfers for household and family welfare, say experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This focus on women's economic role has also shaped politics: in 2021, Tamil actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan promised \"salaries for housewives\". (His fledgling party lost.) By 2024, pledges of women-focused cash transfers helped deliver victories to political parties in Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Odisha, Haryana and Andhra Pradesh. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the recent elections in Bihar, the political power of cash transfers was on stark display. In the weeks before polling in the country's poorest state, the government transferred 10,000 rupees ($112; £85) to 7.5 million female bank accounts under a livelihood-generation scheme. Women voted in larger numbers than men, decisively shaping the outcome. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics called it blatant vote-buying, but the result was clear: women helped the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition secure a landslide victory. Many believe this cash infusion was a reminder of how financial support can be used as political leverage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Bihar is only one piece of a much larger picture. Across India, unconditional cash transfers are reaching tens of millions of women on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maharashtra alone promises benefits for 25 million women; Odisha's scheme reaches 71% of its female voters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some policy circles, the schemes are derided as vote-buying freebies. They also put pressure on state finances: 12 states are set to spend around $18bn on such payouts this fiscal year.  A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://prsindia.org/files/budget/budget_state_finance_report/2025/SOSF-2025.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report</a> by  think-tank PRS Legislative Research notes that half of these states face revenue deficits - this happens when a state borrows to pay regular expenses without creating assets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many argue they also reflect a slow recognition of something India's feminists have argued for decades: the economic value of unpaid domestic and care work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women in India spent nearly five hours a day on such work in 2024 - more than three times the time spent by men, according to the latest Time Use Survey.

Most used it for food, education and medical costs; hardly transformative, but the regularity offered security and a sense of agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More detailed work by Prof Kotiswaran and colleagues shows mixed outcomes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Assam, most women spent the money on essentials; many appreciated the dignity it afforded, but few linked it to recognition of unpaid work, and most would still prefer paid jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tamil Nadu, women getting the money spoke of peace of mind, reduced marital conflict and newfound confidence - a rare social dividend. In Karnataka, beneficiaries reported eating better, gaining more say in household decisions and wanting higher payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet only a sliver understood the scheme as compensation for unpaid care work; messaging had not travelled. Even so, women said the money allowed them to question politicians and manage emergencies. Across studies, the majority of women had full control of the cash.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The evidence shows that the cash transfers are tremendously useful for women to meet their own immediate needs and those of their households. They also restore dignity to women who are otherwise financially dependent on their husbands for every minor expense,\" Prof Kotiswaran says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Importantly, none of the surveys finds evidence that the money discourages women from seeking paid work or entrench gender roles - the two big feminist fears, according to a report by Prof Kotiswaran along with Gale Andrew and Madhusree Jana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nor have they reduced women's unpaid workload, the researchers find. They do, however, strengthen financial autonomy and modestly strengthen bargaining power. They are neither panacea nor poison: they are useful but limited tools, operating in a patriarchal society where cash alone cannot undo structural inequities.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/052b/live/8992c560-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Swastik Pal Women at a cash transfer camp in West Bengal\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Swastik Pal</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Women welcome the dignity the cash transfers provide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What next? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emerging research offers clear hints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eligibility rules should be simplified, especially for women doing heavy unpaid care work.

And cash transfers cannot substitute for employment opportunities; many women say what they really want is work that pays and respect that endures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the transfers are coupled with messaging on the recognition of women's unpaid work, they could potentially disrupt the gendered division of labour when paid employment opportunities become available,\" says Prof Kotiswaran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's quiet cash transfers revolution is still in its early chapters. But it already shows that small, regular sums - paid directly to women - can shift power in subtle, significant ways. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether this becomes a path to empowerment or merely a new form of political patronage will depend on what India chooses to build around the money.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It was a message that many Syrians and foreign governments wanted to hear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel dismissed it, however.

It was the continuation of a long campaign that had started years earlier as Sharaa built up his power in Idlib.

Syria Weekly, which collects data on violence, calculates that there were more than twice as many as the monthly average for the rest of the year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We visited the border village of Beit Jinn, which was raided by IDF troops on 28 November.

The Israelis killed at least 13 local people and wounded dozens, state media reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a sign of how hard it will be to broker a security deal between Syria and Israel.

Cameras positioned at the entrance track his every move, while reams of barbed wire surround the farm in the rural Free State province in the heart of South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It feels like a prison,\" he says as the gates clank shut behind him. \"If they want to come and kill us they can. At least it will take them time to get to me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fear of being attacked is very real for the white Afrikaner, who manages a farm with his wife and two young daughters. He did not want us to use his full name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His grandfather and his wife's grandfather were both murdered in farm attacks, and he lives a two-hour drive from where the body of 21-year-old farm manager Brendan Horner was discovered five years ago, tied to a pole, with a rope around his neck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marthinus says he can't take a chance with his own family and, in February, they applied for refugee status in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm prepared to do that to get a better life for my wife and children.

Nobody deserves a life like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Violent crime in South Africa is endemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest crime figures released in November for the first quarter of 2025 show there was an average of 63 murders every day. While this was a decrease on the same period in 2024, South Africa's homicide rate remains one of the highest in the world. </p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Thabo Makopo is also worried about being targeted by criminals</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Black farmers are also victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the outskirts of Ficksburg, a town at the foot of Free State's Imperani Mountain, Thabo Makopo has a small farm of 237 acres (96 hectares), where he tends sheep and cattle. Like Marthinus, the 45-year-old says farm attacks are his biggest problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are young men. They are armed and dangerous. Whether they will lose their life or take yours, they are going to take those livestock,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thabo believes all farmers in the province, regardless of their race, are at risk of attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's all of us. I could be attacked today - it could happen to any of us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police response rates to reports of crime are notoriously low, something the police here acknowledge but have said publicly that they are working on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, South Africans are becoming increasingly dependent on private security. According to the official regulatory body for the private security sector in South Africa, there are more than 630,000 active security guards. That is more than the police and army combined.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Morgan Barrett rejects the idea that there is a white genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many farmers, like Morgan Barrett, who is white, employ their own security guards, if they can afford it. He owns a 2,000-acre farm which has been in his family for six generations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wrapped up in a thick jacket and hat, he climbs into his car to begin a night patrol. Between Morgan and his neighbours, they are out almost every night. Six of his cattle were stolen the previous week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You can call the police, and they may turn up two or three hours later, by which time the thieves will have run away,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Thabo, he doesn't believe he is targeted because of the colour of his skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand ($1,200; £880) sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked about what he thinks of people claiming there is a \"white genocide\" in South Africa, he says he thinks they \"have no real understanding of what a genocide is\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What happened in Rwanda is genocide.

Sixteen of the victims were black, while two were white.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these statistics, the theory that white people are being persecuted for their race, once an idea confined to far-right groups in South Africa, continues to be propelled into the mainstream.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Systematic racial persecution is something black people in South Africa, who make up more than 80% of the population, faced for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the apartheid system that lasted for 46 years from 1948, the white-minority government legally separated people based on the colour of their skin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It built on already existing discriminatory legislation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The right to vote, buy land and work in skilled jobs was reserved for white people. Millions of black South Africans were removed from their land and forced to live in segregated neighbourhoods where education in schools was restricted to maintain racial hierarchy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regime was enforced through violence and repression.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though apartheid ended in 1994, the profound racial inequalities continue to exist more than 30 years later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post-apartheid government did introduce affirmative action policies to try and redress some of the issues, but these have been criticised by some for not being effective and introducing \"race quotas\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nevertheless, 72% of private farmland is still in white hands, according to the government's 2017 Land Audit report. That's despite white people making up just 7.3% of the population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A land reform programme - based on the principle of willing-seller willing-buyer - has hardly moved the dial. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cn05gnyzgd6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">A new law this year</a> does give the state the power to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation for owners, but this is only in rare circumstances, according to legal experts who spoke to the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And while white farmers own more private land than any other group in the country, victims of farm attacks span across all races. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political spotlight is on white farmers, yet crime and violence on the ground is indiscriminate.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nthabiseng Nthathakana's husband died when criminals attacked their small shop</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Meqheleng, a township on the outskirts of Ficksburg where black South Africans were forcibly relocated during the apartheid regime, Nthabiseng Nthathakana owns a small general store.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 January this year, there was a robbery while her husband, Thembani Ncgango, was closing up.

The scientists at Waseda University hope that in the future, AIREC will be able to change adult nappies and prevent bedsores in patients.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Toshio Morita (R) works at the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Similar robots are already being used in care homes to play music to residents or guide them in simple stretching exercises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are also monitoring patients at night - placed under mattresses to track sleep and conditions - and cutting back on the need for humans doing the rounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although humanoid robots are being developed for the near future, Assistant Professor Tamon Miyake says the level of precision and intelligence required will take at last five years before they are safely able to interact with humans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It requires full-body sensing and adaptive understanding - how to adjust for each person and situation,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Emotional support is also part of the innovation drive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Poketomo, a 12cm tall robot, can be carried around in a bag or can fit into a pocket. It reminds users to take medication, tells you how to prepare in real time for the weather outside and offers conversation for those living alone, which its creators say helps to ease social isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're focusing on social issues... and to use new technology to help solve those problems,\" Miho Kagei, development manager from Sharp told the BBC.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While devices and robots offer new ways to assist, human connection remains irreplaceable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Robots should supplement, not substitute, human caregivers,\" Mr Miyake, the Waseda University scientist said. \"While they may take over some tasks, their main role is to assist both caregivers and patients.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders in Sengawa, Tokyo, founded by Akiko Kanna, people stream in to be served by patients suffering from dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inspired by her father's experience with the condition, Ms Kanna wanted a place where people could remain engaged and feel purposeful.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Toshio Morita, one of the café's servers, uses flowers to remember which table ordered what.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his cognitive decline, Mr Morita enjoys the interaction. For his wife, the café provides respite and helps keep him engaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kanna's café illustrates why social interventions and community support remain essential. Technology can provide tools and relief, but meaningful engagement and human connection are what truly sustain people living with dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly? I wanted a little pocket money. I like meeting all sorts of people,\" Mr Morita says. \"Everyone's different - that's what makes it fun.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/729d/live/1bd57a40-d18b-11f0-abf3-97535f35adb4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Lineup of Sharp Poketomo robots at Ceatec in Chiba, Japan\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sharp's Poketomo robot has been designed to give companionship to patients</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-jaltson-akkanath-chummar\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Jaltson Akkanath Chummar</i></p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

This is the light of hope for us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals – both Christians and Muslims - pose for selfies in front of the tree hung with red and gold baubles in Manger Square. They are joined by a handful of foreign tourists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Brightly coloured lights now decorate the streets and there are signs advertising Christmas bazaars and children's parties.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mayor Maher Canawati was keen to resume Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit,\" says local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about. And this year, if Christmas is peaceful, then I hope it will bring a nice message for the whole world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light Christmas trees in the coming days. Hotels – which have stood largely empty for the past two years – have an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel as well as some foreign visitors.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nadya Hazboun is very happy that the tree is back and tourists are returning to Bethlehem</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One tourist from Russia, Angelica, is on her second pilgrimage to the Holy Land.  \"I think everyone needs to come at least once in their life,\" she tells me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope a lot of people will soon come back because it's sad without many tourists.  The only thing that's good is that you don't have long lines – you can come and see more things. When I came before you had to wait in line for a few hours minimum.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the souvenir stores dotted around Bethlehem have little business, and outside the cream-coloured walls of the Nativity Church, which date back to the Fourth Century, tour guides largely stand idle. Prior to the Gaza war, it was often crammed with people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One guide, Hamza, is worried that ongoing news coverage makes people feel the situation is still dangerous. He insists it is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a tourist city; without tourism there is no life,\" Hamza laments. \"We hope to have people coming back like before: from Europe, the Middle East, America, Latin America and everywhere. We start with the Christmas tree lighting, and we'll wait.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past two years, unemployment has skyrocketed in Bethlehem. Since the deadly Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October 2023 which triggered the war, tens of thousands of Palestinian labourers from the West Bank have been blocked from entering Israel and its settlements for work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, public servants have received only partial salaries by the Palestinian Authority (PA) – which governs parts of the West Bank. The PA relies on tax revenues collected by Israel which it is withholding – to the tune of $1.76 billion, according to the UN's trade and development agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel says it is holding the funds because the PA makes payments to Palestinian prisoners that incentivise attacks on Israelis.

He says that recently many families could not even afford falafel – a cheap, traditional snack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Christians will try to celebrate but according to their situation,\" Mr Salameh anticipates. \"Someone who wants to take his kids to a festival or the theatre or whatever, he doesn't have the money to spend for this celebration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the cave-like grotto at the base of the Nativity Church, a local woman follows a small Indian tour group, stooping down by a silver star which marks the spot where it is said that Jesus was born and lighting a candle nearby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With tensions still high across the region, people in Bethlehem say they are praying for peace – and hoping for tourists to come back to the place where it is believed Christmas began.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Thrown out of a violent and abusive foster home, she had little to stay for. But when she left Lagos in 2016, crossing the desert to Libya, she had little idea of her traumatic journey ahead, forced into sex work and years of asylum claims in country after country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The majority of irregular migrants and asylum seekers are men - 70% according to the European Agency for Asylum - but the number of women like Esther, who have come to Europe to seek asylum is on the rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are seeing an increase in women travelling alone, both on the Mediterranean and the Balkan routes,\" says Irini Contogiannis from the International Rescue Committee in Italy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its 2024 report highlighted a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route, while families grew by 52%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Migrant routes are notoriously treacherous. Last year 3,419 migrant deaths or disappearances in Europe were recorded by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) - the deadliest year on record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for women, there is the added threat of sexual violence and exploitation, which happened to Esther after she was betrayed by the woman who had promised her a better life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She locked me up in a room and brought in a man. He had sex with me, with force. I was still a virgin,\" Esther says. \"That's what they do… travel to different villages in Nigeria to pick young girls, and bring them to Libya to become sex slaves.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Their experiences are different and often riskier,\" Ugochi Daniels of the IOM told the BBC. \"Even women travelling in groups often lack consistent protection, exposing them to abuse by smugglers, traffickers, or other migrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women are aware of the risks but go anyway, packing condoms, or even getting contraceptive devices fitted in case they are raped on the way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All migrants have to pay a smuggler,\" says Hermine Gbedo of the anti-trafficking network Stella Polare. \"But women are often expected to offer sex as part of the payment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Gbedo supports women migrants in Trieste, a port city in north-east Italy which has long been a crossroads of cultures and serves as a major entry point to the European Union for those crossing from the Balkans. From here, they continue to countries like Germany, France, and the UK.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3005/live/b3170100-d06c-11f0-b6ef-e721b9e1ef03.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Barbara Zanon/Getty Image A man hands out takeaway food to a line of men in coats and hats, outside in a square in Trieste (February 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Barbara Zanon/Getty Image</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most migrants who arrive in Trieste via the Balkan route are male</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After four months of being exploited in Libya, Esther escaped and crossed the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy from which she was rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to the island of Lampedusa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She claimed asylum three times before she was granted refugee status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asylum seekers from countries viewed as safe are often rejected. At the time Italy viewed Nigeria as unsafe, but two years ago it changed that assessment as governments across Europe began tightening their rules in response to the big migrant influx into Europe of 2015-16. Voices calling for further restrictions on asylum claims have only grown louder since.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way,\" says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right wing government. \"We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to be hard-headed,\" warns Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange. \"We need to prioritise women and girls who are at immediate risk within conflict-affected territories, where rape is being used as a weapon of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Currently this is not happening consistently, he argues, and while he sympathises with the plight of women facing hazardous routes into Europe \"the key is controlled compassion\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, many women arriving from countries considered safe claim that the abuse they suffered on account of being a woman has meant that life in their home countries has become impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the case for Nina, a 28-year-old from Kosovo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People think everything is well in Kosovo, but that's not true,\" she says. \"Things are terrible for women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina says she and her sister were sexually abused by their boyfriends who forced them into sex work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2019 report by Europe's OSCE security organisation suggested that 54% of women in Kosovo had experienced psychological, physical or sexual violence from an intimate partner since the age of 15.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Women who face persecution on the grounds of gender-based violence are entitled to asylum under the Council of Europe's Istanbul Convention, and that was backed up by a landmark ruling by the EU's top court last year. The Convention details gender-based violence as psychological, physical and sexual - and includes female genital mutilation (FGM).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, its terms are not yet applied consistently, according to charity groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of asylum officials in the field are men who are insufficiently trained to deal with such a delicate issue [as female genital mutilation] - both medically and psychologically,\" says Marianne Nguena Kana, Director of End FGM European Network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many women have their asylum claims denied, she says, on the mistaken assumption that, because they have already undergone FGM, they face no further risk.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had judges saying: 'You've already been mutilated, so it's not dangerous for you to go back to your country, because it's not like they can do it to you again,\" Nguena Kana says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc23/live/155b3fe0-cf8f-11f0-aa60-9b31093c6070.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"International Rescue Committee 3 women sitting in a room, smiling.

Travelling with other women, they trekked through the forests of Eastern Europe trying to avoid the authorities. There, they said they were attacked by male migrants and smugglers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even though we were up in the mountains, in the dark, you could hear the screams,\" Nina recalls. \"The men would come up to us with a torch, shine it in our faces, pick who they wanted, and take them further into the forest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At night, I could hear my sister crying, begging for help.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nina and her sister told Italian authorities that if they returned home they would be killed by their ex-boyfriends. They were eventually granted asylum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Esther's fight for refugee status took much longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She first claimed asylum in Italy in 2016, but after a long wait there she moved to France and then Germany, where her asylum claims were rejected as according to the EU's Dublin regulation an asylum seeker is usually expected to apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was finally awarded refugee status in Italy in 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a decade on from leaving Nigeria, she wonders if her current existence in Italy was worth the pain she endured to get there: \"I don't even know the reason why I came to this place.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

He said: 'Let me give you the number of the agent who received us in Russia.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba messaged the number - the replies came in Russian at first.

None came.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The contact told her he was \"very far away\", and suggested that she travel to Russia herself, or send another relative, something she said the family could not afford to do.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the same contact told her she was \"entitled to compensation\" for her son's death but again, without providing any documentation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba says she has been unable to obtain official confirmation from the Russian authorities about David. When she visited the Russian embassy in Nairobi, officials there told her they did not \"associate with the army\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She has no idea what to do next and is beside herself with grief: \"How do we start? Because we don't know anything. He was my first-born. I depended on him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father of another Kenyan man who went to work in Russia told the BBC he was recruited on the understanding that he was going to be driver - nothing to do with armed combat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The young man ended up being wounded in Ukraine and has been too traumatised to speak since returning home two weeks ago. The BBC has agreed not to identify him to protect his wellbeing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His father only discovered that his son had travelled to Russia after receiving word that he had been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had hinted that people were going, and I discouraged him,\" the father told the BBC. \"I was following the war from the beginning. I was not comfortable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Agents had promised around $1,500 a month, he said - \"good money\" for a qualified driver in Kenya.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His son later told him that, like David Kuloba, he had been trained for only two weeks before being sent to the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said he was injured in the bush and for five days he could not find treatment. He was using painkillers,\" the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was eventually taken towards the border where he received first aid and was later transferred to St Petersburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had described seeing \"scattered bodies of other fighters\" and explained that many like him had signed one-year contracts without fully understanding the terms, the father said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cddrj3mzgz2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Kenya's foreign minister said some 200 Kenyans were known to be fighting for Russia</a> and acknowledged that recruitment networks were still active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This followed the news in September that a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c79vqpnqgy7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">young Kenyan athlete had been captured in Ukraine</a>, saying he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government now says several recruitment agencies are under investigation, and some licences have already been suspended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some agencies lure young people with promises of large payments. The government is tracking those agencies linked to this fraud,\" Sylvanus Osoro, Kenya's parliamentary majority chief whip, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of about 130 registered recruitment agencies in Kenya, around five had been flagged, with three already suspended and two others under investigation, he explained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament's Defence and Foreign Relations Committee had taken up the matter and the agencies it summoned were expected to outline how they had recruited young people, what information they had provided and how contracts were presented, Osoro said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But families with relatives unexpectedly fighting for Russian forces have criticised the government for its slow response, saying they feel helpless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressed on what was being done to repatriate those who were lured into combat roles, Osoro said the process must follow diplomatic channels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A contract is signed willingly, even if they were not aware,\" he said. \"It can only be handled diplomatically. Those engagements are happening.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that all known cases had \"been mapped\" and that officials were verifying the circumstances under which contracts had been signed. But he declined to confirm how many Kenyans might have died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't give such a report. That is not for me,\" he said. \"What I can say is that work is in progress.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Osoro said new legislation was being drafted to tighten controls on recruitment agencies, including stricter scrutiny before licences were issued and clearer distinctions between categories of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The issue extends beyond Kenya. The authorities in several African countries have reported cases of young people being approached with offers of lucrative jobs in Russia that later led to military recruitment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many families are reluctant to speak publicly, fearing stigma or uncertainty about the legal implications for their relatives abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In South Africa, it has become a major scandal after it was alleged that a daughter of former President Jacob Zuma was involved in the recruitment process. She denies any wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian officials have repeatedly warned that anyone fighting for Russia will be treated as an enemy combatant, and that the only safe route out is to surrender and be treated as a prisoner of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mrs Kuloba still has no official confirmation of her son's fate. She would like his body to be repatriated if he has died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just feel heartbroken,\" she said. \"He wanted to help us.

Judging your friend can lead to them behaving defensively, but finding the line between supporting and judging is a \"real challenge\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to be really careful to compartmentalise our own emotions and not project onto a friend, as they might not recognise they're in a toxic relationship,\" she tells the BBC. \"They might be carrying feelings of shame and masking it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She advises starting a conversation with a friend by telling them something like: \"I care about you so much but I want to check in because I've noticed that you seem really stressed lately.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Williamson adds it is important to \"stick to facts\" and only discuss things with them that you have observed. She recommends avoiding phrases such as \"I really don't like them\", \"I think they're toxic\" or \"I think they're abusive\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you still want to see your friend but don't want to be around their partner, Williamson says it can be handled delicately. \"I'd say something like, 'I really care about you, but I need to take some space from your partner because I'm not comfortable with their behaviour, but I really want to spend time with you.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also important to make sure you have support around you, as looking out for someone else all the time can be draining, she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yasmin Shaheen-Zaffar, a relationship and trauma counsellor, says that from watching Selling Sunset, some of the tension comes from cast members talking behind each other's backs and then being confronted about it later on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Avoid gossiping and talking about your friend or about their partner to others who could whip up hysteria,\" Shaheen-Zaffar tells the BBC. She says it's important to \"keep yourself safe\" because anything you say \"could be taken out of context or used against you\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Try to remain civil'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What if you disagree with the views or values of a friend's partner?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Selling Sunset, Stause and Hernan argue over Davis's views on politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Davis was set to appear on the ninth season of Selling Sunset, but had his scenes cut after another storyline involving Hernan was deemed more relevant. It's not known whether any of the scenes featured disagreements between Davis and Stause, but Hernan has denied that Davis expressed \"political views\" in front of Stause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shaheen-Zaffar says that ultimately you \"have to respect individual people's decisions\" and \"try to remain civil\" if you still want that friend to be part of your life. \"I think we have developed a culture where if someone doesn't agree with what we think we don't like them,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not the advice she says she would give if someone is being openly \"bigoted\", but more if they just have views you don't agree with. \"It takes a lot of self-development and digging deep to understand and accept other people's views,\" she adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whether you can cope with a friend's partner's conflicting views depends on what \"aligns with your values\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sometimes, a partner's actions may be too much for you - and it can break friendships entirely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After what happened with Georgia's partner, Hannah came to the conclusion that she could not see her friend again if she chose to stay with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I told her 'I love you, the door is always open but I can't have him in my life' - he wasn't a good, healthy presence and I was very uncomfortable and frightened,\" Hannah adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says Georgia and her haven't spoken since and the friendship ending \"really hurt\". She and Georgia had \"been friends for a long time and had a lot of fun together\" - although she ultimately wouldn't have done anything differently in hindsight, she says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
