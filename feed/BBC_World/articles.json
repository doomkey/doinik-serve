In recent months American warships have been moving into the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of funnelling narcotics into the US. Venezuela - home to some of the world's largest proven oil reserves - has, in turn, accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources. Maduro vowed on Wednesday that Venezuela would never become an \"oil colony\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the White House press secretary told reporters on Thursday that the US was committed to both \"stopping the flow of illegal drugs\" into the country and enforcing sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would not be drawn on whether the US planned to seize more ships transporting Venezuelan oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not going to stand by and watch sanctioned vessels sail the seas with black market oil, the proceeds of which will fuel narco-terrorism of rogue and illegitimate regimes around the world,\" Leavitt said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She added that the US planned to seize the oil on board the Skipper, after the necessary legal process.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leavitt also said Trump would not be concerned \"at all\" to hear Russian President Vladimir Putin had called Maduro earlier in the day to offer Moscow's support \"in the face of growing external pressure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later said that imposing sanctions on three nephews of Maduro's wife, alongside a number of businesses and ships, would tackle the leader's \"dictatorial and brutal control\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X, he said the Trump administration was \"holding the regime and its circle of cronies and companies accountable for its continued crimes\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: US actions against Venezuelan tanker are 'criminal' and 'illegal', says Maduro</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, the White House released dramatic video footage of the raid that showed camouflaged soldiers dropping down on to the Skipper from a helicopter, and walking its deck, weapons drawn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government strongly denounced the seizure, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They have ushered in a new era,\" the Venezuelan president said in a speech on Thursday. \"The era of criminal naval piracy in the Caribbean.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello called the US \"murderers, thieves, pirates\" and added that this was how the country had \"started wars all over the world\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper vessel in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for Hezbollah and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had ramped up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the days before the raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It involved thousands of troops and USS Gerald Ford - the world's largest aircraft carrier - being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

One says she was raped, and two others, including Baobao, say they were sexually assaulted or harassed, all by instructors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Undercover filming has exposed how staff pose as authorities to forcibly transfer young people to their institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thirteen students say they were abducted, with parental consent, by employees pretending to be police or officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accounts - from interviews by the BBC World Service, statements gathered by activists, police reports and state media - relate to five schools. These are part of a network of at least 10 schools, all of which have been run by - or have close links to - a military veteran called Li Zheng.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Baobao says every single moment at the school was \"agonising\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The centres are part of a booming industry promising anxious parents that military-style discipline will resolve concerns over young people's disobedience, internet addiction, teenage dating and depression, as well as gender and sexual identity. Some parents even send over-18s, who are legally adults.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A series of abuse allegations have made headlines in China in recent years, in both Li Zheng schools and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a few cases, arrests have been made or institutions shut down, but schools can be quick to reopen with different names or in different locations because the sector has been difficult to regulate. The BBC understands that Mr Li was arrested earlier this year, but we have discovered his associates have recently opened a new school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies and individuals involved in the network could either not be reached or declined to comment. The Chinese embassy in the UK told the BBC all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Deeply offensive' body search</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says her mother took her to the Lizheng Quality Education School in Hunan province when she began skipping classes, triggering rows which made their already difficult relationship worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her mother left while she was being shown around the school, she says, and she then realised she was not allowed to leave: \"They said if I behaved well, I might be able to get out.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao initially tried to kick and punch the instructors, she says, but decided to comply when they tried to restrain her with her own shoelaces. Later, she was searched. She describes the way this was done as sexual assault. \"I found it deeply offensive… she touched all my sensitive areas.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says her mother paid about 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months at the institution, and she was not given any academic lessons. Few disciplinary schools offer these, and some that do charge extra for them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The school is still operating, now known as Quality Education for Teenagers, with around 300 students, aged eight to 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Undercover footage was filmed there earlier this year by a woman posing as a parent considering enrolling her fictional 15-year-old son. She said he was smoking, dating and driving her car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was shown locked gates on staircases, metal grilles along open-air corridors and CCTV monitoring dormitories where children rest, get changed and shower.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Filmed undercover, a staff member says Quality Education for Teenagers uses a \"white lie\" when it takes students to the school</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A staff member told her it would take at least six months to improve the teenager's behaviour, but under a \"three-year warranty\" she could send him back paying for just food and accommodation if he reverted to his old ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was told not to tell him about the new school. \"When we arrange pick-ups, we tell a white lie,\" the staff member said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She explained instructors impersonating officials from the \"internet regulator\" would say they needed him to help with an investigation, and take him to the centre. \"If this fails, several instructors will simply restrain him and carry him to the vehicle,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another former student, Zhang Enxu, now aged 20, says she had a similar experience when she was taken to a different school in the network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then 19, she had left home, frustrated with her parents' refusal to accept her transgender identity and her decision to live as a woman - she was registered male at birth. She says she had returned for a family visit to her grandmother's grave, when three men claiming to be police appeared, saying her details had been used in fraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They forcibly dragged me into the car. My parents stood by as I was taken away,\" she says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Enxu says she was beaten and raped at the disciplinary school she was taken to at the age of 19</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was taken to Shengbo Youth Psychological Growth Training School in Hunan where she says she was beaten, leaving her with hearing loss in one ear, and later raped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the undercover footage from the school Baobao attended, a staff member says there are no beatings: \"We change the behaviour of youngsters with military training and counselling.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Baobao and Enxu describe a very different experience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Corporal punishment is ever-present,\" says Baobao. \"If your dance routines or military boxing lack precision, or are poorly executed, you will be punished.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said the instructors would use a pipe, raising it overhead before \"bringing it down with force\" on her classmates. \"Where they hit you would turn black. You get severe bruising.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos obtained and verified by the BBC, that were filmed at another of Li Zheng's schools, show instructors raising a rod high and striking students' hands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu says the students were forced to do \"enormous\" amounts of physical training. She said instructions to carry out exercises like push-ups \"might start at a thousand repetitions\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also says she was attacked in her dormitory by an instructor on night duty: \"He grabbed me by the hair and dragged me to the floor, then he sexually assaulted me.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Enxu's parents were sent videos of her at the school taking part in drills and counselling sessions</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says she considered trying to kill herself, but realised she would be caught in the hours it would take her to die.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says one of her classmates did attempt to take her own life, but instead of taking her to hospital, the instructors tried to flush her stomach themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Baobao and Enxu describe counselling sessions where little understanding was shown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's sessions were videoed for her parents, who she says had paid 65,800 yuan ($9,300, £7,000) for six months. \"Be a happy, healthy, positive boy. All right?\" she is urged. \"You're a boy, do what boys do… just be happy.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao says that when she told the counsellor she wanted to end her life, the response was: \"If you were going to die, you wouldn't be sitting here in front of me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Is that something a caring person would say? Are they even human?\" she asks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both students wondered how their parents could have decided to subject them to the experience.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's mother wept as she told the BBC the family had been \"deceived\" by the school's promises: \"Not only did you swindle someone out of their money, but you also tore their family apart, causing a breakdown in their relationship.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Footage obtained by the BBC that was filmed at one of Li Zheng's schools shows an instructor hitting a student on the hand</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social pressure to have academically successful children plays a major role in parents' decisions - particularly among urban middle-class families - to send their children to disciplinary schools, says Dr Yichen Rao, an anthropologist at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has studied internet addiction centres for young people in China, and says lack of support in the school system, anxiety, and conflict within the family can combine to make parents \"feel that they have no other choices\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao's mother declined to comment. Her daughter says she can now \"understand both sides\": \"I think she was brainwashed by the slogans used to sell the school. She was desperate for me to become more obedient… to be the daughter she always wanted.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Baobao managed to leave after feigning an eye problem. Her mother simply said \"let's turn the page\", leaving her angry and confused, she recalls.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Viral letters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu's ordeal ended after a month. Her friends realised she was missing and contacted the police, who then located her and shared a video of her at the school. Her friend Wang Yuhang identified the school by asking in online groups about the green uniform she was wearing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Enxu discreetly documented her experience in letters that were smuggled out and posted online.

The education department which oversees the school could not be reached, despite multiple attempts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Regulating these disciplinary centres is difficult. Some are not registered as schools. The responsibility is split between local education, civil affairs and market regulation authorities, a Chinese lawyer familiar with lawsuits against such institutions, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Rao says that with no centralised regulation over the disciplinary schools, the responsibility tends to fall to local government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He describes it as a \"shadowy industry that the state just tolerates\", adding that the state may not wish to give it legitimacy by providing regulation or guidelines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he adds, there is a \"spectrum\" of schools, with some incorporating psychotherapy for students and training for parents, or disciplining staff who carry out corporal punishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in London said the government \"attaches great importance to the lawful operation of educational institutions and the protection of minors\".

(2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar.

So I was unsure until the last minute,\" said Im Na-hye, a senior in Hanyeong High School.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But English language professor Jung Chae-kwan says it is a misnomer to call the English test tough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The texts aren't necessarily impossible, but... maddeningly confusing. It's a pain because it makes the material useless for actual education, \" says Prof Jung, who previously worked at the institution that administers the Suneung, and now teaches at Incheon National University. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Teachers end up drilling test-taking hacks rather than teaching English.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You don't even really need to read the full text to get the points if you know the tricks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some pointed out that several passages used in the questions are excerpts from books that have been taken out of context, making them hard to comprehend.

Everything could fall apart for many reasons,\" Zelensky said on Thursday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia demands that Ukraine relinquish control of roughly 30% of the eastern Donetsk region it still holds - something Ukraine has refused to do, both on principle and because it fears it would allow Moscow a foothold for future invasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Zelensky, the US is now envisaging a solution that would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, and Russian forces committing to not advancing into the territory. This area would become a \"special economic zone\" or a \"demilitarised zone\", Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he noted that it would not be fair for the Ukrainians to withdraw unilaterally, and that Russia should also pull back by the same distance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?\" he asked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said these were \"very serious concerns\" and that Ukraine might not accept the proposal at all – although he opened the door to elections or a referendum to give the Ukrainian people a choice.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he acknowledged that the fighting would continue and may yet shape the future of the negotiations: \"Much depends on our military – what they can hold, where they can stop the enemy, what they can destroy. This affects the entire configuration.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was another highly contentious point, Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power plant – Europe's largest – sits on the front line and has been under Russian control since March 2022. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said a possible solution would be for the Russians to withdraw and Kyiv to share control of the plant with the Americans – although he acknowledged that the details of such an arrangement were still unclear, and it is doubtful that Moscow would agree.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump appears to have grown frustrated with the intricacies of the conflict, and Kyiv and its allies fear the Americans might eventually seek to impose a Russian-led solution on Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky told reporters that although the Americans wanted a \"quicker conclusion\" to the war, there were no deadlines for an agreement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine - which is targeted by widespread aerial attacks on a near-nightly basis - has been pushing for respite and would want an immediate ceasefire to be implemented ahead of a more laborious agreement being fleshed out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia stands to gain more from a ceasefire being delayed, as its troops continue to make small but incremental gains on the frontline and its attacks exhaust the Ukrainian population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After multiple rounds of talks with Russia\" the Americans were now aligned on Moscow on this position, Zelensky said. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kremlin officials have been more tight-lipped than their European, US and Ukrainian counterparts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, whenever possible, Russia has sought to cement the impression that Moscow and Washington are aligned on their hopes for the terms of a peace deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov praised Trump for trying to broker a deal and said a recent meeting between President Vladimir Putin and US envoy Steve Witkoff at the Kremlin had \"eliminated\" the \"misunderstandings\" between the two sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The foreign minister also batted off suggestions that Kyiv could be given security guarantees in the form of foreign troops stationed in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is yet another return to the sad logic of Zelensky's so-called peace formula,\" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow had handed the US \"additional\" proposals on collective security and that Russia was ready to give legal guarantees not to attack Nato or EU countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But neither Ukraine nor Europe will be likely to take any promise by Moscow at face value, given Russia has previously violated ceasefires and truce deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European and Ukrainian officials want the US to be involved in giving security guarantees so that Kyiv doesn't become the target of renewed attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said he had received a draft proposal on American security guarantees but that the draft was a work in progress, suggesting that what has been offered by the US falls short of provisions that could assuage Kyiv's fears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The US does not want Ukraine in Nato. They say this openly... So I do not think they have difficulties discussing Nato with the Russians,\" Zelensky said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky also said Ukraine had to be \"cautious\", adding: \"We do not know what other agreements the US may have with Russia. We will learn in time.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's president also acknowledged that US support for Kyiv may one day end, both in terms of the flow of weapons that the US is selling through other countries and in terms of intelligence sharing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reflecting the fraught nature of the talks and his scepticism that Russia was negotiating in good faith, Zelensky told reporters: \"No one knows what may happen the day after tomorrow... We do not know how these negotiations will end.\"</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

The junta has made significant gains through a campaign of airstrikes and heavy bombardment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this year, more than 20 people were killed after an army motorised paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd protesting at a religious festival.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Civil liberties have also shrunk dramatically under the junta. Tens of thousands of political dissidents have been arrested, rights groups estimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Myanmar's junta has called for a general election on 28 December, touting it as a pathway to political stability. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But critics say the election will be neither free nor fair, but will instead offer the junta a guise of legitimacy. Tom Andrews, the United Nations' human rights expert on Myanmar, has called it a \"sham election\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks the junta has arrested civilians accused of disrupting the vote, including one man who authorities said had sent out anti-election messages on Facebook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The junta also said on Monday that it was looking for 10 activists involved in an anti-election protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ethnic armies and other opposition groups have pledged to boycott the polls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least one election candidate in in central Myanmar's Magway Region was detained by an anti-junta group, the Associated Press reported.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The other two species are Bornean and Sumatran orangutans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 900 people have died as a result of heavy rain, floods and landslides since Cyclone Senyar ravaged parts of Indonesia in late November. Hundreds are still missing, with many villages in Sumatra completely destroyed as the storm swept across the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Erik Meijaard, managing director of Borneo Futures in Brunei, is now studying the disasters' impact on the orangutans with the help of satellite images.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said 4,800 hectares (11,860 acres)  of forest on the mountain slopes can be seen as destroyed by landslides - but since part of the satellite image is cloud covered, he's extrapolated the destruction figure to 7,200 hectares in his preliminary observation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The destroyed areas would have contained some 35 orangutans, and considering the violence of the destruction it wouldn't surprise us if they are all dead. That's a major blow to the population,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These areas show as bare soil on satellite imagery where two weeks ago it was primary forest. Complete destruction. Many patches of several hectares completely denuded. It must have been hellish in the forest at the time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Mejjard said he too has seen the picture of the dead orangutan shared by Chandra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What struck me is that all the flesh had been ripped off the face,\" he said. \"If a few hectares of forest comes down in massive landslides, even powerful orangutans are helpless and just get mangled.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre which works for the conservation of the primates in the region, said the carcass meant it was highly possible some Tapanuli orangutans were unable to escape as rushing waters and landslides swept through their habitat.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04ed/live/875c4220-d655-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images An aerial shot of a mosque standing amid a sea of uprooted tea trunks\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Experts suggest that as much as 7,200 hectares of forest was destroyed in the recent cyclone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures showing the carcass of a Sumatran elephant, another critically endangered species, being swept away by floods in Aceh in northern Sumatra went viral on social media last week.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island hosts a range of endangered species like Sumatran tigers, elephants and rhinos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But conservation workers say there are particular concerns for orangutans and other primates, like gibbons, because huge parts of the mountainous forest in the Tapanuli district saw massive landslides due to Cyclone Senyar's extreme rainfall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some locals say the primates must have escaped before the disaster struck, as they can sense danger beforehand.

In Karen State it has driven back the forces of its main opponent, the Karen National Union, which it has been fighting for eight decades, and which has been one of the staunchest opponents of the coup.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Suddenly, at the end of October, the army stormed KK Park, one of the largest and most notorious scam compounds in Karen State, driving out thousands of foreigners who had been running online fraud schemes there, some voluntarily, some after being tricked or trafficked and forced to work. The army posted videos of soldiers confiscating thousands of mobile phones, computers and satellite dishes from Elon Musk's Starlink service. They began demolishing buildings with explosives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was a striking change of heart. For years, Myanmar's military rulers turned a blind eye to the multi-billion dollar scam business expanding rapidly along its border with Thailand. Local warlords allied to the military have been the principal protectors and business partners of the Chinese scam bosses, and have become very rich. Some of that money went into the coffers of the ruling generals. The junta has tried to blame the KNU for the scams, but there is no basis for this; unlike the other armed Karen groups, the KNU has kept its distance from the business.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c24l5301gg8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Billions of dollars have been lost globally by victims of romance scams</a>, people duped into get-rich-quick crypto schemes and elderly people investing their retirement money into bogus funds, many of which originate from these centres. The darkest side of the industry is felt in South East Asia, where these online fraud schemes are linked to human trafficking, money laundering and extensive human rights abuses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is growing international concern, and co-ordination between law-enforcement agencies, to try to combat this scourge. The US has set up a multi-agency anti-scam task force. China, one of the Myanmar military junta's closest allies, has been pressing it to do more for years because <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lq95j1yp9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">thousands of Chinese citizens have fallen victim both to online fraud</a> and to being trafficked and held for ransom in the compounds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the reports in Myanmar state media showcasing the military's actions in KK Park, it would appear that this pressure is finally working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet its demolitions in KK Park, while spectacular, do not appear to have destroyed the infrastructure for scamming there. And the military operations have focused only on this compound – there are dozens of others. It did raid the scam city of Shwe Kokko, but only entered a few buildings, and to date has demolished only one.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bf32/live/814f7de0-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head A damaged building inside KK Park as seen from across the Thai-Myanmar border. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some buildings in KK park looked heavily damaged</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thousands of foreign scam workers have left KK Park and Shwe Kokko, and made their way across the Moei River to Thailand. Many others have scattered to different locations, although transport is difficult and expensive. Just booking a car now costs 5,000 yuan, equivalent to about $700 (£520). The main scam bosses are presumed to have taken their businesses to more remote, less visible parts of Myanmar further south on the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in a town called Minletpan, one group of scam workers was trapped last month in two compounds, known as Shunda and Baoili. These have been built right by the river just in the past two years. They are in an area controlled by the DKBA, one of the militias allied to the military junta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 21 November, according to a KNU spokesman, their fighters were engaged in a battle with the army, when they found themselves being shot at from behind by the DKBA in Minletpan. They turned and drove out the DKBA, but then found themselves unexpectedly in control of the two scam centres, and the thousands of foreigners working there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The KNU announced that it wanted to set an example by inviting journalists and international law enforcement agencies to see the captured compounds. It published photographs and documents to expose how the scam business works, rather than destroying the evidence as the military has done in KK Park.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sent hundreds of workers over the river to Thailand, but around 1,000, mainly Chinese citizens, refused to leave, probably because they feared prosecution if they went back to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But aside from a handful of journalists, the international interest in its prize never materialised, and the junta's forces began shelling the area to try to retake the compounds – that's what we could hear from the Thai side. Many of the remaining scam workers have now fled elsewhere in Myanmar, though a few hundred remain camped under flimsy tarpaulins on the river bank, along with hundreds of local people, all hoping to avoid the artillery exchanges.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/21c5/live/e4447040-d4cd-11f0-8932-c7b981591a81.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/ Jonathan Head Clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">BBC/ Jonathan Head</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dust rises above KK Park as buildings were demolished</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this drama is down to one thing: <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg3pp4n952o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the junta's much criticised plan to hold an election later this month</a>. The civil war ignited by its coup is ravaging the country. The military regime is loathed by most of Myanmar's people, and is treated as a pariah internationally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The generals are looking for an off-ramp which will buy them a semblance of legitimacy, and win over some of their many opponents. They have chosen an election, but one in which the main opposition groups either cannot or will not take part, and where much of the country is in too much turmoil for voting to take place at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the military has made retaking as much territory from insurgents before the election a priority. It is also trying to clean up its image, by its high-profile operation against the scam compounds. This is especially important for its most powerful international ally, China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we were on the border, we saw clouds of dust rising above KK Park as more buildings were demolished. Some of the largest structures there were buckled and bent, their windows shattered; the walls of others were being torn down by excavators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the distance many buildings were still intact. Some had tell-tale white squares on their roofs that were almost certainly Starlink satellite dishes, suggesting some scam work might still be going on there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Drive an hour-and-half south in Thailand, and you reach a quiet border crossing called Wa Le – Wawlay in Burmese. The river is so narrow here it is little more than a stream; you walk over to Myanmar through an iron gate and across a little blue wooden bridge, where you are greeted by the flags of the KNU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while the territory around Wawlay is fiercely contested, with the KNU capturing several military bases earlier this year, the crossing is controlled by the DKBA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the Thai side large signs warn people of the risks of being lured into working for scam centres. Yet just a few metres away a walled compound, topped with razor wire, has been built right next to the river. This is known as Hengsheng 3; we could hear generators running and security guards talking on the other side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There were barred windows, and Starlink dishes on the roof. Monitoring groups have identified this and several other new compounds around Wawlay. Many more syndicates have moved even further south to Payathonzu, near the Three Pagodas Pass border crossing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Whatever the future of well-known scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko – and it is too soon to judge whether they really are being shut down – the scam business is still thriving in Myanmar.</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more about Myanmar's scam compounds</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

BBC Verify confirmed the ship was the Skipper by matching a sign seen in footage released by the US to a reference photo supplied by TankerTrackers.com, a site which monitors oil shipments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Data held by publicly accessible tracking sites paints an incomplete picture of the vessel's movements, and before its seizure it hadn't declared its position since 7 November. Maritime analytics firm Kpler also suggested that the vessel had engaged in a ship-to-ship transfer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Attorney General Pam Bondi <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1w9lg11jw0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">described the vessel as a \"crude oil tanker</a> used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US Treasury department first sanctioned the ship in 2022, when it was sailing under the name Adisa, and was accused of being part of an \"international oil smuggling network\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper has sailed under the flag of Guyana, but the government was quick to release a statement saying that the 20-year-old tanker was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts told BBC Verify that the Skipper was likely a part of the so-called \"dark fleet\" - a global network of oil tankers that seek to evade oil sanctions by obscuring their ownership, identities and travel histories.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Hiding its position</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a UN treaty, all ships above a certain tonnage must have an onboard tracker called an Automatic Identification System (AIS). These trackers broadcast information about the ships, including their location, and can be followed on websites like MarineTraffic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is an incomplete and misleading public record of the Skipper's movements. According to MarineTraffic, the Skipper's last known port call was at Soroosh in Iran on 9 July, where it arrived after stopping in Iraq and the UAE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Kpler suggests that this is part of a pattern of misleading entries by the Skipper. Analysts at the firm said the ship had previously loaded crude oil from Venezuela and Iran, while falsifying its position via its onboard tracker, a process known as spoofing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has some of the world's largest reserves of oil, but <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47036491\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">exports were placed under sanctions</a> in 2019 by the US in a bid to force the transition of power from President Nicholas Maduro's administration, which has been widely accused of election rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The firm noted that while its AIS showed the ship at Iraq's Basrah Oil Terminal on 7 and 8 July, terminal reports showed no record of the vessel there. Instead, the Skipper loaded crude oil at Kharg Island in Iran, Kpler said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper then sailed east, tracking data shows, where Kpler suggested it conducted a ship-to-ship transfer between 11 and 13 August. The cargo was later unloaded in China, where Kpler said it was \"falsely declared\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It returned via Iran and sailed towards the Caribbean. The Skipper last declared its position on 7 November, several miles off the coast of Guyana. Its location only reappeared on 10 December, after the US raid.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the interim period, satellite images identified by TankerTrackers.com and confirmed by BBC Verify show that the Skipper was present in the Port of Jose in Venezuela on 18 November and not appearing on tracking sites at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the imposition of sanctions, analysts say it has become common for ships to spoof or conceal their positions while loading oil in Venezuela.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kpler analysts said the ship loaded \"at least 1.1 million barrels of Merey crude\" by 16 November at the terminal and listed Cuba as the destination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also evidence that the Skipper was involved in a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel on 7 December, just days before it was boarded by US troops. Satellite images seen by Kpler appeared to show the exchange, with one of the vessels identified by Kpler as the Skipper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The transfer took place just off the coast of Venezuela, near the city of Barcelona.

A grotesque, charred silhouette, reclining, with one knee raised, as if lounging on one of Marseille's nearby beaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was 15 when he died, in the usual way: a bullet in the head, then petrol poured over his slim corpse and set on fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Someone even filmed the scene on the beach, the latest in a grim series of shoot-then-burn murders linked to this port city's fast-evolving drug wars, increasingly fuelled by social media and now marked by chillingly random acts of violence and by the growing role of children, often coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's chaos now,\" said a scrawny gang-member, lifting his shirt in a nearby park to show us a torso marked by the scars of at least four bullets - the result of an attempted assassination by a rival gang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France's Ministry of Justice estimates that the number of teenagers involved in the drugs trade has risen more than four-fold in the past eight years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've been in [a gang] since I was 15. But everything has changed now. The codes, the rules – there are no more rules. Nobody respects anything these days. The bosses start... to use youngsters. They pay them peanuts. And they end up killing others for no real reason.

It's obvious that the drug traffickers are dominant, and gaining more ground every day,\" said a local lawyer, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals against her or her family.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The rule of law is now subordinate to the gangs. Until we have a strong state again, we have to take precautions,\" she said, explaining her recent decision to stop representing victims of gang violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the summer, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3d1jdmg779o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">several French cities imposed night-time curfews</a> on teenagers after a spate of violence linked to drug trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Emmanuel Macron was holding talks on Thursday in an attempt to respond to the crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's so much competition in the drugs trade that... people are ready to do anything,\" said community organiser Mohamed Benmeddour. \"So, we have kids aged 13 or 14 who come in as lookouts or dealers. The young see dead bodies, they hear about it, every day. And they're no longer afraid of killing, or being killed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trigger for Marseille's current <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> was the murder, last month, of Mehdi Kessaci, a 20-year-old trainee policeman with no links to the drug trade. It is widely believed his death was intended as a warning to his brother, a prominent 22-year-old anti-gang activist and aspiring politician named Amine Kessaci.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under close police protection now, Kessaci spoke to the BBC about Mehdi's death, and the guilt he feels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Should I have made my family leave [Marseille]?

We've known that our lives are hanging by a single thread. But everything changed since Covid. The perpetrators are getting younger and younger. The victims are younger and younger,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My little brother was an innocent victim. There was a time when the real thugs... had a moral code. You don't kill in daytime. Not in front of everyone. You don't burn bodies. First you threaten with a shot to the leg... Today these steps have all disappeared.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Citing today's \"unprecedented\" levels of violence, French police are responding with what they call security \"bombardments\" in high-crime areas of Marseille.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although one gang, the DZ Mafia, now appears to dominate the trade, it operates a kind of franchise system, with a fractious network of small distributors often staffed by teenagers and undocumented immigrants, who clash violently over territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to one estimate, up to 20,000 people may be involved in the city's drug industry. Last year officials confiscated €42m (£36m) in criminal assets from the gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video footage shared on social media routinely shows gang members, armed with automatic rifles, shooting at each other in Marseille's various <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i> – poor neighbourhoods characterised by high-rise buildings and a concentration of social housing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold afternoon last week, we accompanied a group of armed riot police on one of their regular \"bombardment\" missions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers sped up to a dilapidated block of flats in their vans as a youthful gang look-out on the gate promptly fled on foot. Splitting into two groups, the police ran up either side of the building seeking to catch dealers in the stairwells.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The aim is to disrupt the drug dealing spots. We've closed more than 40 of them... and we've locked up a lot of people,\" explained Sébastien Lautard, a regional police chief.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC films arrests in Marseille drug raid</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Turn him round,\" said an officer, brusquely, as his team pinned an 18-year-old up against a door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a filthy cellar nearby, the police found dozens of vials and tiny plastic bags used to distribute cocaine. Later, a policeman explained that the young man they had detained was pleading to be arrested, saying he had come to Marseille from another city, and was now being held against his will and forced to work for a drug gang. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officers took him away in a van.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not El Dorado. We have a lot of youngsters recruited on social media. They come to Marseille thinking they'll make easy money. They're promised €200 ($233;£175) a day. But it often ends in misery, violence and sometimes death,\" said the city's chief prosecutor, Nicolas Bessone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his office close to the city's old harbour, Bessone described an industry thought to be worth up to €7bn nationwide and characterised by two new developments: a growing emphasis on online recruitment, sales, and delivery; and a rising number of teenagers coerced into the trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We now see how the traffickers enslave these... little soldiers. They create fictional debts to make them work for free. They torture them if they steal €20 to buy a sandwich. It's ultra-violence. The average age of the perpetrators and victims is getting younger and younger,\" said Bessone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He urged local people not to succumb to a <i id=\"psychose\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">psychose</i> but instead to \"react, to rise up\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawyer who asked us to hide her identity described a case she had handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One young person, who absolutely didn't want to be part of a network, was picked up after school, forced to participate in the drugs trade, was raped, then threatened, then his family also threatened. All means are used to create a workforce,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tiktok, dozens of videos, set to music, advertise drugs for sale in Marseille's <i id=\"cités\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">cités</i>, \"from 10:00 to midnight\", each product with its own emoji, for cocaine, hashish and marijuana. Other adverts seek to recruit new gang members with messages like \"recruiting a worker\", \"€250 for lookouts\", \"€500 to carry drugs\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For some local politicians, the answer to Marseille's troubles is a state of emergency, and far tougher rules on immigration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Authority must be restored. We need to end a culture of permissiveness in our country. We need to give more freedom, more power to the police and the judiciary,\" said Franck Alissio, a local MP for the populist, far-right National Rally party, and a prospective mayoral candidate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the ancient Mediterranean city of Marseille has, for centuries, been known for its large immigrant community, Alissio argued that \"today, the problem is that we are no longer able to integrate economically and assimilate. Too much immigration. It's the number [of immigrants] that's the problem. And in fact, the drug traffickers, dealers, lookouts, the leaders of these mafia, are almost all immigrants or foreigners with dual nationality.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a controversial claim that is hard to verify in a country that strives to avoid including such details in official figures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alissio claimed that billions of euros had been poured into Marseille's poorest neighborhoods by successive governments to no effect. He blamed parents and schools for allowing children into the drugs trade but added that he was focused on \"solving the problem, not doing sociology\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far-right parties have long enjoyed strong support across the south of France, but less so in the diverse city of Marseille itself. Critics of the RN, like the lawyer whose identity we have concealed, accused the party of \"exploiting misery and fear,\" and wrongly blaming immigrants for a \"gangrene\" that is widespread across all communities in France.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Philippe Pujol, a local writer and expert on the drug trade in Marseille, was also offered police protection after the murder of Mehdi Kessaci last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not sure if there's a good reason for this terror. But... terror is taking hold. I would rather be afraid and careful than take unnecessary risks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he hit back against calls for tougher police action, arguing it was merely nursing the symptoms \"of a suffering society\", rather than treating the causes of the problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Describing entrenched poverty as a \"monster,\" Pujol painted a picture of a society radicalised by decades of neglect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The monster is a mixture of patronage, corruption, and political and economic decisions made against the public interest,\" Pujol said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These kids can be jerks when they're in a group, but when you're alone with them, they're still children, with dreams, who don't want this violence.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Bondi said a seizure warrant for the tanker was carried out by the US Coast Guard, FBI, Homeland Security Investigations and the Pentagon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exact location of the tanker at the time of the seizure is not clear, but a senior military official told BBC's US partner CBS News that the vessel had just left a port in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 45-second video shows a US team walking the deck of the ship with their weapons drawn. No ship crew are visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seizure involved two helicopters, 10 marines and 10 US Coast Guard members, and special operations forces, a source familiar with the operation told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The boarding of the vessel involved an elite group of the Coast Guard called the Maritime Security and Response Team, the source said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This team is trained in counterterrorism and high-risk law enforcement boarding procedures – like the fast-rope boarding from a helicopter seen in the video. It was created after the September 11 attacks, during an overhaul of national security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Coast Guard led the operation with support from the Navy, officials told CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Victor Hansen, a former military lawyer and law professor at New England Law in Boston, said that the Trump administration has \"not been really clear in articulating a legal justification\" for the seizure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't seem to be relying on a military justification, unlike the targeting of the [drug] boats,\" he added. \"This seems more related to violating sanctions imposed on both Venezuela and Iran.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Mr Hansen, military operations including \"visit, board, search and seizure\" missions at sea always include both \"formal and off-the-cuff\" inputs from military lawyers both before and during the operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But they have no command authority to approve or refuse an operation,\" he added. \"What they do is advise commanders on the legalities, risks and rewards.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if the Venezuelan seizure was carried out by non-military law enforcement units such as those from the Coast Guard, \"there are lawyers that would serve similar roles.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hansen also noted that while ship boarding missions have taken place in the past - such as in the Persian Gulf or Arabian Sea - the recent incident is distinct in that the ship was seized in addition to its cargo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's not something that has been done in the recent past,\" he said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7bb5/live/4af1fde0-d67b-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Planet Labs PBC An overhead view of two oil tankers at sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Planet Labs PBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Skipper (the vessel on the right) was filmed by satellite on 18 November at the José Terminal, a facility in Barcelona, Venezuela, which is used by crude oil tankers</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The oil tanker</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech identified the vessel as the Skipper and said it believed the ship had been \"spoofing\" its position - or broadcasting a false location - for a long time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vanguard Tech said the vessel was \"reported to be part of the dark fleet, and was sanctioned by the United States for carrying Venezuelan oil exports\". The dark fleet refers to ships used to smuggle sanctioned goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have left the oil port of Jose on either 4 or 5 December, with about 1.8 million barrels of heavy crude oil on board, with about 200,000 barrels transferred to another vessel before the seizure, Reuters reported, citing analysis from TankerTrackers.com and the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US treasury department sanctioned the Skipper in 2022, CBS reported, for alleged involvement in oil smuggling that generated revenue for the Hezbollah group in Lebanon and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Quds Force in Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify located the tanker on MarineTraffic, which shows that the vessel was sailing under the flag of Guyana when its position was last updated two days prior to the seizure. A statement from Guyana's Maritime Administration Department on Wednesday evening, however, said that the Skipper was \"falsely flying the Guyana Flag as it is not registered in Guyana\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MarineTraffic shows it was last near Iran in mid-September before arriving off the coast of Guyana at the end of October and making minimal further movement since then. This data may be partial or incorrect because of spoofing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The seized oil</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked by reporters what the US would do with the oil carried by the tanker, Trump said: \"We keep it, I guess... I assume we're going to keep the oil.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global crude oil prices are trading at roughly $61 (£46) a barrel, meaning the stash aboard the Skipper could be worth more than $95m - if it does indeed comprise 1.6m barrels after 200,000 were removed. The BBC has not verified how much oil is on board the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi, the top prosecutor in the US, said of the seized vessel: \"For multiple years, the oil tanker has been sanctioned by the United States due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has accused the US of using its ongoing military buildup in the Caribbean and \"war on drugs\" to try and depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's oil - something the US denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela sits on the largest known reserves of crude oil in the world. But analysts have highlighted complexities. The oil is considered \"heavy\" and highly viscous, meaning that extracting it needs special equipment and knowledge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has also had difficulties exporting its vast resources because of ageing infrastructure and heavy sanctions from the US.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The world's largest warship - the USS Gerald Ford - was used as a staging post for Wednesday's tanker seizure</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The wider US pressure campaign</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has focused for much of the last year on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the effort, Trump designated two Venezuelan criminal groups - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations and has alleged that the latter is led by Maduro himself. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without providing evidence, Trump has also accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US. Stopping immigration has been another priority for the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of the pressure campaign, the US has deployed 15,000 troops and a range of aircraft carriers, guided-missile destroyers, and amphibious assault ships to the Caribbean. Among them is the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald Ford - from which helicopters took off as part of the tanker seizure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mick Mulroy, a former Marine, CIA paramilitary officer and deputy under secretary of defence at the Pentagon, told the BBC that the seizure of the tanker will \"amp up pressure\" on the Venezuelan government amid the broader campaign. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Venezuela has a considerable amount of oil reserves,\" he said. \"Seizing a tanker transporting oil or a tanker carrying the chemicals needed to pump the crude oil out of the ground sends a message, specifically if this is just the beginning of a campaign.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since early September, US forces have carried out more than 20 strikes in international waters on boats alleged to have been carrying drugs. More than 80 people have been killed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration argues that it is involved in a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers, whom it accuses of conducting irregular warfare against the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also described those on board as \"narco terrorists\" but legal experts say the strikes are unlawful as that designation \"did not transform them into lawful military targets\".</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

As an adult, he also assaulted a person in his theatre troupe and had his driving licence suspended for drink driving, the report said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 49-year-old's agency said that Cho Jin-woong had confirmed wrongdoing in his youth, but denied sexually assaulting anyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Broadcasters have scrambled to erase Cho Jin-woong from their platforms. A documentary series he narrated has now had the narration re-recorded, while the fate of Second Signal, the sequel to his hit TV series, remains unclear.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A debate over cancel culture</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The allegations Cho Jin-woong faces have stirred heated debate about how much public figures should be forgiven for past mistakes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why does Cho Jin-woong need to retire?\" reads one social media comment. \"Why should a flawed past remain the standard by which a person is judged decades later?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others, however, have argued that seeing him on screen could retraumatise his past victims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are people who defend [Cho Jin-woong] by saying everyone makes mistakes when they're young, but not everyone commits this level of crime,\" wrote one social media user.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, the recent string of celebrity scandals has raised bigger questions about the standards to which South Koreans hold their celebrities. It's a system that has sent rising stars into hiatus for <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56235160\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">being school bullies</a>, and squeezed apologies out of them for <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68487232\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">simply dating other celebrities</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC that in South Korea, audiences want to correct behaviour that they deem unacceptable - which, in the case of celebrities, often means disappearing from the screens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Celebrities are easy targets because their careers depend on reputation and popularity - things that are granted by the public,\" culture critic Kim Sung-soo tells the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, just as Park, Cho Sae-ho and Cho Jin-woong promised to \"reflect deeply\" on their actions, it appears some among their audiences are also reflecting on how celebrities are treated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's absurd that people mistake this recurring pattern of targeting celebrities online - digging for flaws and pushing them out - as a moral issue,\" one person wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm tired of this cancel-culture cycle, and I think it's time for our society to seriously rethink online communities.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The equipment has been distributed free to local retail businesses by the city council.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The buyer pays by contactless, from the bitcoin wallet on his mobile phone. The bill comes to 0.00008629, which is roughly $8.80 (£6.60).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few people who have bought bitcoin would probably think about using it to purchase actual things in shops. It is instead generally seen as an investment, a bet on its value going up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in Lugano, in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland, it's a different story.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While you can of course still pay for everything in Swiss francs, some 350 shops and restaurants now also accept bitcoin. The local authority has even started taking payments in crypto currency for municipal services. You can, for example, pay for pre-school childcare in bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I get talking to the McDonald's customer, Nicolas, who comes from France. He is what you might call a bitcoin true believer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's great about paying in bitcoin is the feeling of freedom it gives you,\" he says. \"You are no longer dependant on a financial system with its middlemen and its costs.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolas says he's discovered bitcoin cards in Switzerland. These are prepaid gift cards. You buy a certain sum in Swiss francs but download it in bitcoin onto a digital wallet on your phone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I walk through the centre of Lugano, down a high street where just about all the shops sell luxury stuff. Jewellery or expensive clothes mainly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a shop called Vintage Nassa that sells new and second-hand bags and watches, the owner Cherubino Fry tells me he accepts bitcoin because the processing fee he has to pay per transaction is less than those charged by credit card companies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For bitcoin it is generally below 1%, while for debit cards it can be as high as 1.7%, and up to 3.4% for credit cards. Although for the latter two it can vary from country to country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I ask Mr Fry if he does much business in bitcoin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In reality, not a lot. For now, only sporadically, only some clients,\" he says. \"But using bitcoin will be like a tree growing, and this tree will grow very big in five, 10 years.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Users pay via bitcoin using a suitable app on their mobile phone</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A stone's throw from Mr Fry's shop, I visit the headquarters of Plan B, an initiative launched in 2022 by the City of Lugano in collaboration with crypto currency platform Tether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the B standing for bitcoin, its stated aim is to educate people about cryptocurrency, and \"to make Lugano the European hub for bitcoin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I want to talk about an experiment I did this July,\" says Plan B hub director Mir Liponi. She explains that she had a problem with her bank, which resulted in her not being able to access her funds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For 11 days she had no way of paying, other than with bitcoin, but she says that experiment turned out well, and that you can mostly survive just on bitcoin in Lugano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's missing public transportation at the moment… another one is fuel. Groceries are okay. I got things delivered at home, even.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Plenty of medical places, but not a dentist. And another big thing is [energy] bills. You cannot pay bills in bitcoin yet.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liponi adds that in the future she wants to see \"circular economies where people earn bitcoin, keep bitcoin, spend bitcoin, pay for services in bitcoin\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet elsewhere, similar bitcoin projects to Lugano's have come unstuck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021, El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar. To encourage its use the government gave people the bitcoin equivalent of $30 that they downloaded via an app.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So what people did was download the app, exchange the bitcoin for dollars and never use it again,\" says Vincent Charles, head of crypto currency firm Unchain Data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He went to El Salvador earlier this year to see how bitcoin uptake was going, and concluded that people don't really use it, and retailers and service providers rarely accept it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there are other successful bitcoin adoption examples from around the globe. Slovenian capital Ljubljana was declared the world's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:94eac69ce094b:0-slovenia-s-capital-of-ljubljana-ranked-as-world-s-most-crypto-friendly-city/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">most crypto-friendly city</a> in a report back in April, followed by Hong Kong and Zurich.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Shopkeeper Cherubino Fry expects the use of bitcoin to grow strongly</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Lugano, not everyone is seemingly impressed with bitcoin. In a park on the lakefront there used to be a statue representing Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the unknown person or persons who claim to have invented the crypto currency back in 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, vandals <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vandalism-against-satoshi-nakamoto-statue-130409546.html\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">broke the sculpture</a> into bits and threw it into Lake Lugano.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's interesting because not that many things get vandalised around here,\" says Lucia, a passerby who lives in the city. \"People are usually fairly well behaved.

As the smaller country it feels at a disadvantage in bilateral negotiations with Thailand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on the border its troops have continued to engage in confrontations with the Thai army, and, in a move guaranteed to anger the Thai public, to lay new land-mines which have so far caused seven Thai soldiers to lose limbs. Thailand has presented compelling evidence of this, accused Cambodia of bad faith, and refused to release 18 of its soldiers captured in July.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since July, any restraint there was on the Thai armed forces has gone. The current prime minister Anutin Charvirakul heads a minority coalition, and is beset with other challenges. He has given the military carte blanche to manage the border conflict as it sees fit. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The army has said its goal is to inflict sufficient damage on its Cambodian counterpart to ensure it can never again threaten border communities. It also wants to take control of several hill-top positions which would give its soldiers greater advantage in any future battles with Cambodian forces. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both sides have been manoeuvring around these positions all year, trying to reinforce roads access and fortifications around them. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thais believed they were on track to push the Cambodians back when they were forced to stop in July.

Publicly he has appealed for restraint by his troops, portraying Cambodia as being bullied by a more powerful neighbour and in need of international support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet his interventions in this simmering border dispute have been decisive this year, in particular his decision to leak a confidential phone conversation with the then-Thai PM Paetongtarn Shinawatra, whose father Thaksin was a long-standing friend and business partner of Hun Sen's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her leaked comments, praising him and condemning her own army commanders for being too gung-ho, were catastrophic for her and her father. Her government collapsed, he has gone to jail, and many Thais, even those bitterly opposed to the Shinawatra family, have been angered by the perception that Cambodia has been meddling in Thai politics. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thai public opinion is now much more in favour of their army's hard-line approach to Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Can President Trump bang heads together again as he did in July? Perhaps. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if all he achieves is another ceasefire it will only be a matter of time before fighting breaks out again. And Thailand has said repeatedly that it is not yet ready for diplomacy. Cambodia, it says, must show sincerity before it is ready to try for a ceasefire again. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What that means exactly is not clear, but at the very least it would require a decisive and verified end to the use of land-mines on the border.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
