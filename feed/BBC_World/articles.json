Trump has warned Iran that if it kills protesters, the US would \"hit\" the country \"very hard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel, have been killed, according to human rights groups.

It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran.

In some cases, they denied protests had taken place altogether, posting videos of empty streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, internet watchdog NetBlocks said its metrics showed that Iran was \"in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The incident follows a series of escalating digital censorship measures targeting protests across the country and hinders the public's right to communicate at a critical moment,\" it warned, referring to previous losses of connectivity in several cities.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTQaP2liWDP/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">footage from Lomar, a small town in the western province of Ilam, showed a crowd chanting \"Cannons, tanks, fireworks, mullahs must go\"</a> - a reference to the clerical establishment.

This is a tense moment.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian earlier called on security forces to exercise \"utmost restraint\" when handling peaceful protests. \"Any violent or coercive behaviour should be avoided,\" a statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khamenei - who has ultimate power in Iran - said on Saturday that authorities should \"speak with the protesters\" but that \"rioters should be put in their place\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests began on 28 December, when shopkeepers took to the streets of Tehran to express their anger at another sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, the rial, against the US dollar on the open market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rial has sunk to a record low over the past year and inflation has soared to 40% as sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme squeeze an economy also weakened by government mismanagement and corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">University students soon joined the protests and they began spreading to other cities, with crowds frequently heard chanting slogans critical of the clerical establishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In messages sent to the BBC, via a UK-based activist, a woman in Tehran said despair was driving the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're living in limbo,\" she said. \"I feel like I'm hanging in the air with neither wings to migrate nor hope to pursue my goals here. Life here has become unbearable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another said she was protesting because her dreams had been \"stolen\" by the clerical establishment and she wanted it to know that \"we still have a voice to shout, a fist to punch them in the face.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A woman in the western city of Ilam said she knew of young people from families affiliated with the establishment who were taking part in protests. \"My friend and her three sisters, whose father is a well-known figure in the intelligence services, are joining without their father knowing,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since an uprising in 2022 sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

He said his administration would work to strike a \"deal\" with companies to bring his vision for reviving the industry to reality. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela sits on top of some of the world's largest reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But its production has dropped off sharply in recent decades due to disinvestment and mismanagement - not to mention US sanctions, which have limited its access to the global market. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At roughly 1 million barrels per day, the country's production now accounts for less than 1% of global supply. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has said it is working to \"selectively\" roll back those restrictions, but Trump officials have also made clear they intend to exert control over sales of Venezuelan oil, as a way to maintain leverage over the Venezuelan government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US this week has seized several oil tankers carrying sanctioned crude. US officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are open for business,\" Trump said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron said it expected to bolster output, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to go to Venezuela,\" said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. \"In real estate terms, it is prime real estate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars,\" said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US State Department special envoy for international energy affairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Major oil companies like Exxon and Shell are \"not going to invest single digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars\", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not really welcome from an industry point of view,\" he said. \"The conditions are just not right.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, he added that smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year. But those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the \"fantastical\" $100bn figure that Trump has floated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-danielle-kaye\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Danielle Kaye</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized  President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as \"safe\" and \"effective\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019. The new Venezuelan authorities have said they're engaged in exploratory talks on restoring relations.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlz7r0zrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">after a CIA source in Venezuelan government</a> helped the US track his location.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gustavo Petro said Colombia preferred dialogue with the US, but added the country's history showed \"how it has responded to large armies\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" adding: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro denied the claims, saying it has \"always been proven that I'm not involved in that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a \"total peace\" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described \"two simultaneous approaches.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, \"where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred\" and \"where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most.\" Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to \"de-escalate violence\", adding: \"we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a \"pathway\" for the special forces to enter unseen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed.

One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,\" says Fitzgerald. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CBS Charred, burnt out cars in what looks to have been a car park\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CBS</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, was hit by US strikes as part of the operation</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The plan</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power.

and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It hasn't really changed anything,\" Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his mum Mau has noticed a change.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Supplied A young boy, with his arms crossed, floating on a inflatable orange ring in a pool with greenery and a waterfall in the background \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Supplied</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aahil, 13, spends more than two hours a day on social media, mainly playing games.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's moodier,\" she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us,\" Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the \"teenage years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban's short-term effects on emotion regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many teenagers, social media isn't just entertainment - it's a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Snapchat's out, WhatsApp's in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old,\" says 15-year-old Lulu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new law has influenced her in other ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am reading a bit more because I don't want to be on social media as much.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she's not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook's Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn't contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it's social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The enjoyment doesn't come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention,\" she says, \"knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When that \"emotional lift\" fades, the platform begins to feel \"oddly unsocial\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kids flock to apps as FOMO sets in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what's known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don't simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall in downloads suggested \"a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere,\" Blacker says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she has never used it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don't feel any need to download or use alternative platforms.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account,\" he says, so \"they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Gaming 'much harder to get into'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months before the ban, debate swirled around the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w90kqgv9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">exclusion of gaming platforms</a>, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there's no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it's a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that's also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Johnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is \"making a real difference\" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays,\" the spokesperson says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Time will tell</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Supplied A partial hand, holding a pen, poised over an open page of an empty diary.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.</p></div></div></body></html>"

removing age and term limits - that have allowed him to keep running for office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He argues that he remains the country's sole guarantor of stability and progress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><b id=\"bobi-wine---national-unity-platform-(nup)\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Bobi Wine -

This time round officials say the vote will be free and fair but UN experts have warned that may not be the case, citing what they describe as a \"pervasive climate of fear\" in Uganda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the campaign period, opposition supporters have faced escalating harassment, including arrest on politically motivated charges, rights groups say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bobi Wine's rallies, unlike those of Museveni, have been disrupted by security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amnesty International described the use of tear gas, pepper spray, beatings, and other violent acts as \"a brutal campaign of repression\" ahead of the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government says the measures are necessary to ensure a peaceful election and prevent anyone from inciting riots on polling day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it comes to the election itself, Bobi Wine has urged voters to stay at polling stations and safeguard their ballots to help prevent vote rigging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But election officials have said people should cast their ballots peacefully and then leave, assuring that the vote counting will be transparent and observed by party agents, the media and election monitors. Critics, however, have questioned the independence of the electoral commission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite government denials, there are also fears, based on previous experience, of an internet shutdown during the election aimed at preventing people from verifying results.

His supporters saw him as a pan-Africanist, who supported causes such as the campaign against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To his critics, he was a dictator who oversaw numerous human rights abuses until he was driven from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barre initially fled to Kenya, but Moi's government came under intense pressure from parliament and rights groups for hosting him. Barre was then given political asylum by Nigeria, then under military ruler Gen Ibrahim Babangida, and lived in Lagos until he died of a diabetes-related illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the sensitivity of the mission, the pilots asked the Nigerian diplomat to give them one more day to think about his request.

Michael Chakma was allegedly struck on the head with a metal bracelet, while Anjel Chakma suffered stab wounds. Michael has recovered but Anjel died 17 days later in hospital, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police in Uttarakhand state (whose capital is Dehradun) have arrested five people in connection with the incident, but they have denied that the attack was racially motivated - a claim that Chakma's family strongly disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which has triggered protests in several cities, has put the spotlight on allegations of racism faced by people from India's north-eastern states when they move to larger cities for education or work. They say they are often mocked over their appearance, questioned about nationality and harassed in public spaces and workplaces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For many, the discrimination extends beyond abuse to everyday barriers that shape where and how they live. People from the region report difficulty renting accommodation, with landlords refusing tenants because of their appearance, food habits or stereotypes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such pressures have led many north-eastern migrants in large cities to cluster in specific neighbourhoods, offering safety, mutual support and cultural familiarity far from home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while many say they learn to endure everyday prejudices to build lives elsewhere in the country, violent crimes such as Anjel Chakma's killing are deeply unsettling.

No specific anti-racism legislation has been enacted, and many of the recommendations remain only partially implemented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has sought clarification from the federal government, but they are yet to respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The renewed demands over an anti-racism law have revived a broader debate over whether legislation can address prejudice, often seen as rooted in social behaviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts and activists such as Chakma and Golmei argue that it can. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They cite laws criminalising dowry and caste-based atrocities, arguing that while these haven't ended abuse, they have empowered victims and raised awareness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An anti-racism law could empower victims, improve reporting and place racial abuse clearly within the scope of criminal accountability,\" Golmei said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile in Tripura, Tarun Chakma mourns his elder son while facing uncertainty over his younger one: Michael, a final-year sociology student, is expected to return to Dehradun to complete his studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While family members have urged caution, Tarun Chakma says he is torn between fear for his son's safety and the belief that abandoning his education would amount to another loss. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At the end of the day, higher education for a better future was the reason for which we had sent our sons so far away from home,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"
