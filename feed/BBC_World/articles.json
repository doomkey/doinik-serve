He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The STC's advances included the oil-rich Hadramawt province that borders Saudi Arabia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said the offensive was necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south.

It previously accused the companies of selling their products at unfairly low prices and threatened tariffs of almost 92%.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tariffs are a type of tax paid by a consumer who imports a product. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has unleashed a wide-ranging programme of these taxes, though some have since been softened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has sought to address trade practices that he sees as harmful to the US and boost American manufacturing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But economists have consistently warned that such moves can ultimately drive up costs for consumers, worsening cost-of-living issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the case of pasta, the US alleged that Italian-made goods were being sold at \"less than normal value\" in the US, which undercut local producers. This pricing policy is sometimes known as dumping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The commerce department was planning to charge a tariff rate of 91.74% for American imports of pasta made by the 13 Italian producers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that there is now an underlying 15% tariff on most products bought into the US from the European Union, the plan would have resulted in the rate of tax on pasta exceeding 100% of its value. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It sparked fears of consumers experiencing major price increases, although the produce made by the 13 companies represents only a small share of total Italian pasta imported into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan would have also represented a political headache for Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who enjoys a relatively close relationship with Trump among European leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, the Italian foreign ministry announced that the US had wound back its plan, saying this represented \"an acknowledgement by the US authorities of the constructive co-operation shown by Italian companies\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the case of one brand, La Molisana, the tariff rate had been dropped as low as 2.26%, the Italian statement added. Others will face slightly higher rates, up to 13.98%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement of their own, which was given to the BBC's US partner CBS News, a US commerce department spokesperson said: \"[Our] post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other Trump tariffs that have recently been softened include a planned increase in the tax charged on imports of furniture items - which was postponed for 12 months shortly before it was due to take effect on New Year's Day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in November, the president signed an order that allowed certain key food products - including coffee, bananas and beef - to escape his tariffs.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The drop was partly due to the repeal of a government subsidy that had helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,570) off the price of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wall Street analysts have recently lowered their Tesla sales estimates for 2026, signalling an increasingly gloomy outlook.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese firms such as Geely, MG, and BYD - now the country's largest electric car company - have put pressure on Western rivals by pricing their vehicles below established brands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, Tesla responded by launching<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9y3dvy491o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> <b id=\"lower-priced-versions-of-its-two-best-selling-models\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">lower-priced versions of its two best selling models</b></a> in the US in a bid to boost sales.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89d3547npjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">who is already the world's richest man</a>, is tasked with significantly boosting Tesla's sales and stock market value over the next decade to secure a record-breaking pay package.

Tesla has invested heavily in its \"Optimus\" product and self-driving \"Robotaxis\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving rollout in 2026, which has helped send its share price to a record high, will be crucial to its overall performance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though there are <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c783qd14zl7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">big questions</a> surrounding Tesla self-driving ambitions, some remain optimistic. Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities says Tesla will own about 70% of the self-driving market over the next decade \"as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope\" of the firm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides Tesla, Musk's business interests also include the social media platform X, the rocket firm SpaceX and the Boring Company, which digs tunnels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those commitments, along with running US President Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) early last year, led some investors to suggest that Musk was not focusing enough on Tesla.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0x50yr46lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Musk has since</a> stepped back from his role in the US government.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite BYD's rise in recent years, its sales growth slowed in 2025 to the weakest rate in five years, in part due to fierce competition in China, its key market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And despite BYD surpassing Tesla when it comes to car sales, the US firm has remained more profitable in recent quarters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, BYD remains a global EV powerhouse as its prices often undercut rival carmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Shenzhen-based company's<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>rapid expansion - especially in Latin America, South East Asia and parts of Europe - comes despite many countries imposing steep tariffs on Chinese EVs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, BYD said the UK had become its <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3w5jl2jgqwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">biggest market outside China</a>.

After scaring the predatory cat off, they checked the body and could find no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) Spokesperson Kara Van Hoose said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not known if one or multiple animals were involved in the attack, she added. Two mountain lions have been euthanised after an extensive search, and investigators are currently studying them for signs of human DNA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hikers had thrown rocks at the mountain lion to drive it away, Ms Van Hoose told a press conference. CPW officers responding to the scene shot the lion, which ran off. They then tracked it to euthanise it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A second lion was found in the area and was also euthanised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If neither lion appears to be the culprit, the search will resume for a possible attacker. Under CPW rules, wildlife that kills a human being must be euthanised for public safety reasons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The woman's body showed signs of a mountain lion attack, according to Ms Van Hoose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The local sheriff's office has notified her next of kin, and will later release her identity, Ms Van Hoose told the BBC. She is believed to have been hiking alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Crosier Mountain Trail is north of Denver, near the Wyoming border, and close to Rocky Mountain National Park. It could be considered secluded, Ms Van Hoose said, adding hikers often lose their cell signals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Larimer County sheriff, police from the nearby city of Estes Park, and volunteer firefighters have been assisting in the search.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A biologist conducting a deer survey by helicopter in the area helped look for the animal and transport personnel, according to CPW. Meanwhile, houndsmen brought dogs in to track scents, which Ms Van Hoose said is an often-effective way to locate mountain lions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mountain lion attacks - both fatal and not - are rare in the state, with CPW recording 28 total since 1990.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mountain lions, also called pumas, cougars, catamounts or panthers, can be found throughout North America, but now are mostly in 15 western states, according to the Mountain Lion Foundation.  They are mostly solitary animals, who spend most of their time hunting, according to the foundation. </p></div></div></body></html>"

But the clinic warns that the risk of bleeding from aspirin also goes up with age. It says the daily dose for aspirin therapy is between 75mg and 325mg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president also talked about the medical scan he received at Walter Reed National Medical Center, which he previously said was an MRI scan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It wasn't an MRI,\" Trump told the Journal. \"It was less than that. It was a scan.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor for Trump, Navy Capt Sean Barbabella, said in a statement provided to the Journal that Trump had undergone a CT scan, \"to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues\" and that the testing revealed no abnormalities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older people, he was advised to wear compression socks but he declined. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I didn't like them,\" Trump said, adding that he now gets up from his desk more regularly, which has improved swelling in his legs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the president said he preferred not to do any form of regular exercise, other than golfing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just don't like it. It's boring,\" Trump said. \"To walk on a treadmill or run on a treadmill for hours and hours like some people do, that's not for me.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president maintained that he had not nodded off during public meetings, saying he closed his eyes at times because he finds it \"relaxing\". As for the bruising seen on his hands in some photos, Trump said he now carried makeup in case his hand got \"whacked\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have makeup that's, you know, easy to put on, takes about 10 seconds,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he did not have trouble with his hearing, and when photographers have taken photos of him when he appears to be sleeping, he said \"sometimes they'll take a picture of me blinking\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And they'll catch me with the blink.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Barbabella said in the statement to the Journal that Trump was in \"exceptional health and perfectly suited to execute his duties as Commander in Chief\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden, dropped out of the 2024 election race after a stumbling debate with Trump raised questions about his age and mental sharpness.</p></div></div></body></html>"

If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Maduro was elusive in the interview. Asked if he could confirm or deny the attack, Maduro said \"this could be something we talk about in a few days\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as drug trafficking, Maduro also said he was open for talks on oil and migration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months, Trump has focused on fighting the influx of drugs - especially fentanyl and cocaine - into the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president has also doubled the reward for information leading to Maduro's capture and has announced that he would designate the Maduro government as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without providing evidence, Trump has accused Maduro of \"emptying his prisons and insane asylums\" and \"forcing\" its inmates to migrate to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Close to eight million Venezuelans are estimated to have fled the country's economic crisis and repression since 2013 - some heading for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also been cracking down on <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g562vz34ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sanctioned oil tankers </a>entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces seized an oil tanker off Venezuela on 10 December, saying it was \"used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran\". Venezuela described it as an act of \"international piracy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the US has seized one more oil tanker and pursued a third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has cast its operations against alleged drug boats as a non-international armed conflict against the alleged traffickers, but legal experts say they could be in violation of the laws governing such conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted are carrying drugs. But the US Southern Command again insisted this week that \"intelligence confirmed the vessels were transiting along known narco-trafficking routes and engaged in narco-trafficking\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Despite being treated by a local doctor, the child died within three days. Mr Sahu alleges that the tap water killed his son.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Avyan is among several people suspected to have died after drinking contaminated water in Indore's Bhagirathpura neighbourhood. Investigations are still going on but officials say that a pipeline leak led to sewage mixing with drinking water, leading to a diarrhoea outbreak in the area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The exact death toll remains unclear. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Mohan Yadav said postmortem reports have so far confirmed four deaths linked to contaminated drinking water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the number is likely to increase. While state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya says he has heard about eight deaths so far, local journalists told BBC Hindi that the toll is close to 14. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 200 people have been admitted to hospitals in the city.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past week, around 40,000 residents of Bhagirathpura - a neighbourhood of largely poor and lower-middle income families - were screened by health authorities and around 2,450 cases of vomiting and diarrhoea were identified, said the government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deaths in Indore - often ranked India's cleanest city - have sparked an uproar and put the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the defensive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">District Magistrate Shivam Verma said the leak that caused the contamination has been fixed and officials are checking for others.

Eleven using Kali's illusion powers to make it seem as though she died before making a grand escape. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6c10/live/17d22aa0-e6f9-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Netflix Brett Gelman, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Amybeth McNulty, Caleb McLaughlin, Winona Ryder and Linnea Berthelsen in Stranger Things\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Netflix</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he thinks she finally made it the place they talked about running off to – a land with three waterfalls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mike says it's what he likes to believe – and each member of their Dungeons and Dragons party – Will, Dustin, Lucas and Max – all agree that they, too, believe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a fitting end that leaves open the possibility that Eleven, too, has a happy ending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The epilogue takes us 18 months into the future after the Upside Down is demolished and Vecna – and the Mind Flayer – is defeated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We see Hopper and Joyce get engaged and the older crew of teens talk about their lives in university and in their careers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a happy ending for everyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even with such an epic finale, there are certainly holes in the story that weren't fully explained in the last episode. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's sure to be a finale that pleases some fans and has others wanting more.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed12/live/0b5063d0-e6f1-11f0-858c-317495da6677.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Guests attend Stranger Things 5: The Finale Fan Screenings at The Park Theatre on December 31, 2025 in Vancouver, British Columbia.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Several fans dressed up to attend the finale screenings -

A serviceman standing next to the wreckage claims it is a Ukrainian Chaklun drone. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC hasn't been able to verify the footage, and it is not possible to locate where it was shot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia would review its position on the ongoing peace negotiations as a result of the alleged incident, the Kremlin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, on Wednesday described the Russian claims as a \"deliberate distraction\" and an attempt to derail the peace process.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: BBC's Steve Rosenberg asks Russians what they are hoping for in 2026</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his 20-minute address to the nation, Zelensky said that Ukraine did not want peace \"at any cost\", adding that \"we want the end of the war – not the end of Ukraine\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that a Ukrainian withdrawal from the eastern Donbas region means \"everything will be over\", a reference to Russia's maximalist demand that Moscow <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78v5dj3x39o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">secure full control of the industrial area</a> in any peace agreement. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Moscow currently controls about 75% of the Donetsk region, and some 99% of the neighbouring Luhansk. The two regions are known collectively as Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its fate has been a major obstacle throughout negotiations, with Russia consistently unwilling to compromise on its aim to seize full control of Donbas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the address, Zelensky thanked leaders that have supported Ukraine, but said that \"intentions must become security guarantees, and therefore - be ratified\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following talks between Zelensky and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Florida earlier this week, the Ukrainian leader said Washington had offered <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c36z615y443o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">security guarantees for 15 years</a> - but a time frame for their implementation is not yet clear.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Signatures under weak agreements only fuel war,\" Zelensky said in his address. \"Either the world stops Russia's war, or Russia drags the world into its war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By comparison, Putin's New Year address was much shorter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the war in Ukraine, which Moscow describes as a \"special military operation\", Putin said: \"We strive to bring joy and warmth through our care for those in need of support and, of course, to stand by our heroes – the participants in the special military operation – in both word and deed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year message to praise the \"invincible alliance\" between Pyongyang and Moscow, while praising soldiers who are fighting in \"alien lands\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Korea has sent thousands of troops to aid Russia in its invasion, along with missiles and long-range weapons, South Korean officials have said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 600 of those soldiers have died, according to South Korean estimates. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ad12/live/90346320-e6ca-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Russian Defence Ministry A Russian defence ministry official sits in front of a large screen which shows a map, marked with the the alleged flight paths of the drones Russia says Ukraine launched at one of Putin's residences.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Russian Defence Ministry</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russia's defence ministry released a map which it claimed showed the path of the drones launched by Ukraine</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has expressed a desire for peace negotiations to resume and accelerate this month with the involvement of both US and European officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron said European states and allies who are due to meet in Paris on 6 January \"will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, Trump's advisers held talks with Zelensky and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US special envoy Steve Witkoff said they discussed \"strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But any deal will ultimately need Russian buy-in, which does not seem forthcoming -

His pitch to lead the most expensive US city included big changes, such as universal childcare, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the mayor is likely to encounter several challenges in trying to deliver on these promises, and he'll need to keep on board other important political stakeholders - beginning on his first full day in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He'll put all of his political and other might behind getting these things accomplished,\" said Patrick Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University. But, he said, New York City is \"a big place, it's a complicated place, and so, all bets are off about whether these things can happen or not\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">1.

For instance, if he wants to freeze rents for subsidised housing, he can appoint people aligned with this policy on the city's rent control board.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But finding the funding to make other goals a reality when the state and city face budget shortfalls will prove complicated, government experts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to provide free bus service and free child care, these kinds of things cost money,\" said Robert Shapiro, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. \"The big roadblock for the things he'd like to do are the state of the New York, the financial capacity of the state and the political willingness of the governor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has said some funding would come from new taxes. He believes taxes on the wealthy could raise as much as $9bn (£6.6bn), with pledges to raise the corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mamdani needs the support of the state government to make tax changes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The more moderate Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed him in the race last year as well as some of his affordability goals. But Hochul, who is making her own political calculations as she runs for re-election this year, has already indicated she may not support Mamdani's broader tax plan. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">2.

The two men frequently smiled at each other and shared praise, with Trump telling Mamdani he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the two politicians' diametrically opposed policy positions could lead to conflict as Mamdani takes over City Hall. Immigration may be a point of tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, New York has not been a target of Trump's efforts to send in National Guard troops, as he has done in Democratic-led cities across the US in response to anti-immigration protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Trump administration did ramp up immigration raids in New York as part of its enforcement efforts in several cities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor pledged in his victory speech that New York would \"remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and  ... led by an immigrant\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">3.

The now-mayor reached out to his opponents in the business world to hear their concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani pledged to meet with leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who later said he would offer his help if Mamdani was elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani also met with real estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who described him as \"personable\" and \"smart\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Gural and others in the business community continue to express their concerns that the 34-year-old lacks the experience to lead the nation's largest city - and that his plans to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy people will drive some of them to leave New York. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Egan said it remains to be seen whether a \"spirit of cooperation\" will persist between business leaders and Mamdani as he forges ahead with an agenda that is ideologically at odds with some of their goals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any mayor of New York needs cooperation from business leaders, and in particular finance and real estate that play big roles here in New York City,\" he said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">4. Addressing public safety</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani announces a new public safety plan in campaign ad</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As mayor, Mamdani will face a perennial challenge for New York City leaders, tackling crime and maintaining a sense of safety for New Yorkers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many big cities, New York saw an uptick in crime during the Covid pandemic, though in 2025, the rate of homocides and shootings in the city fell to a near-record low. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This decline in crime gives Mamdani \"a bit of wiggle room to think creatively\" about public safety in New York, including improving social services and support, Mr Egan said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has promised to create a Department of Community Safety that would invest in mental health programmes and crisis response as well as deploy outreach workers to subway stations across the city.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' administration also sent outreach workers to subway stations and established other housing and mental health programmes. But some experts and community leaders say those efforts failed to adequately address homelessness and mental health crises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson, a counselor to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said he and others will judge Mamdani first and foremost on how the city is policed, and how shoplifting and quality of life crimes are handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani won over some business leaders and members of the public with his decision to ask Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who served in Adams' administration, to stay on as police chief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Public safety is really kind of the prerequisite for success or failure,\" Mr Wolfson previously told the BBC. \"I think if people feel safe here, they can tolerate an awful lot of other challenges. And if they don't, then there's not a lot of other challenges that they will be willing to tolerate.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It made its manufacturer, the small South Korean label CosRX, go global. It is now owned by Amorepacific, the country's biggest cosmetics company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rapid spread of that sticky serum tells you just how wildly successful K-beauty has become. Fuelled by viral content and trends, it is one of the biggest industries in South Korea, where the pressure to look almost flawless has always been huge in a highly competitive society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The domestic market alone was valued at about $13bn (£9.6bn) in 2024, with sales of some products expected to grow at double-digit rates. And the rest of the world is just as obsessed with K-beauty - which is perhaps unsurprising given it's part of the Hallyu, or Korean Wave, which has made K-Pop and K-dramas a global phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">K-beauty brands now occupy whole sections at global retailers - from Sephora to Boots to Walmart. In the first half of 2025, South Korea overtook France, the birthplace of modern cosmetics, to become the world's second-largest exporter of beauty products, after the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Search for \"Korean skincare\" on TikTok, Instagram or YouTube and you'll be met with a deluge of content from influencers, some of whom have hundreds of millions of followers. They dissect ingredient lists, film unboxings and record \"Get Ready With Me\" videos built around ideas such as \"glass skin\", sheet masks and, of course, snail mucin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are so many products and brands, and a lot of times you're exposed to millions of them as a consumer - it's highly saturated and competitive,\" said Liah Yoo, a beauty influencer and founder of the US-based K-beauty brand Krave Beauty.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The formula behind the rise  </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of K-beauty's rise is a relentless pace of innovation. New formulations appear every few months, often designed to spark the next online obsession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ten-step skincare routines, overnight \"water sleeping masks\" and headline-grabbing ingredients such as salmon sperm were once viewed as niche or unappealing. Today, many are staples in bathroom cabinets from London to Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media has been central to this shift. Products launched in Seoul are on TikTok and Instagram feeds in the US, UK, India and Australia instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are however growing concerns about the social impact of beauty ideals, particularly on young people. Experts warn that constant exposure to skincare content online can fuel anxiety and excessive spending.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c253/live/b71fce30-e809-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Sulwhasoo brand global ambassador, Yoona of girl group Girls' Generation poses for a photocall for the AMORE PACIFIC 'Sulwhasoo' holistic night party on April 14, 2025 in Seoul,\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">K-pop star Yoona promoting one of South Korea's best-known beauty brands     </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are fully aware that excessive use or misuse of social media can lead to backlash,\" said Kim Seung-hwan, Amorepacific's chief executive, adding that brands must strike a careful balance in how they use online platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The challenge will only grow as the industry expands to include Western multinationals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">L'Oréal acquired a South Korean conglomerate which included the brand Dr.G in late 2024, saying the deal would help meet rising demand for effective yet affordable K-beauty products.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other global firms are increasingly incorporating popular ingredients associated with Korean brands such as centella asiatica and rice water into their own lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many of South Korea's large beauty brands are part of the country's powerful conglomerates, or chaebols. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amorepacific accounts for roughly half of the domestic market. Its portfolio ranges from premium brands such as Sulwhasoo to global mass-market names like Laneige, environmentally focused labels such as Innisfree, and fast-growing independent brands. But even as a chaebol, Amorepacific says it looks to smaller independent brands for fresh ideas.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend Korean beauty event in New York, October 23, 2025.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend a Korean beauty event organised by Amorepacific and Sephora in New York</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Through the founder and the CosRX team, we were able to learn their approach to formula innovation and how to respond more quickly to consumer needs,\" Mr Kim from Amorepacific said. \"These lessons have since been integrated into our wider organisation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Amorepacific sold about $6.2bn of products.

The BBC visited a sprawling Amorepacific factory outside South Korea's capital Seoul, where a handful of workers oversaw fully automated production lines bottling Laneige's Water Sleeping Mask and CosRX's Vitamin C 23 Serum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speed, however, comes at a cost. Intense competition has contributed to thin profit margins and high rates of business failures.

as is the bar's safety record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify has been examining videos taken by survivors and onlookers and speaking to fire safety experts to find clues about what went wrong.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bottles with sparklers held in the air</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two striking images shared widely online show people carrying champagne bottles with lit sparklers above their heads, with a crowd around them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One image shows flames starting to gather on the ceiling above people holding five of these bottles aloft.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second image is a closer-up angle, showing a person wearing a crash helmet and holding a bottle with a lit sparkler, sitting on the shoulders of another person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The sparks from this bottle appear to be closer to the ceiling.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">​​BBC Verify determined these images were taken after midnight on 1 January by confirming there were not earlier versions and matched them against public photos of Le Constellation - using details including the bar design and distinctive pipework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there was no evidence the images had been ​​manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other videos we verified from the night of the fire, some people in the bar can be seen filming the flames as loud club music thumps in the background. In one video, some people start to hurry for an exit stairwell while shouting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Béatrice Pilloud, the attorney-general of the Valais region, said everything led investigators to believe the fire had started from sparklers attached to bottles of champagne that were \"moved too close to the ceiling\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Questions about foam padding on ceiling</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another focus is on foam-like padding on the bar's ceiling and whether it was compliant with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two fire safety experts told BBC Verify that the materials visible in photos and videos of Le Constellation appeared to show \"egg box foam\", a type of sound-absorbing material made from polyurethane (PU).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the photo of the bottles being held up, flames are visible on a part of the ceiling with a foam-like covering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">PU foam is often treated with fire-retardant before being installed as a noise dampener in factories and entertainment venues. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But untreated, it can be highly flammable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once ignited, polyurethane acoustic foam can exhibit rapid flame spread across its high-surface-area profile and produce dense, toxic smoke, significantly accelerating fire growth and reducing available escape time,\" said Dr Peter Wilkinson of Loughborough University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Edwin Galea, from the University of Greenwich, said the effectiveness of retardant treatment on PU foam can wear off over time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Swiss authorities say they cannot confirm what type of foam-padding was used in the bar and whether or not it complied with safety standards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c8xdxvj2qjdt\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">In Friday's press conference</a>, officials talked about a \"flashover\" happening in the bar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Professor Galea explained this is what happens when hot gases rise to the ceiling, reach a critical temperature and then ignite the room near instantaneously.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Michael Klippel, a fire safety expert at ETH Zurich University, \"survival after flashover is very unlikely\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authority responsible for overseeing fire safety inspections in Crans-Montana is the Office Cantonal du Feu (OCF) of the Canton of Valais. The inspections are carried out by local officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities said in a press conference that inspections on a building the size of Le Constellation should have been carried out each year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has contacted the OCF to request access to previous inspection documents.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Exit routes from the bar</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say they will also focus on exit routes at the bar, which sits across two levels - a ground floor and a basement. The fire is thought to have started in the basement, where the two images referred to above were taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos filmed as the fire took hold show people trying to extinguish the flames before trying to get out of the basement up a narrow set of stairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Galea said staircase exits can be fatal bottlenecks with people tripping and getting trampled.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\"></figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said even if there were other fire exits, panicked people in unfamiliar spaces were more likely to go out the way they came in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials also confirmed there was more than one exit from the building, but added they were \"not currently able to say\" whether the emergency exit was open or closed at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Valais state councillor Stéphane Ganzer said: \"There is not just one door, even though at the time of the fire, it seems that most people left through the main entrance. But this building is a public place. It was obviously equipped with an emergency exit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pilloud told journalists that the two French managers of the bar had been interviewed as well as people who escaped the fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the bar's owners reportedly told local media the establishment had been inspected three times in the past ten years and that everything had been done according to regulations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Sparklers used before</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigators say they have also been analysing other videos of the venue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One video we found shows sparklers attached to bottles being used inside the bar as far back as 2024. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"YouTube An image taken from a YouTube video posted in 2024 which shows someone holding a bottle with a lit sparkler attached in the air in Le Constellation bar. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">YouTube</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A still image from a YouTube video posted in 2024 showing someone holding a bottle with a sparkler in Le Constellation bar. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It shows women dressed in distinctive crash helmets carrying the bottles and pyrotechnics to customers, before detaching them and pouring drinks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The footage was uploaded to YouTube in May 2024 by the account @ConstellationCransMontana, though we can't be certain when it was filmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ed Habershon / BBC A head and shoulders image of a smiling Christy Chitengu.

Also I would have had to physically leave South Africa to get a Zimbabwean passport and without any documents to leave the country, I wouldn't be allowed back in.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has large numbers of undocumented migrants and the authorities and local vigilante groups have been trying to crack down on irregular migration for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked whether giving stateless children citizenship could be seen as a reward to undocumented migrants who give birth in South Africa, Christy disagrees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think citizenship is not a reward. It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being. I think if we look at it through that lens, we realise that there's nothing that we lose by recognising a child who would otherwise not be able to go to primary school or receive healthcare.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6f5f/live/2949eb10-df60-11f0-a7ad-b72dffdf9dfd.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A South African birth certificate can be seen through a magnifying glass.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In South Africa, an estimated 10,000 people are stateless </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On several occasions, the BBC contacted the home affairs department, which handles immigration issues in South Africa, to find out how it is tackling the issue of statelessness but got no reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Statelessness is not just an issue here, it is a huge global problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's an estimated 4.5 million stateless people around the world. Some say the figure could even be as high as 15 million.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts believe tackling the problem requires policy changes, including allowing refugees to register their children where they're born, and giving mothers the right to pass their nationality to their children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For us statelessness is not just a legal issue, it's a matter that involves the right to development,\" says Jesus Perez Sanchez who works for the UNHCR.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That person that's affected by statelessness will not be able to contribute fully to that country that is hosting.

Walking the length of Manhattan to show New Yorkers they \"deserve a mayor that they can see, they can hear, they can even yell at\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those social media videos helped propel Zohran Mamdani and his left-wing policies to a surprise win in New York City's mayoral primary, and then to victory in the November election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The democratic socialist, 34, engaged New Yorkers - particularly young voters who spend much of their time \"doom-scrolling\" – by using social media to build an image of someone who is authentic and joyful, experts told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, after he was sworn in as mayor on 1 January, his next challenge will be keeping those same supporters engaged and maintaining the momentum in office.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After becoming the first New York mayor to take the oath of office with his hand on a Quran, Mamdani told thousands gathered to watch his inauguration ceremony in freezing weather that he would represent everyone in the city.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I do not stand alone. I stand alongside you,\" he said, adding: \"I promise you this: If you are a New Yorker, I am your mayor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About three-quarters of New York City voters under the age of 30 voted for Mamdani, according to an Associated Press voter poll.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's robust social media strategy engaged these voters by delivering an image of a political candidate that young people - frustrated with older, more established candidates - craved, Jane Hall, a communications professor at American University who studies politics and the media, told the BBC after Mamdani's election victory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A candidate does not have to be young to connect with young voters, Hall said, \"but I think you have to be seen as being authentic and speaking to what people care about in a way that is hip and makes people want to be on the bandwagon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jack Bratich, a journalism professor at Rutgers University who studies political culture and social media, said Mamdani had shown he is able to combine a lightheartedness with serious conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That sense of fun stands in contrast to some of the negativity that President Donald Trump has leaned into on social media, Jennifer Stromer-Galley, who teaches communications, political science, and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, told the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab04/live/78cee5c0-e715-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media in the Oval Office\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The pair had a warm first meeting at the White House in November</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqd42gl0qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">unexpectedly friendly first meeting</a> in November between the two politicians, where they said they agreed on a number of issues facing New York City, such as the affordability crisis, the pair locked horns during the mayoral race. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump painted Mamdani as an extremist \"lunatic\", threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won, and said he would have him arrested if he stood in the way of immigration enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On election night, Mamdani snapped back in his victory speech, telling the president \"to get to any of us, you will have to get through all of us\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That comment prompted a raucous cheer from his supporters at the time, but experts say the reality of governing may mean engaging with the Trump administration in a pragmatic way. That warm meeting in November may have been an early sign that Mamdani is willing to do so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How he works with the White House - and the kind of relationship he cultivates with the president - could prove crucial for implementing his agenda.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While it may be easy to promise \"fast, sweeping change\" in campaign videos, things become much more difficult when it comes to actually \"governing under a hostile administration\", said Ioana Literat, a Columbia University communications professor who studies youth online political socialisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If his [social media] content doesn't reckon honestly with those constraints, the same young people who made him go viral can just as quickly turn that energy into disillusionment or backlash,\" she said.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zohran Mamdani: From immigrant roots to mayor of New York City</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To succeed in office Mamdani will need to keep his supporters engaged with day-to-day governing - and that is not as thrilling as a high-stakes political race, Jonathan Nagler, co-director of NYU's Center for Social Media and Politics, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's easy to mobilise people to oppose Trump. They already disagree with Trump on so many things, if we're talking about New York City voters,\" Nagler said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What's much harder to do is to go on social media and say: \"Hey, the New York City Council is in my way. I need you to get riled up about convincing the New York City Council to do something\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nagler added that it could be a challenge to educate some of those voters about how city government works.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Like all election campaigns, the transition to governance via media is tricky,\" Rutgers Prof Bratich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One strategy for keeping the momentum of his campaign could be to turn his captive social media followers into active grassroots organisers. After all, social media \"was the front door into a huge field operation and youth volunteer corps\" for the mayor-elect, Braitch said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's posts during the campaign consistently directed followers toward protests, canvassing events, registration drives, and other forms of active participation - ultimately producing more than 100,000 volunteers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if his administration stumbles and the feeds keep promising more than he can deliver, it could harden a sense among young voters that 'even the internet's mayor couldn't change anything,'\" Literat said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That broader reputational risk is part of what makes his governing-era social media so consequential,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's transition team did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is at least one major sign that that the grassroots momentum surrounding Mamdani will continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, his allies announced a new advocacy group that aims to use his deep well of volunteers to raise funds for his agenda. The nonprofit, Our Time for an Affordable NYC, was founded by Mamdani volunteers and members of the Democratic Socialists of New York.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Our Time is legally separate from Mamdani and his transition team, the group says it is focused on pushing forward the mayor-elect's affordability agenda through \"door-knocking, phone-banking, communicating, and organising at the neighbourhood, city, and state level\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's swearing-in ceremony on Thursday took place inside the original City Hall subway station, which is now abandoned for regular transit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,\" he said. \"I cannot wait to see everyone tomorrow as we begin our term.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Knowing their benefits would expire, the family stockpiled the drug to survive the first few months of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be like paying two mortgage payments,\" she said of the new monthly price for healthcare. \"We can't pay $30,000 for insurance a year.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Martin and her family are not the only ones facing this conundrum. Millions of Americans will see their healthcare bills skyrocket when these subsidies, which were provided through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare,  expire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some members of Congress on both sides of the aisle attempted to extend these subsidies into 2026, but Washington was gridlocked. A vote in the new year could offer hope, but until then, many like Ms Martin will have to live without insurance or see their bills steeply increase.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 24 million Americans buy health insurance through the ACA marketplace, and the majority were used to receiving tax credits to lower the monthly price.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those tax credits, also referred to as subsidies, were first introduced through former President Barack Obama's ACA in 2014. They were then expanded during Covid. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fight to extend the subsidies became the centre of the longest government shutdown in US history, which went on for more than 40 days earlier this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats wanted to force Republicans to extend the subsidies for an additional three years, which would cost $35bn per year. Republicans did not want the government to foot the bill for another three years of subsidies without spending cuts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c891nvwvg2zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">weeks-long shutdown</a> - which left millions without essential government services - ended when a group of Democratic senators agreed to reopen the government, if Republicans in the Senate agreed to vote on extending the subsidies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that vote still hasn't happened yet, despite efforts from Democrats and four Republicans to put the issue to Congress before the subsidies expired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am pissed for the American people,\" New York Congressman Mike Lawler, a Republican who pushed to save the subsidies, said. \"Everybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to their constituents. You know what is funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without the subsidies, the monthly cost of healthcare could rise by 114% on average, according to health research non-profit KFF.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12d4/live/d421b9f0-e5a5-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Adrienne Martin and Stephanie Petersen</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maddie Bannister is among the Americans bracing for that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The California mother, who just had her second child, was paying $124 a month for her family of three in 2025. Now, with a new baby and no ACA subsidies, she is preparing to pay $908 a month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So many people are going to choose to be uninsured because it's cheaper to pay a penalty for being uninsured than it is to have healthcare,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ms Bannister's family, the increased cost of healthcare means putting off other spending: \"We were saving for a home, and saving money for that is going to take way longer if we have to spend $11,000 a year on healthcare that we barely use.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Ms Bannister is stomaching her new bill, and Ms Martin is going without healthcare, others are resorting to different government programmes to get their coverage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years, Stephanie Petersen used Medicaid - a healthcare program for lower-income Americans - to get healthcare coverage. Just recently, she was able to switch and get her coverage through the ACA - a welcome change for the 38-year-old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because her health care is skyrocketing from $75 to $580 a month, she is returning to Medicaid coverage in the New Year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm trying to stay optimistic but the way things have been going, I'm not hopeful,\" the Illinois resident said. \"Everyone should have affordable, good healthcare, and not have to jump through all these hoops.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A vote on the three-year extension of the ACA subsidies is now expected the week of 5 January when Congress returns to Washington. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until then, Ms Martin will be one of the more than 27 million Americans without health insurance in 2026. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A number that is likely to grow, experts warn, as healthcare costs increase. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not low-income people, we make decent money, but we can't afford $30,000 a year for insurance, that's crazy,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've done everything we're supposed to do, we've worked our whole lives, we work hard, and we just get screwed.

But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine.

Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU.

Black-browed albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird-scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird-scaring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird-scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird-scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird-scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"
