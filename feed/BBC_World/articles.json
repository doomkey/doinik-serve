Trump</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has given her Nobel Peace Prize medal to President Donald Trump during a meeting at the White House, saying it was a recognition of his commitment to her country's freedom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think today is a historic day for us Venezuelans,\" she said after meeting Trump in person for the first time, weeks after US forces seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas and charged him in a drug-trafficking case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said on social media that the move was \"a wonderful gesture of mutual respect\", but the Nobel committee has said the prize itself was not transferable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, despite her movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has instead been dealing with the acting head of state in Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's former vice-president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he said meeting Machado was a \"great honor\", calling her a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After leaving the White House, Machado spoke to supporters gathered at the gates outside, telling them in Spanish, according to the Associated Press: \"We can count on President Trump.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I presented the president of the United States the medal of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" Machado later told journalists in English, calling it \"a

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump, who often speaks about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, had expressed displeasure when it was given to Machado and she decided to accept the honour last year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has reached out to the White House for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado said last week that she would share it with Trump, but the committee later clarified that it was not transferable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others,\" it said in a statement last week. \"The decision is final and stands for all time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked for a reaction to Machado's remarks, the committee directed the BBC to their previous statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before the White House meeting on Thursday, the Nobel Peace Center posted on X that \"a medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In her remarks, Machado described how the Marquis de Lafayette, who fought in America's Revolutionary War, gave a medal bearing the likeness of George Washington to Simon Bolivar, one of the founding fathers of modern Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gift was \"a sign of the brotherhood\" between her country and the US \"in their fight for freedom against tyranny,\" Machado said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And 200 years in history, the people of Bolivar are giving back to the heir of Washington a medal - in this case a medal of the Nobel Peace Prize - as a recognition for his unique commitment with our freedom,\" she said.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado also visited Congress to meet US senators during her visit to Washington, where her remarks to reporters were drowned out by supporters chanting \"María, presidente\" and waving Venezuelan flags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had been expected to use her time with Trump to try to persuade him that backing Rodríguez's interim government was a mistake, and that her opposition coalition should be in charge of this transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters as the meeting was under way on Thursday that Machado is \"a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela\" and that Trump \"was looking forward to this meeting and expecting a frank and positive discussion\" about the current realities of life in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously described Machado as a \"freedom fighter\", but rejected the notion of appointing her to lead Venezuela after Maduro's removal, arguing that she lacks sufficient domestic support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Freddy Guevara, co-founder of the opposition Venezuelan party Voluntad Popular  and a former political prisoner of Maduro now living in exile, told the BBC he didn't think Machado was \"looking for endorsement\" in giving Trump the prize or that it was a \"tactic so Trump can appoint her\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think this is not a personal goal. I think that María Corina Machado understands the importance, and she believes that this is the right thing to do for the freedom of Venezuela,\" Guevara said, speaking on Radio 4's Today programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the focus of the opposition was on securing democratic elections for the country. \"What we are aiming is to have a democratic transition in which the people of Venezuela are the ones that will decide through their votes who is the one that is going to govern us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Maduro was seized on 3 January, the Trump administration has moved quickly to remake Venezuela's oil sector, which had been under US sanctions. On Wednesday an American official said the US had completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil, valued at $500m (£373m).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oil tankers suspected of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan oil have also been seized by the US, with US forces saying they had boarded <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4qdnj5vl9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a sixth tanker on Thursday</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guevara said he didn't think the US's actions just related to oil, \"however, we are not naive, and we understand the importance of development and oil for them [the US]. But we believe that both things can work at the same time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Venezuelan government envoy is expected to travel to Washington on Thursday to meet US officials and take initial steps toward reopening the country's embassy, the New York Times reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emissary is reported to be a close ally and friend of Rodríguez, who has been described as \"extremely co-operative\" by the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rodríguez delivered the annual Message to the Nation speech in Caracas on Thursday, in which she said she was willing to attend meetings in Washington as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If I ever have to go to Washington as acting president, I will do so standing tall, walking, and not crawling,\" she said, calling on the country to \"not be afraid of diplomacy\" with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Rodríguez also spoke by phone on Wednesday, with Trump later describing his counterpart on social media as \"a terrific person\".  Rodríguez, meanwhile, described the call as \"productive and courteous\" and characterised by \"mutual respect.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"do-you-have-a-question-about-trump's-first-year-back-in-office?\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Do you have a question about Trump's first year back in office? </i><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/send/u227284793\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"click-here\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Click here</i></a><i id=\"or-use-the-form-below.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> or use the form below.</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c861yyqxg4do\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a decisive victory</a> . </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-koh-ewe\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Koh Ewe</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

A construction worker in Iran typically earns less than $100 a month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some cases, hospital staff have phoned the relatives of the dead to give them an advance warning to come and get the bodies before security forces can extort any funds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has been told about a<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>woman<b id=\"-\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> -</b> who we are not identifying for her safety - who did not know her husband was killed until she received a phone call on 9 January on his phone from hospital staff. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They told her she should quickly come and collect his body before security forces arrived and demanded payment for its release. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian was told about this situation by a London-based relative, who has spoken to her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The woman<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>then took her two children to the hospital to find her husband's body.  She put it in the back of a pickup truck, and drove for seven hours to their hometown in western Iran to bury him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I rode in the back of the pickup truck, crying over his body for seven hours while my children sat in the front seat,\" she told her London relative. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has also received reports that officials at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra mortuary are telling families that if they claim their child was a member of the Basij paramilitary force and was killed by protesters, the body will be released without charge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family member told the BBC in a message: \"We were asked to participate in a pro-government rally and portray the body as that of a martyr. We did not agree to this.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another case in Tehran, a source told BBC Persian that several families broke into a mortuary to retrieve bodies out of fear they would be taken away by the authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Several families, fearing that the authorities might keep the bodies or bury them without their knowledge, broke open the morgue door and pulled the bodies out of  ambulances,\" the source told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The families then guarded the bodies for several hours on the ground in the hospital courtyard to prevent them from being taken away until they could find private ambulances to transport them, the source said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An internet and communications blackout has made it difficult to get a full picture of what is happening on the ground. International human-rights groups have no direct access to the country and, along with other international news organisations, the BBC is not allowed by the Iranian government to report on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demonstrations began in the capital, Tehran, on 29 December, following a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency against the dollar. As the protests reached dozens of other towns and cities, they turned against Iran's clerical rulers and security forces launched a violent crackdown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,435 protesters have been killed since the unrest began, as well as 13 children and 153 people affiliated with the security forces or government. It reports that another 18,470 protesters have been arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, arrests have continued across the country. Security forces and Revolutionary Guard intelligence units have detained activists, lawyers, and ordinary citizens. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

and what that means for sea-level rise.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like before you had a grainy pixel film camera, and now you've got a properly zoomed-in digital image of what's really going on,\" lead author Dr Helen Ockenden, a researcher at the University of Grenoble-Alpes, told BBC News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thanks to satellites, scientists have a good understanding of Antarctica's icy surface – but what lies beneath has remained more of a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In fact, more is known about the surface of some planets in our Solar System than much of Antarctica's \"underbelly\" – the topography beneath the ice sheet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But researchers now have what they believe to be the most complete, detailed map of that underbelly ever made.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm just so excited to look at that and just see the whole bed of Antarctica at once,\" said Prof Robert Bingham, a glaciologist at the University of Edinburgh who co-authored the study. \"I think that's amazing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Traditional measurements from the ground or air have used radar to \"see\" beneath the ice - which is up to three miles (4.8km) thick in places - often along individual survey lines or tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But these tracks could be tens of kilometres apart - leaving scientists to fill in the gaps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“If you imagined the Scottish Highlands or the European Alps were covered by ice and the only way to understand their shape was the occasional flight several kilometres apart, there's no way that you would see all these sharp mountains and valleys that we know to be there,” said Bingham.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So the researchers used a new approach, combining their knowledge of the ice surface from satellites and their understanding of how the ice moves from physics - and checking them against those previous tracks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“It’s a little bit like if you're kayaking in a river, and there's rocks underneath the water, sometimes there's eddies in the surface, which can tell you about the rocks under the water,” explained Ockenden. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“And ice obviously flows very differently to water, but still, when the ice is flowing over a ridge or a hill in the bedrock […] that manifests in the topography of the surface, but also in the velocity as well.”</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While we knew about Antarctica's major mountain ranges, the scientists' new approach has revealed tens of thousands of previously undiscovered hills and ridges, as well as greater details around some of those mountains and canyons buried under the ice.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's just really super interesting to look at all these new landscapes and see what's there,\" said Ockenden.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like when you see a map of topography on Mars for the first time, and you're like, 'whoa, this is so interesting, this looks a bit like Scotland,' or 'this looks like nothing I've ever seen before'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One intriguing discovery is a deep channel incised in Antarctica's bed in an area called the Maud Subglacial Basin. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The channel is on average 50m deep, 6km wide and runs for nearly 400km (about 250 miles) - roughly the distance from London to Newcastle as the crow flies.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers’ new map is unlikely to be the final one. It relies on assumptions about exactly how ice flows which, like any method, comes with uncertainties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And much remains to be discovered about the rocks and sediments that lie beneath the ice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other researchers agree that, combined with further surveys from the ground, air and space, the maps are a valuable step forward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a really useful product,\" said Dr Peter Fretwell, senior scientist at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, who was not involved in the new study but has been extensively involved in previous mapping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It gives us an opportunity to fill in the gaps between those surveys,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more detailed understanding of all of the ridges, hills, mountains and channels could improve computer models of how Antarctica might change in future, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That is because these landforms and features ultimately shape how fast the glaciers above move, and how quickly they can retreat in <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w15nggj58o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a warming climate</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that is important because the future speed of melting in Antarctica is widely considered to be one of the biggest unknowns in climate science.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“[This study gives] us a better picture of what's going to happen in the future and how quickly ice in Antarctica will contribute to global sea-level rise,” agreed Fretwell. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study is published in the academic journal, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady2532\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Science</a>.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It airs on Fox in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an affidavit supporting his arrest warrant, authorities claim the boys referred to Busfield as \"Uncle Tim\" and alleged that he \"would tickle them on the stomach and legs\". Both boys told authorities they were touched inappropriately for years, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the boys alleged that Busfield touched his private areas, according to court documents. The boy told authorities that the alleged inappropriate touching started when he was 7 years old and he was scared to speak out because he \"feared\" that Busfield would \"get mad at him\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The documents state that the boy had suffered nightmares and was having troubles wetting the bed since the alleged encounters. He has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety, authorities say in the court documents. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before he turned himself in, Busfield appeared in a video provided to TMZ saying that he was contacted on Friday night about getting a lawyer. The next day he drove 2,000 miles (3,200 km) to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to surrender to authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies,\" he said in the video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His lawyer says the case stems from wanting revenge. Busfield told authorities that the boys' mother had threatened revenge when they were replaced on the series, the arrest affidavit states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As reflected in the criminal complaint, after her son was terminated from the show, the boy's mother vowed to 'get her revenge against Timothy Busfield.' What followed appears to be a calculated effort to construct a case, driven by animus not fact, despite prior investigations finding no evidence of wrongdoing,\" Stein said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stein added that an investigation opened by Warner Bros about the allegations was closed after they could not find \"corroborating evidence that Mr Busfield engaged in inappropriate conduct or that he was ever alone\" with the boys. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents show that after authorities got a warrant for his arrest, another accusation surfaced alleging Busfield kissed and groped a 16-year-old girl.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors noted the new allegation in a motion asking that a judge keep Busfield from being released from jail immediately, alleging the actor has a \"documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In that court document, prosecutors said the girl's father had come forward on Tuesday with allegations that the teen had been sexually abused by Busfield in California \"several years ago\" at the B-Street Theatre, which the actor co-founded in Sacramento.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The father alleged to authorities that the encounter happened when the girl was auditioning at the theatre and the actor allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually, the court document states. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents state that the father alleged that the actor \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement\" and agreed to go to therapy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield's lawyer told the BBC that the actor denies all the allegations and \"maintains that they are completely false\". When asked about the additional accusation surfacing, Stein said Busfield had volunteered to do a polygraph test and had passed it. The lawyer did not provide further details on the test. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Busfield has previously been accused of sexual assault by two women in the 1990s and in 2012, which prosecutors pointed to in court documents. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cleaning Lady producer Warner Bros Television and Fox said that they were aware of the charges against Busfield and would work with law enforcement. They told the Los Angeles Times that they prioritise the health and safety of their cast and crew.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for Busfield's wife Melissa Gilbert, who starred in the series Little House on the Prairie, told the BBC that she would not make public statements and pushed back against fake comments circulating online that claim to have come from her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She is honoring the request of Tim's lawyers not to speak publicly while the legal process unfolds,\" her publicist Ame Van Iden said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The authorities are yet to comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the 2021 election, in which he garnered 35% of the vote, Wine was confined to his home for several days by security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During Thursday's vote, voting was delayed by up to four hours in many polling stations around the country as ballot boxes were slow to arrive and biometric machines, used to verify voters' identity, did not work properly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have linked the problems to the network outage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although there are other six candidates, the presidential poll is essentially a two-horse race between Museveni and Wine, but given the president has won the six previous elections, analysts say he is likely to further extend his time in power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wine, who says he represents the youth in a country where most of the population is aged under 30, has promised to tackle corruption and impose sweeping reforms, while Museveni argues he is the sole guarantor of stability and progress in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The campaign period was marred by the disruption of opposition activities - security forces have been accused of assaulting and detaining Wine's supporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke dismissed these complaints, accusing opposition supporters of being disruptive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Internet access was suspended on Tuesday, with Uganda's Communications Commission saying the blackout was necessary to prevent misinformation, fraud and the incitement of violence - a move condemned by the UN human rights office as \"deeply worrying\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, had called on his supporters to protest, if Thursday's election results were manipulated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, as of Friday morning, there have been no signs of any demonstrations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Museveni victory would extend the former rebel leader's four-decade grip on power. He is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, though he denies grooming him for the role.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The final presidential result are expected be announced by 16:00 local time (13:00 GMT) on Saturday, according to the electoral commission. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-sammy-awami-in-kampala\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting-by-sammy-awami-in-kampala\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting by Sammy Awami in Kampala</b></i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e463/live/2c1ff440-f281-11f0-a10c-399abdbf6459.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A woman wipes her tears while hugging a young girl, as a picture of a soldier can be seen in the background\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Some 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in Venezuela</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

More than half of those have been placed significantly deeper inside the Strip than the line marked on maps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson said it rejected \"all claims that the Yellow Line has been moved or its crossing by IDF troops\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The IDF is operating to visually mark the Yellow Line in accordance with the conditions on the ground and the ongoing operational situational assessment,\" they added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysis of satellite images up to 11 January suggests some sections of the Yellow Line - which the head of Israel's military described as a \"new border line\" - also remain unmarked on the ground more than three months since the ceasefire began.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest satellite images reviewed by BBC Verify show that blocks have not been placed along roughly 10km (six miles) of territory - leaving some people in Gaza struggling to know where the beginning of what the IDF calls a \"dangerous combat zone\" is.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, one 23-year-old man near Khan Younis - whom the BBC is not naming for his own safety - said Israeli troops suddenly moved blocks near him beyond the mapped line, leaving him \"trapped\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are now living inside the Yellow Line, [but] behind the yellow blocks, with no idea what our fate will be,\" he said. \"The atmosphere at night is terrifying. We hear shells exploding, soldiers advancing, gunfire, and drones buzzing overhead without pause. We are also being shot at directly.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security expert from King's College London, has called the movement of the blocks a \"tool for territorial engineering\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By keeping the legal line on the map and the physical blocks hundreds of metres apart, Israel preserves the ability to shift where Gazans may live, move and farm without ever formally announcing a change of border,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Efraim Inbar - president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security - suggested that the mapped line may not account for natural barriers to the markers and that IDF engineers may be putting the blocks where they \"find it easier to place\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Series of deadly incidents around the Yellow Line</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Katz's warning in October, troops have shot at people crossing the Yellow Line on at least 69 occasions, an analysis of IDF Telegram posts and statements to the BBC showed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 19 December, the IDF conducted a strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the al-Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City - some 330m inside the Palestinian side of the line, according to the IDF maps - but just metres from a yellow block that was moved there. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses said it happened while a wedding was taking place right by the school building. Five people, including children, were killed in the blast, Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF statement relating to that day said they fired at \"suspicious individuals\" west of the Yellow Line, adding that the incident remained under review and that it \"regrets any harm to uninvolved individuals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another deadly incident, 17-year-old Zaher Nasser Shamiya was killed near yellow blocks in Jabalia camp in northern Gaza. His father said IDF troops fired at him before running him over with a tank on 10 December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The tank turned his body into pieces… it came into the safe area [west of the Yellow Line] and ran over him,\" he said. BBC Verify has approached the IDF for comment on the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in November, local media reported that two children - aged eight and 10 or 11 - were killed by Israeli forces. Their uncle said that the pair <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8e97kl240lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">had been gathering firewood for their disabled father</a> when they were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Addressing the deaths, an IDF statement said it had eliminated two suspects who crossed the Yellow Line, conducted suspicious activities on the ground, and approached IDF troops. It did not offer details on how the pair were identified as suspects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson accused Hamas fighters of firing on troops six times \"beyond the Yellow Line\" over the past week, in a statement to BBC Verify.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Demolitions and fortification</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Israel agreed to withdraw its forces behind the Yellow Line under October's ceasefire deal, videos and satellite images seen by BBC Verify have repeatedly shown IDF vehicles operating beyond the mapped Yellow Line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In verified clips, armoured personnel carriers and bulldozers were seen 400m past the mapped Yellow Line at the Bani Suhaila roundabout in Khan Younis, while a satellite image taken on 25 December appeared to show a tank, excavator and other IDF vehicles positioned about 260m beyond the Yellow Line in Beit Lahia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some cases, the movements of blocks were followed by demolitions of nearby buildings by the IDF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the eastern part of Gaza City, satellite images show that hundreds of buildings were levelled up to and even beyond the first position of the blocks, then the markers were moved and there was further destruction</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the nearby area of Jabalia, Israeli troops demolished a series of school buildings that were around 150m inside the mapped line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In some instances where IDF demolitions have occurred, the debris has effectively hidden the markers from Palestinians on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An IDF spokesperson said that troops were dismantling Hamas' tunnel network that it said runs under buildings on both sides of the Yellow Line, adding that the tunnels' destruction \"may cause the collapse of buildings on both sides of the line\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday, the US said the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjw1nxe5pvlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">second phase of the ceasefire deal is due to begin</a>, under which Israel is expected to withdraw from additional parts of the Strip.

questionable policy from the central bank and testing the legal limits to get it - to Martin Redrado, sitting in Argentina, Donald Trump's stand-off with the Federal Reserve feels surprisingly familiar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado was fired as head of Argentina's central bank in 2010, after he resisted orders by then-President Cristina Kirchner to hand over reserves to help pay off national debts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He fought the decision successfully in court, but eventually resigned in the face of what he told the BBC was \"intolerable\" pressure. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, the clash is remembered as one of the early warnings of the economic turmoil that later engulfed Argentina, exposing it to high inflation and a currency plunge from which the country is still recovering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's fight with the Fed has sparked debate about whether the US might be heading in a similar direction.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since his return to office last year, Trump has accused the chair of the US central bank, Jerome Powell, of mishandling the economy and driving up debt costs for the government by keeping interest rates too high.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his interventions at the bank have not been limited to social media complaints.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Trump moved to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx275n8gx0ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">sack a top policymaker, Lisa Cook</a>, a decision now being challenged at the Supreme Court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then on Sunday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c801k7rkkd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Powell said the Fed was facing a criminal probe from the Department of Justice</a>, relating to cost overruns

in the 1970s, including in the US, leading to a wave of global reforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extensive academic research has since linked central bank independence to lower inflation over time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say elected officials have too many incentives to try to use bank power to secure an immediate economic boost or satisfy particular constituencies, even if it might hurt the economy over the long run. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But though Trump's pressure on the Fed is unprecedented for the US, the president is hardly the only head of state to disregard advice to leave central bankers alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the UK, former Prime Minister Liz Truss has attacked the Bank of England, criticising its independence and accusing it of having too much power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A study of central banks in 118 countries between 2010 and 2018 found roughly 10% of central banks each year faced pressure from political leaders, like Trump, wanting lower interest rates, which make borrowing less expensive and can deliver a short-term economic boost. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pressure on central bankers was most likely to emerge in countries with nationalist or populist leaders and was typically followed by higher inflation, says economist Carola Binder, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who conducted the review.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan cycled through three central bank leaders in three years between 2019 and 2021, as he looked for someone who would execute on his unorthodox view that high interest rates fed inflation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inflation soared past 50%, as the bank bowed to his demands, before he agreed to appoint leaders with more moderate views.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even in countries where central banks resisted the interference, Binder's research found that inflation tended to rise, albeit to a lesser degree, suggesting pressure alone could cause damage.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img

economy was unlikely to face as severe a fallout as smaller nations like Argentina and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some say there are already signs the fight is having consequences, pointing to an 8% fall in the value of the dollar against a basket of currencies over the last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the long term, it can be hard to identify the driver of economic damage - whether it is the loss of central bank independence or other, often related issues, like the erosion of democracy or rule of law, says Carolina Garriga, professor of political science at the University of Essex.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she says immediate market moves, like a dip in the dollar that followed the announcement of the Fed criminal probe, show investors consider central bank independence an important piece of the puzzle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to disentangle but it is not hard to disentangle when it's market reaction to an announcement.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the criminal probe became public, key Wall Street leaders and members of Congress, including some Republicans, have spoken up forcefully in defence of the Fed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Supreme Court, justices have also indicated that they see the bank as different from other arms of government, where they have let Trump's firings proceed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say they think the Fed will be able to maintain confidence in its policies, noting that it sets interest rates via a committee with 12 members, of whom the president appoints only seven and who each have long, staggered terms. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is slight concern,\" says Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics. \"But there's not a switch here that says faith in US institutions has been lost and therefore we're in a downward spiral.\" </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But much of the Fed's reputation for independence is rooted in convention, rather than legal design. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article/69/2/sqaf024/8108275\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">global comparisons of central bank independence</a>, as measured by legal features, the Fed ranks in the bottom third. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Redrado said he remained hopeful that the strength of US institutions would prevail, unlike in Argentina, while warning that Trump was running unnecessary risk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump is really defeating himself by having this kind of fight,\" he said. \"He should know better.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Last Friday she posted her request for help. By Saturday the response was so large that she went to the police to warn them that there could be disruption in the village and extra officers were brought in to manage the situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The banquet celebration, by then huge in size, went on for two days – 1,000 diners on 11 January became 2,000 the next day – with bonfires into the night and much partying, accompanied by a band.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Daidai posted that her celebration was over, urging any more visitors to enjoy the region but not visit her home. After sleeping for only four hours over two days, she said she was exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it had been an incredible moment for her and her village.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To all the strangers who answered her call she said, \"without your enthusiasm and passion, there would not have been a feast like this\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For everyone who came, the feeling was like that of a big family.

By focusing on magnets instead, one of the most widely used rare-earth products, India aims to achieve self-reliance more quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But its success will depend on how fast the country can master technology, secure materials and scale up, experts say. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pmindia.gov.in/en/news_updates/cabinet-approves-rs-7280-crore-scheme-to-promote-manufacturing-of-sintered-rare-earth-permanent-magnets-repm/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Under the scheme</a>, selected manufacturers will receive capital and sales-linked incentives to produce 6,000 tonnes of permanent magnets a year within seven years. The aim is to meet rising domestic demand, which officials expect to double in five years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Industry experts warn that money alone will not be enough.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India today imports <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2151394&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">80- 90% of its magnets</a> and related materials from China, which controls more than 90% of global rare earth processing.

Countries such as Japan, South Korea and Germany have spent years refining magnet-making technology. India in comparison has virtually no commercial-scale experience, experts say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a good step in the right direction, but it's only a start,\" says Neha Mukherjee of Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, a consulting firm that deals with batteries and rare earth elements. \"India will need strategic partnerships to import technology, skill up its workforce and then build its own capabilities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr PV Sunder Raju, chief scientist at the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI), echoed the concern. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not possible to just give 73bn rupees and expect a product without a strong background in research and development,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are several research centres, he points out, which can be put to the task. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-E8U3-4liOI\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">facility</a> was inaugurated in 2023 at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, and another <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2022185&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">plant</a> backed by public and private partners aims to produce 5,000 tonnes of magnets a year by 2030. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But neither has yet reported output.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also the question of raw materials. India holds the world's third-largest, rare earth reserves, about 8% of the global total, largely in the sands of coastal states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Yet it accounts for less than 1% of global mining. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only one mine is operational in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and until recently most of its output was exported to Japan under a bilateral deal. (In June 2025, however, India <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-moves-conserve-its-rare-earths-seeks-halt-japan-exports-sources-say-2025-06-13/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reportedly</a> asked the state miner, IREL, to suspend these exports to safeguard supplies for domestic needs.)</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e0bc/live/0346e4a0-d654-11f0-8055-9b4fb3b1f2b6.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Corbis via Getty Images Four engineers wearing beige shirts and yellow helmets stand on the shores of a beach in Kerala where rare earth traces were found\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Corbis via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Most of India's rare earth reserves are found in sands along its coast</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To be fair, India is actively working to expand mining and processing operations. For instance, it has set up the National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) under which it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2097309&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">pledged</a> to maintain stockpiles and keep its supply chain resilient.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if it does manage to tap into its own rare earth reserves, it has only some  of the elements needed to make magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, it has surpluses of lighter rare earths such as neodymium, but lacks <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1914305&amp;reg=3&amp;lang=2\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">extractable quantities</a> of heavier elements like dysprosium and terbium, which are critical for many high-performance magnets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That raises the question: even if magnets are made in India, will the raw materials still come from China?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are also concerns around the scale of this operation. India already consumes an estimated 7,000 tonnes of magnets a year, Ms Mukherjee says. Producing 6,000 tonnes by the early 2030s may still leave the country short  - and exposed - as demand continues to accelerate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If we do not scale capacity, the problem doesn't get solved. We'll still be dependent on China - and China will scale,\" Ms Mukherjee explains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts also point out that another challenge will be to price domestically made magnets in a way that they don't get undercut by imports. Chinese magnets are cheap and, unless Indian-made alternatives are competitively priced, imports could continue to dominate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The solution, some argue, may lie in incentives not just for manufacturers but for buyers as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The hope is that Indian players will continue to put in their entrepreneurial energy and get the ecosystem going,\" Mr Gupta says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the challenges, the introduction of the scheme is a recognition of India's ambition to bolster its own rare earth ecosystem, and that's worthwhile, he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think this is certainly better than not having taken the step at all.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
