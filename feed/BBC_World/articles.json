But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power goes - by implication to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Washington Post via Getty Images A man wheels a barrow towards a dumpster on a road that is overlooked by the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on the Russian controlled southern bank side of the Dnipro river\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Washington Post via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other sticking points that could derail deal</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU. Few believe it will happen very soon.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could Ukrainians hold a vote on a deal?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian leader has cited opinion polls that suggest 87% of Ukrainians want peace, while at the same time 85% reject withdrawing from Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he believes no decision on either the fate of Donetsk or the broader 20-point plan can be made without a popular vote and a 60-day ceasefire to prepare it: \"A referendum is the way to accept it or not accept it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This too is a potential sticking point as the Kremlin argues a temporary ceasefire would only prolong the conflict and lead to renewed hostilities - and Trump has said he understands Putin's position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But without such a vote Zelensky believes a deal would have no validity which just adds to the list of thorny issues to be resolved.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

As soldiers, we value our word very much,\" he said at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The junta leader broke his promise by putting his name on the ballot after a new constitution, implemented in September, permitted him to run for office. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eight other candidates took part in Sunday's election, but with the exclusion of main opposition parties RPG Arc en Ciel and UFDG, none of the participants have a solid political footing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although he is popular with many of Guinea's youth, Gen Doumbouya has been criticised for restricting opposition activities, banning protests and stifling press freedom in the run-up to the elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The general justified deposing Condé on similar charges - including rampant corruption, disregard for human rights and economic mismanagement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Guinea has the world's largest bauxite reserves and some of its richest iron ore.

A petition launched by Ciotti since has attracted more than 23,000 signatures, and has the backing of some allies on the far right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Socialist leader Olivier Faure has pointed out that national homages are for \"exceptional services to the nation\". Bardot was an iconic actress but she also \"turned her back on republican values\", Faure argued.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardot has been hailed by President Emmanuel Macron as a \"legend of the century\" who embodied a life of freedom, and Ciotti, who leads the right-wing UDR party, has appealed to him to organise a national send-off.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ciotti said France should recognise a woman who brought her country an extraordinary level of international recognition and actively helped in the fight for  women's liberty and abortion rights.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced that his city will name an \"iconic site\" in Bardot's honour. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Bardot is destined to remain controversial in death as she was during her life. Faure pointed out that she had been convicted five times for inciting racial hatred.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardot starred in some 50 films, after bursting on to the scene in And God Created Woman in 1956. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She then left the world of cinema in 1973 for a life devoted to animal welfare, and lived for decades in Saint-Tropez on the French Riviera, at her home called La Madrague.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she became as well known for her far-right sympathies as she was for her love of animals. Some of her remarks targeted Muslims, and others insulted the people of the French Indian Ocean island of Réunion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"To be moved by the plight of dolphins and yet be indifferent to the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean - what degree of cynicism is that?\" asked Green MP Sandrine Rousseau on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are differing types of national tribute in France. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robert Badinter, who abolished the death penalty in France, was honoured with a national homage in the form of a solemn ceremony in 2024, as was singer Charles Aznavour in 2018. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A more likely option for Bardot would be along the lines of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-42291491\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the public farewell given to rock star Johnny Hallyday</a>, when large crowds lined the streets of Paris in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not everyone on the left is opposed to the idea of a national homage to Bardot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why not?

She was 80 years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution in late 2024 unseated Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thrust into the political limelight following the assassination of her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, she went on to become Bangladesh's first female PM in 1991. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with Hasina. She was acquitted of corruption and allowed to travel to London for treatment only after Hasina lost power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Physicians said on Monday that Zia's condition was \"extremely critical\". She was put on life support, but it was not possible to provide multiple treatments at the same time given her age and overall poor health, they added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our favourite leader is no longer with us. She left us at 6am this morning,\" Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced on Facebook on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When news of her death broke, crowds gathered outside Evercare Hospital in Dhaka where Zia had been admitted. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the wife of Bangladesh's former president Rahman, Zia was a reserved presence alongside her famous husband. When he was killed in a military coup in 1981, Zia entered politics and went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Known as an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to take part in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, Zia broke through a male-dominated political landscape and transformed into one of Bangladesh's most formidable political leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her first term was widely praised for efforts to improve women's education and social development, with her government bringing back parliamentary democracy by amending the constitution with bipartisan support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her second term in 1996, which lasted only weeks, drew criticism for staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority — a measure parliament approved before dissolving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia returned as prime minister in 2001, stepping down in October 2006 ahead of a general election. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past 16 years, under the Awami League government, Zia became the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She boycotted the 2014 election after her rival Hasina scrapped the caretaker government system — a provision meant to ensure neutrality during national polls. Later, Zia was convicted on corruption charges and jailed. She denied wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was released in January 2025, soon after mass anti-government protests in Bangladesh toppled Hasina, forcing her into exile in India. She has since been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">convicted and sentenced to death</a> for crimes against humanity over her crackdown of the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BNP had said in November that Zia would campaign in the upcoming general elections. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia had been in hospital for the past month, receiving treatment for kidney damage, heart disease and pneumonia, among other conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being kept away from public life due to her health, Zia remained a figurehead for opposition forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus had called for the country to pray for Zia, calling her a \"source of utmost inspiration for the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Tuesday, Yunus offered his condolences for the passing of Zia, whom he described as a \"symbol of the democratic<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The nation has lost a great guardian... Her role in the struggle to establish democracy, a multi-party political culture, and the rights of the people in Bangladesh will be remembered forever,\" he said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina's party, the Awami League, now banned in Bangladesh, issued a statement from Hasina on X paying tribute to Zia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina, who is still in India, said in her statement that Zia's \"contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered\", and her passing was a \"profound loss for Bangladesh's political life\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is \"deeply saddened\" by Zia's passing and paid tribute to her contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, and its relations with India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,\" he wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia \"a committed friend of Pakistan\", whose service to Bangladesh would leave a lasting legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia's family members, including Rahman, his wife and his daughter, were by her side in her last moments, BNP said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,\" the party said in its statement on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-fan-wang\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Fan Wang</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

I certainly have seen it,\" Trump told reporters at a press conference on Monday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, nothing worries me. They've been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area,\" he said of the drills, which have ramped up in recent years and now include simulating a blockade of the island. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The drills, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87l7xjp235o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">which began on Monday,</a> take place nearly two weeks after the US announced <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7095g45p1po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">one of its largest-ever arms sales</a> to Taiwan. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The drills are<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>a warning against \"Taiwan independence separatist forces\" and \"external interference\", the Chinese military said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They include 10 hours of live-firing exercises in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese military's Eastern Theater Command in charge of the Taiwan Strait said it has lined up destroyers, frigates and fighter-bombers to test \"sea-air coordination\" and \"integrated containment capabilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected 130 Chinese military aircraft around the island on Tuesday morning, 90 of which crossed the \"median line\" - an unofficial border dividing China and Taiwan, the validity of which China rejects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such incursions, however, have been happening even when there are no drills, as Beijing practises so-called <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">grey-zone warfare tactics</a> aimed at weakening Taiwan's defences over a prolonged period.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Taiwanese ministry said on Tuesday that it had spotted more than a dozen Chinese navy vessels near the island. Taiwan's armed forces monitored the situation and have deployed aircraft, ships and coastal missile systems in response, the ministry said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the drills, calling them a challenge to international norms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a Tuesday morning statement on social media, President Lai Ching-te said the Chinese Communist Party's escalation of military pressure was \"not something that a responsible power should do\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will act responsibly and not escalate conflict or stir up disputes,\" he said, adding that Taiwan's military and national security team would \"do their best to ensure the safety of the country\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"main audience\" for this week's drills \"really is the United States, Donald Trump and Japan more than the people of Taiwan,\" Susan Shirk, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the BBC's Newsday programme. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's an expression of resolve and anger\" about the US arm sales, which now include not only defensive weapons but also offensive equipment that could strike the Chinese mainland, Ms Shirk added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also pointed out concerns in the US that President Trump \"is less committed to America's defence of Taiwan than previous presidents had been\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's engaged in a kind of transactional policy in which he might be willing to reduce some of America's commitment to Taiwan, in exchange for other trade or economic benefits,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alexander Neill, an adjunct fellow with the Pacific Forum, told the BBC that the ongoing exercise is \"designed to demonstrate an operational capability by the People's Liberation Army at sea and in the air\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is \"not wrong\" about China's ramping of up such exercises over the past two decades, which is in line with the modernisation of its military, Mr Neill says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he adds, \"if [Trump] is suggesting that his rapport with Xi Jinping will have any bearing on Xi's approach to the Taiwan Strait, I think he's deluding himself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to take it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has in recent years <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">ramped up pressure</a> over Taipei with military drills and regular incursions into its waters and airspace. Taiwan in turn has plans to boost defence spending to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwnwep9qeo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">modernise its armed forces</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Trump has downplayed Beijing's ongoing drills, his administration had recently announced a $11bn (£8.2bn) weapons package to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan and the island's biggest arms supplier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China hit back at the sale with sanctions on several US defence firms. Its foreign ministry also said that any attempt to \"contain China by using Taiwan will absolutely not succeed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday that China must \"firmly counter\" what he described as \"continuous provocations from pro-independence forces in Taiwan\" and the \"large-scale arms sales\" from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the \"complete national reunification\" of Taiwan was \"a historical mission we must accomplish\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Venezuela's government is yet to respond.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The explosion was caused by a drone strike carried out by the CIA, according to CNN and the New York Times, which cited sources close to the matter. If confirmed, it would be the first known US operation inside Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously threatened land strikes in Venezuela, as well as authorising covert CIA action, as part of a pressure campaign on President Nicolás Maduro.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There has been no official comment on Trump's remarks from Venezuela and - while there has been speculation on social media - there are no reports of any strikes in Venezuelan state-run media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the target was a cocaine factory in the Venezuelan port city of Maracaibo.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a post on X on Tuesday, Petro suggested the facility was controlled by the ELN guerrilla group, writing: \"We know that Trump bombed a factory, in Maracaibo, which we fear was mixing coca paste to make cocaine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reporters asked Trump on Monday if the CIA had carried out the attack, and he said: \"I don't want to say that. I know exactly who it was, but I don't want to say who it was.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the second time Trump has mentioned the explosion. In a radio interview last week, he described a US operation against a \"big facility\", but provided limited details. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US strike on land would constitute a marked escalation in the pressure the Trump administration has put on Maduro, whom the US has accused of leading a \"narco-terrorist\" organisation - an accusation the Venezuelan president has denied.  </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since September, the US has launched 30 strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats, targeting vessels in the Pacific and the Caribbean, and killing more than 100 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent strike was on Monday, with US Southern Command saying in a social media post that two \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in a \"lethal kinetic strike\" in the eastern Pacific. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US has provided no evidence to back up its allegations that the boats it struck were carrying drugs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the exception of two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorean national - none of the identities of those on board have been made public. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, Trump provided little detail about the alleged strike on land, but seemed to signal that a new phase in the pressure campaign on Venezuela had been reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area.

Black-browed Albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the sea birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Assocication for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird scarring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird scarring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird-scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called Tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of the seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.</p></div><figure><div

of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Overcoming fear and establishing control</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli psychologists working with children

specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'We were dehumanised'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"VCG via Getty Images A Rwandan girl sitting on a roadside with some luggage \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">VCG via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mirrorpix/Getty Images A group of people going about their days in Rwanda following the civil war\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Liaison/ Getty Images A child dries her face June 24, 1994 at the Nyarushishi Tutsi refugee camp on the Zaire border in Gisenyi, Rwanda\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Liaison/ Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Global conflicts that have affected millions of children -

Her father had died before the slaughter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Creating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-harriet-whitehead\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Harriet Whitehead</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credit:-epa/shutterstock\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credit: EPA/Shutterstock</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded.

Then the number rises in February, when  Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mukashev (inset) signed up for the army after he was given a 10-year jail term</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022.

In fact, the versatile naan diligently props up whatever it is paired with, allowing the main dish to shine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's probably why this flatbread has become one of the most popular breads in the world. Recently, butter garlic naan - a flavour-packed rendition of the traditional naan - <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tasteatlas.com/breads\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">topped Taste Atlas' best breads list</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is made by brushing butter onto a piping hot naan and sprinkling a generous amount of chopped garlic on it. Also on the list was aloo naan - made by stuffing the naan with potatoes seasoned with spices and coriander.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While today naans and its versions have become ubiquitous in restaurants serving Indian or Middle Eastern fare, they were once served only in the courts of Islamic kings. So, how did the naan travel from royal kitchens to our plates?</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f592/live/7044d0b0-df93-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The Met Illustration of a man giving a flatbread to a dog\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">The Met</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">An illustration from Naan wa Halwa - a manuscript by the Sufi poet Muhammad Baha'al-Din 'Amili, circa 1690</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The origins of the naan are murky but many food historians believe that the flatbread originated in ancient Persia, since it derives its name from the the Persian word for bread. The Persians used water and flour to make the bread, which was most-likely baked on hot pebbles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The naan travelled to the Indian subcontinent with the Sultans who ruled large parts of the subcontinent between the 13th and 16th Centuries. The Muslim rulers brought with them culinary traditions that spoke of their Western and Central Asian roots, which included using a tandoor (clay oven) to cook food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amir Khusrau, an Indo-Persian poet who documented courtly life during the reign of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Bin Tughlaq, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://scroll.in/magazine/1056231/in-the-poetry-of-amir-khusrau-food-is-served-with-style-and-flourish\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mentioned two types of naans</a> in his writings - naan-e-tanuk and naan-i-tanuri. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the former was delicate and thin, the latter was a thick, puffy flatbread baked in a tandoor. During the Delhi Sultanate, naans were usually enjoyed with different meat preparations, like kebabs (meat grilled on skewers over charcoal) and keema (minced meat).</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0dbf/live/f7387680-dfb6-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Two naan breads topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, grated cheese, basil, mushrooms and what looks like it could be chicken strips\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pizza naan uses the flatbread as a base</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cooks in the royal kitchens also advanced the art of naan-making by introducing specialised kneading techniques and adding yeast - a rare ingredient at the time - to make the bread softer and fluffier. Because of its complex and expensive preparation, the naan became a luxury food item enjoyed largely by the nobility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This remained the norm during the reign of subsequent Mughal emperors as well, which stretched over the next three centuries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Specialised cooks, called naan bais, made and experimented with the flatbread, using adjectives to highlight their innovations.

Back in India, the naan weaved its way into colonial cuisine, as it began being paired with cured meats or sauces infused with local spices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But over time, complex preparations gave way to simpler techniques and a more basic preparation of the naan became accessible to the common man, like the variety we see in most local restaurants today,\" says Ms Vermani.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Today, naan is made by combing flour, yogurt and yeast and kneading them into a soft dough. The dough is left to rise before being divided into balls and patted into shape by hand. The naan is then placed in a very hot tandoor until it puffs up and brown spots appear. It is lightly brushed with butter or ghee before serving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the story of the naan doesn't end here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the 1990s and 2000s, the naan saw a fresh wave of innovations as fine dining restaurants in India and abroad began experimenting with the flatbread. Chef Suvir Saran recollects how his restaurant in New York began infusing naan with spinach, gouda and mushrooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a way to jazz up the naan to make it more appealing for non-Indians, while Indians could feel less guilty about eating their traditional food abroad,\" Mr Saran says.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87ff/live/605a5f70-dfb7-11f0-95b0-35d25df8e999.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"The Cleveland Museum of Art, Andrew R. and Martha Holden Jennings Fund 1971 Opium Smokers Served Fruit and Bread, circa 1750, gum tempera and gold on paper\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">The Cleveland Museum of Art, Andrew R. and Martha Holden Jennings Fund 1971</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A 1750 painting showing people enjoying naan and smoking opium</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend spread like wildfire and today, restaurants across the world are serving experimental naans stuffed and sprinkled with a variety of food items. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You'll find a restaurant in Goa serving a pork vindaloo naan or a butter chicken naan, while there's one in Hong Kong that serves a truffle cheese naan,\" Mr Saran says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The naan is India's glorious culinary gift to the world,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Food historians may not fully agree - naan belongs to other South Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines as well - but its ties to India are deep and long-standing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Saran says that the naan offers a message on belonging and the Indian identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The naan tells a story of plurality; of cross-cultural identities co-existing in harmony,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It shows us that differences need not cancel out each other when they can be celebrated together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I watched the Cold War reach its height, then simply evaporate. But I've never seen a year quite as worrying as 2025 has been - not just because several major conflicts are raging but because it is becoming clear that one of them has geopolitical implications of unparalleled importance.</b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the current conflict in his country could escalate into a world war. After nearly 60 years of observing conflict, I've got a nasty feeling he's right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nato governments are on high alert for any signs that Russia is cutting the undersea cables that carry the electronic traffic that keeps Western society going.

Their hackers develop ways of putting ministries, emergency services and huge corporations out of operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities in the west are certain Russia's secret services murder and attempt to murder dissidents who have taken refuge in the West.

There is Ukraine of course, where the UN says 14,000 civilians have died. In Gaza, where Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu promised \"mighty vengeance\" after about 1,200 people were killed when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 and 251 people were taken hostage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action, including more than 30,000 women and children according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry – figures the UN considers reliable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile there has been a ferocious civil war between two military factions in Sudan. More than 150,000 people have been killed there over the past couple of years; around 12 million have been forced out of their homes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maybe, if this had been the only war in 2025, the outside world would have done more to stop it; but it wasn't.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm good at solving wars,\" said US President Donald Trump, as his aircraft flew him to Israel after he had negotiated a ceasefire in the Gaza fighting. It's true that fewer people are dying in Gaza now. Despite the ceasefire, the Gaza war certainly doesn't feel as though it's been solved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the appalling suffering in the Middle East it may sound strange to say the war in Ukraine is on a completely different level to this.

Some conflicts, such as Vietnam, the first Gulf War, and the war in Kosovo, did occasionally look as though they might tip over into something much worse, but they never did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The great powers were too nervous about the dangers that a localised, conventional war might turn into a nuclear one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" the British Gen Sir Mike Jackson reportedly shouted over his radio in Kosovo in 1999, when his Nato superior ordered British and French forces to seize an airfield in Pristina after the Russian troops had got there first.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the coming year, 2026, though, Russia, noting President Trump's apparent lack of interest in Europe, seems ready and willing to push for much greater dominance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At a later televised event he said: \"There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/741c/live/2ee49c70-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a statement during a press conference\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin said Russia was not planning to go to war with Europe, but was ready \"right now\" if Europeans wanted to</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But already Russia, a major world power, has invaded an independent European country, resulting in huge numbers of civilian and also military deaths.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for his involvement in this, something Russia has always denied.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia says it invaded in order to protect itself against Nato encroachment, but President Putin has indicated another motive:  the desire to restore Russia's regional sphere of influence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">An increasingly different America</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is gratefully aware that this last year, 2025, has seen something most Western countries had regarded as unthinkable: the possibility that an American president might turn his back on the strategic system which has been in force ever since World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not only is Washington now uncertain it wants to protect Europe, it disapproves of the direction it believes Europe is heading in. The Trump administration's new national security strategy report claims Europe now faces the \"stark prospect of civilisational erasure\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin welcomed the report, saying it is consistent with Russia's own vision. You bet it is.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inside Russia, Putin has silenced most internal opposition to himself and to the Ukraine war, according to the UN special rapporteur focusing on human rights in Russia.

His henchmen make bloodcurdling threats about wiping the UK and other European countries off the map with Russia's vaunted new weapons, but he's usually much more restrained himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Americans are still active members of Nato, the risk that they could respond with a devastating nuclear attack of their own is still too great.

But two years ago the then director of the CIA William Burns said Xi Jinping had ordered the People's Liberation Army to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. If China doesn't take some sort of decisive action to claim Taiwan, Xi Jinping could consider this to look pretty feeble. He won't want that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You might think that China is too strong and wealthy nowadays to worry about domestic public opinion. Not so. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ever since the uprising against Deng Xiaoping in 1989, which ended with the Tiananmen massacre, Chinese leaders have monitored the way the country reacts with obsessive care. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I watched the events unfold in Tiananmen myself, reporting and even sometimes living in the Square.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/28ec/live/3c28e990-dcde-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool  (L-R) Russia's President Vladimir Putin walks with China's President Xi Jinping and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images, Sputnik, Pool</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Xi Jinping (centre) has made few outright threats against Taiwan recently</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The story of 4 June 1989 wasn't as simple as we thought at the time: armed soldiers shooting down unarmed students. That certainly happened, but there was another battle going on in Beijing and many other Chinese cities. Thousands of ordinary working-class people came out onto the streets, determined to use the attack on the students as a chance to overthrow the control of the Chinese Communist Party altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When I drove through the streets two days later, I saw at least five police stations and three local security police headquarters burned out. In one suburb the angry crowd had set fire to a policeman and propped up his charred body against a wall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A uniform cap was put at a jaunty angle on his head, and a cigarette had been stuck between his blackened lips.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It turns out the army wasn't just putting down a long-standing demonstration by students, it was stamping out a popular uprising by ordinary Chinese people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China's political leadership, still unable to bury the memories of what happened 36 years ago, is constantly on the look-out for signs of opposition - whether from organised groups like Falun Gong or the independent Christian church or the democracy movement in Hong Kong, or just people demonstrating against local corruption. All are stamped on with great force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I have spent a good deal of time reporting on China since 1989, watching its rise to economic and political dominance.  I even came to know a top politician who was Xi Jinping's rival and competitor. His name was Bo Xilai, and he was an anglophile who spoke surprisingly openly about China's politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He once said to me, \"You'll never understand how insecure a government feels when it knows it hasn't been elected.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Bo Xilai, he was jailed for life in 2013 after being found guilty of bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">John Simpson has reported on China many times over the years - pictured in Tiananmen Square, 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Altogether, then, 2026 looks like being an important year. China's strength will grow, and its strategy for taking over Taiwan - Xi Jinping's great ambition - will become clearer. It may be that the war in Ukraine will be settled, but on terms that are favourable to President Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He may be free to come back for more Ukrainian territory when he's ready. And President Trump, even though his political wings could be clipped in November's mid-term elections, will distance the US from Europe even more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From the European point of view, the outlook could scarcely be more gloomy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If you thought World War Three would be a shooting-match with nuclear weapons, think again. It's much more likely to be a collection of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, which will see autocracy flourish.  It could even threaten to break up the Western alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the process has already started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credits:-afp-/-getty-images\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credits: AFP / Getty Images</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Presidents Trump and Zelensky had never before spent this long in one room, negotiating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Afterwards, optimism was much on display at Mar-a-Lago. It was a \"terrific meeting\", according to Donald Trump. Volodymyr Zelensky agreed, describing it as a \"great meeting\" with \"great discussions on all the topics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But even if the two presidents sounded more upbeat than before, yet again we did not hear any evidence of progress - just like after all the previous talks held this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is still no answer to the key question of whether Ukraine will have to give up territory in exchange for a promise of peace. This is one of the main demands put forward by Russia and apparently backed by the US, so the fact that Zelensky has not accepted it - at least not in public - counts as good news for Ukraine. He did appear to leave the possibility of territorial concessions open, however, by saying that a referendum may be held to approve any deals to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also no clarity on another crucial issue: security guarantees. Even though President Zelensky says they were \"100%\" agreed with the US, we do not know what they are and whether they would be enough to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No less importantly, regardless of what agreements presidents Trump and Zelensky may have reached, there is no reason to assume that Russia would accept them. In fact, it has already rejected key ideas floated immediately before the talks in Florida: that a ceasefire be declared and a multinational force be deployed to Ukraine to monitor it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this begs the question of what Donald Trump is prepared to do should Russia reject his agreements with Volodymyr Zelensky. So far, it has been the Ukrainian leader who has borne the brunt of his pressure, irritation and anger. Donald Trump's continuing positive rhetoric about Vladimir Putin (who, the US president said today, is \"serious\" about peace and \"wants to see Ukraine succeed\") suggests that this is unlikely to change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the end of the day, all this means that despite Donald Trump's and Volodymyr Zelensky's optimism, we've seen little indication that lasting peace will prevail in Ukraine any time soon.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Over the past year, frustrations have reached a boiling point.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Bengaluru - often called India's Silicon Valley for its many IT companies and start-up headquarters - there were public outbursts from citizens and billionaire entrepreneurs alike, fed up with its traffic snarls and garbage piles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Mumbai, the financial capital, citizens staged a rare protest against worsening pothole problem, as clogged sewage lines dumped garbage onto flooded roads during the extended monsoon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Delhi's annual winter of discontent, toxic smog left children and the elderly gasping, with doctors advising some to leave the city. Even footballer Lionel Messi's visit this month was overshadowed by fans chanting against the capital's poor air quality.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d207/live/069a3430-deed-11f0-bf1c-d117288a662a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images A protest leaflet in front of a massive pothole in Thane - a satellite suburb of Mumbai. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Residents of Thane near Mumbai staged a protest over potholes and traffic congestion in September</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So why, unlike China during its boom years, isn't India's blazing GDP growth leading to a regeneration of its decrepit cities? </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For instance, why is Mumbai - which publicly harboured dreams of becoming another Shanghai in the 1990s - unable to realise that ambition?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The root cause is historical - our cities don't have a credible governance model,\" Vinayak Chatterjee, a veteran infrastructure expert, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When India's constitution was written, it spoke of the devolution of power to the central and state governments - but it did not imagine that our cities would grow to become so massive that they would need a separate governance structure,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL?locations=IN\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">World Bank</a> estimates that over half a billion Indians, or nearly 40% of the country's population, now live in urban areas - a staggering rise from 1960 when merely 70 million Indians lived in cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An attempt was made in 1992 to \"finally allow cities to take charge of their own destinies\" through the 74th amendment of the Constitution.

even before the US air strikes on the Islamist militants who have made this area their base on Christmas night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The heavily armed jihadists, who dress in camouflage and wear vibrant turbans, have lived in camps in Tangaza, a remote area of Sokoto state near the border with Niger, for several years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They belong to a group called Lakurawa and hail from areas north of Nigeria in the Sahel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Locals in Tangaza, a community made up of mainly moderate Muslims, believe they come from Niger and Mali -

fearing reprisal if they spoke.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was only after assurances that their identities would be kept anonymous that some men agreed to be interviewed, speaking in hushed tones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We had travelled into the dangerous area, about 12km from the Niger border, on Saturday under police escort and with extra security personnel for protection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police do not usually venture into this region as they say they do not have enough fire power to confront the militants should they come under attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our team was not able to reach the site of the strikes because of ongoing security risks -

They are agile and use motorbikes to move quickly across the region's rough and rugged terrain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is not hard to see how the group has been able to gain a foothold here as there is very little sign of a government presence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no visible schools, hospitals or paved roads. Much of the terrain can only be reached using vehicles capable of navigating rough desert paths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Nukuru, the villagers' main means of transport appeared to be donkeys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said that by day the Lakurawa militants come into the community - having established themselves as the de facto governing authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The farmers and villagers have no option but to agree to their terms and taxes as the Islamists are well-armed. If they do not comply, they are attacked and their livestock is stolen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The farmer who spoke to the BBC said the fighters passed through his hamlet most days on their way to other communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We knew they are Lakurawa because of their dressing,\" he said, describing their camouflage uniforms and their turbans usually worn by men in desert areas of Mali and Niger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amongst themselves the militants spoke Fulfude - the language of the Fulani ethnic group spoken in many West African countries - but communicated with the locals in Hausa, the lingua franca of the region, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At night, the fighters go back to their isolated camps, which are on higher ground and give them a good vantage point over the plains. No women or families are thought to be living in these makeshift bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lakurawa initially arrived in the largely Muslim states of Sokoto and Kebbi, the group presented itself as a religious force that wanted to help a vulnerable community in an insecure region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria faces an array of complex security issues.
