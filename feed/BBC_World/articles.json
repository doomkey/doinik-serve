Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July, Bloomberg <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-27/india-offers-eu-auto-quota-six-times-larger-than-uk-deal?srnd=homepage-asia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reported</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Delhi said almost all of its exports would get \"preferential access\" into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi \"has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities\", it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is India's biggest free trade agreement,\" Modi said. \"It will make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Italy's interior minister, Matteo Pantedosi, had initially appeared unaware that US immigration officials would be coming to the Milan-Cortina Olympics and said even if they were, foreign delegations could choose their own security, saying: \"I don't see what the problem is and it's very normal.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as shock at the images emanating from Minneapolis grew, so did the outcry in Italy that officers from the same US federal agency could appear on Italian streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the aftermath of Alex Pretti being shot on the streets of Minneapolis by federal agents on Saturday morning, two journalists for Italian public broadcaster Rai were threatened by ICE officials as the reporters drove around the city covering the agency's actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Rai TV report showed one agent warned the crew that if they kept filming the agents, their car window would be smashed.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The governor of Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, sought to calm the situation, suggesting that ICE agents would be deployed in Italy to protect US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Political opponents of right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, such as Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia, warned that continued government silence on the issue would provide \"yet more evidence of cowardice and subservience towards Donald Trump\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The interior minister has since taken a stronger stand, maintaining on Monday that \"ICE will certainly not operate on Italian national territory\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had not communicated a list of security personnel, and security was guaranteed by the Italian state, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The centre-left mayor of Milan was unimpressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I believe [ICE agents]shouldn't come to Italy because they don't guarantee they conform to our democratic way of ensuring security,\" Beppe Sala told RTL radio.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

And the president himself has avoided the language used by some of his top aides that sought to blame Pretti for Saturday's tragedy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His administration is facing pressure from some prominent Republicans, who have joined opposition Democrats in calling for a wide-ranging investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, a Republican contender to become state governor dropped out of that election race, calling the enforcement operation in Minnesota an \"unmitigated disaster\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That candidate was Chris Madel, a defence lawyer who has provided advice to the agent who earlier this month shot dead another US citizen in Minneapolis, Renee Good.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino was the face of the operation when Pretti - an observer seen filming agents - became involved in a confrontation that ended in Pretti being shot numerous times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The commander claimed that Pretti intended to \"massacre\" federal agents - a statement that angered many protesters on the streets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him on Saturday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out Pretti had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents, meanwhile, have accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no sign of a gun in Pretti's hand, according to analysis of the available video by BBC Verify.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino has been key to the Trump administration's hard-line approach to immigration enforcement in several cities, active on social media and regularly filming raids and posting promotional videos showing his agents' action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homan, who will report directly to the president, advocates for the aggressive immigration enforcement pushed by Trump. But he also has longer-term experience in the role, having worked with immigration and deportations during the Democratic presidency of Barack Obama. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some media reports suggested Bovino had been let go from his role, but DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin denied that, saying the Border Patrol chief was \"a key part of the president's team and a great American\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a7b1/live/75808890-fb62-11f0-a422-4ba8a094a8fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Tom Homan dressed in a suit speaks to reporters outside the White House\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tom Homan has decades of law enforcement experience</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tension and frustration over the presence of federal officials remained high in Minneapolis on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of people aren't able to work right now, they aren't able to leave their house, they're afraid,\" said George Cordero, a resident of St Paul, Minneapolis', sister city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carol Engelheart, a retired nurse from Minneapolis, said events in the city had left her shaken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to care about this country, we need to care that we have a Constitution left, and if the people organise and the people stand up, we can do this,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse, was the second Minneapolis resident shot and killed by federal immigration officials since their arrival in the state. The first, Renee Good, was killed by an Immigration and Customs Border Enforcement (ICE) agent on 7 January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of the anger in the city and from politicians on both sides of the aisle was directed at Bovino and the Border Patrol agents who were sent to Minneapolis along with ICE agents at Trump's directive. In total, there are approximately 3,000 immigration agents in the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Micayla Pretti, Alex Pretti's younger sister, released a statement on Monday, the Associated Press reported, calling her brother \"my hero\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When does this end? How many more innocent lives must be lost before we say enough?\" her statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Memorials for Pretti and demonstrations against ICE action continued on Monday night, including one that saw about a hundred people gather outside the hotel Bovino was believed to be staying in and demand that he leave the city. More vigils and demonstrations are planned for the coming days. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"We're all terrified\", Minnesotan tells the BBC in tears</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's crackdown in Minneapolis was launched in December after some Somali immigrants were convicted in a massive fraud of state welfare programmes. The wider state of Minnesota is home to the largest community of Somali immigrants in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that it is the president's \"hope and wish and demand for the resistance and chaos\" in Minneapolis to end. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During his calls on Monday, Trump spoke to both Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey - Democratic leaders who have resisted the immigration efforts and demanded agents be removed from the state. Trump has sharply criticised both men in recent weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Trump, the local leaders characterised the talks as positive - a sign that both sides were seeking a way to end their standoff over the president's deportation drive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he and Walz were \"on a similar wavelength\" and said his target was \"any and all criminals that they have in their possession\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The president agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and to talk to DHS about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case,\" Walz said after the call. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ensuring an independent investigation into Pretti's death has been a central focus for Walz. In its immediate aftermath, local authorities obtained a judicial warrant to gain access to the crime scene to preserve evidence. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the aftermath of Good's shooting, local and state authorities said they were being kept out of the investigation by federal immigration officials. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Frey meanwhile said he hoped to meet Homan on Tuesday to discuss next steps.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the Republicans who have so far shown disquiet over the events in Minnesota are US Senator Ted Cruz, who said on his podcast: \"I would encourage the administration to be more measured, to recognise the tragedy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Republican senator and Trump ally, Lindsey Graham, called Trump's decision to send Homan to Minneapolis \"a very smart move\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, certain other prominent Republicans have joined opposition Democrats such as Walz to urge the Trump administration to ensure that the investigation into Pretti's killing is a wide-ranging one.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Republican senator, John Curtis from Utah, called for a \"transparent, independent investigation\" into Pretti's shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Those responsible - no matter their title - must be held accountable,\" he said.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Fredrik Hjulström, a local authority head who is reviewing the proposal, said it contained \"no factual arguments\", according to Swedish national broadcaster SVT.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that children should receive care rather than being punished and argued that the bill was about scoring political points, with the country's general election coming up in September this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile lawyer Johan Eriksson agreed that action must be taken to prevent children from being recruited by gangs, but said lowering the age of criminal responsibility would likely have the opposite effect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill will be sent to Sweden's Council on Legislation, which reviews bills the government intends to put before parliament.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Of these, car exports accounted for about $30bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially, shares in Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kai fell by up to 6% in response to Trump's announcement, but they then recovered to close only about 1% lower.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's benchmark Kospi stock index also reversed early losses to end the day up 2.7%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts said investors were sceptical whether the threatened tariff rise would go ahead, pointing to Trump's recent U‑turn on imposing extra tariffs on European trade partners over opposition to US plans to acquire Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With a delegation on its way from Seoul to Washington, markets are viewing this latest twist as more carrot than stick,\" said Derren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seoul and Washington reached a deal last October, which included a pledge from South Korea to invest $350bn (£256bn) in the US, some of which would go to shipbuilding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The following month, the two countries agreed that the US would reduce tariffs on some products once South Korea started the process to approve the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agreement was submitted to South Korea's National Assembly on 26 November and is currently being reviewed. It is likely to be passed in February, according to local media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tariffs are paid by companies who import products. In this case, US firms will pay a 25% tax on goods they buy from South Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has frequently used tariffs as leverage to enact foreign policy during his second term in the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Saturday, he threatened Canada with a 100% tariff if it struck a trade deal with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Chinese officials said its \"strategic partnership\" agreement with Canada is not meant to undercut other countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said his country was not pursuing a free trade deal with China and has \"never\" considered it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Canadian officials have made their position clear to their American counterparts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before that, Trump said he would impose import taxes on eight countries - including the UK - who opposed US plans to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark which is a member of Nato.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He later backed down from the tariff threat over Greenland citing progress towards a \"future deal\" over the island, but the episode strained US relations with Denmark and other Nato allies. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Nepal has also begun screening arrivals at Kathmandu airport and other land border points with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Five healthcare workers in West Bengal were infected by the virus early this month, one of whom is in a critical condition. Some 110 people who were in contact with them have been quarantined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The virus can spread from animals to humans. It has a high death range – ranging from 40% to 75% – as there is no vaccine or medicine to treat it.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is the Nipah virus and what are its symptoms?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Nipah virus can be transmitted from animals, like pigs and fruit bats, to humans. It can also  spread person-to-person through contaminated food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The World Health Organization has described Nipah in its top ten priority diseases, along with pathogens like Covid-19 and Zika, because of its potential to trigger an epidemic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incubation period ranges from four to 14 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People who contract the virus show a wide range of symptoms, or sometimes, none at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initial symptoms may include fever, headaches, muscle pain, vomiting and sore throat. In some people, these may be followed by drowsiness, altered consciousness, and pneumonia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Encephalitis, a sometimes-fatal condition that causes inflammation of the brain, may occur in severe cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To date, no drugs of vaccines have been approved to treat the disease. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Where were the past outbreaks?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The first recognised Nipah outbreak was in 1998 among pig farmers in Malaysia and later spread to neighbouring Singapore. The virus got its name from the village where it was first discovered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 100 people were killed and a million pigs culled in an effort to contain the virus. It also resulted in significant economic losses for farmers and those in the livestock trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladesh has borne the brunt in recent years, with more than 100 people dying of Nipah since 2001.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The virus has also been detected in India. Outbreaks were reported in West Bengal in 2001 and 2007. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, the southern state of Kerala has been a Nipah hotspot. In 2018, 19 cases were reported of which 17 were fatal; and in 2023, two out of six confirmed cases later died.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is happening now?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least five confirmed cases were reported as of last week, all of whom were linked to a private hospital in Barasat. Two nurses are being treated in an intensive coronary care unit, one of whom remains in \"very critical\" condition, local media reported citing the state's health department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No cases have yet been reported outside India, but several countries are stepping up precautions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Thailand started screening passengers at three international airports in Bangkok and Phuket that receive flights from West Bengal. Passengers from these flights have been asked to make health declarations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The parks and wildlife department has also implemented stricter screenings in natural tourist attractions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jurai Wongswasdi, a spokeswoman for the Department for Disease Control, told BBC Thai authorities are \"fairly confident\" about guarding against an outbreak in Thailand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nepal, too, has begun screening people arriving through the airport in Kathmandu and other land border points with India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, health authorities in Taiwan have proposed to list the Nipah virus as a \"Category 5 disease\". Under the island's system, diseases classified as Category 5 are emerging or rare infections with major public health risks, that require immediate reporting and special control measures.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-bbc-thai\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by BBC Thai</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Next, the bill will go to the upper house, the Senate, for approval. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If it is passed, young teenagers would not be able to use networks such as Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French move is part of a growing trend of restricting social networks for children, triggered by increasing evidence<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>of the damage they can cause to mental health. A similar law was passed in Australia late last year.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the National Assembly passed the bill in an overnight session from Monday to Tuesday, Macron called it a \"major step\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Writing on social media, he called for the government to accelerate the next steps, \"so that this ban takes effect as early as next school year\". The new school year begins on 1 September in France.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our children's brains are not for sale,\" he wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Laure Miller, an MP behind the bill, told Le Monde: \"With this law we will set down a clear limit in society.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are saying something very simple: social networks are not harmless,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These networks promised to bring people together. They pulled them apart. They promised to inform. They saturated us with information. They promised to entertain. They shut people away.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, Macron said:<b id='\"' class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> \"</b>We cannot leave the mental and emotional health of our children in the hands of people whose sole purpose is to make money out of them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the new text, the state media regulator would draw up a list of social media networks that are deemed harmful. These would be simply banned for under 15-year-olds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A separate list of supposedly less harmful sites would be accessible, but only with explicit parental approval.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another clause would ban the use of mobile telephones in senior schools (lycées).  The ban is already in effect in junior and middle schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If the law is passed, France will need to agree on the mechanism for age-verification. A system is already in place that requires over 18 year-olds to prove their age when accessing online pornography.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Europe, Denmark, Greece, Spain and Ireland are also considering following the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyp9d3ddqyo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Australian example</a>. Earlier this month, the UK government launched a consultation on banning social media for under 16s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The basis of the proposed French law is a text drawn up late last year by Miller, who chaired a parliamentary committee enquiry into the psychological effects of TikTok and other networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, the government was told to draw up its own legislation, after Macron decided to make the issue a centrepiece of his last year in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has been sidelined from domestic politics since the Assembly elections which he called in 2024 resulted in a hung parliament.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The social media ban has been a rare chance to court public favour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a time the cause risked falling victim to bickering between Macron and his one-time prime minister Gabriel Attal (Miller is an MP from Attal's party). But in the end the government appears to have rallied behind the Miller bill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill is expected to pass before the upper house, the Senate, in the next month. Macron said he had asked the government of Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to use a fast-track procedure to get the legislation on the books by September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Without resort to the fast-track (which permits a single reading as opposed to two in each of the two houses), the law would have little chance of getting past the legislative backlog created by Lecornu's difficulties in passing a budget.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill has already had to be redrafted to take account of questions raised by the Council of State, the body which previews draft legislation to ensure it conforms with French and European law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A 2023 law which proposed a similar ban on social media for young teenagers proved inoperable after courts decided it broke European law.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The musician's agent and publicist confirmed the news to the BBC. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Born Lowell Fillmore Dunbar in Kingston, Jamaica, he started out playing on tin cans, after watching Lloyd Knibbs and the Skatalites on television.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I saw [Knibbs] playing and I thought, 'I want to be a drummer' because he's the hardest worker in the band,\" he said in a 1997 interview.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's my idol! In some ways, I'm self-taught but I got a lot of help from other drummers by watching them play.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his teens, Dunbar met bassist Robbie Shakespeare and formed the rhythm section of the Revolutionaries, who became regular session musicians at the famed Channel One recording studio.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their sound differed from the melody-rich music of Bob Marley, with a heavier emphasis on the beat - including the pioneering \"rockers\" rhythm, which introduced more syncopation and energy to the music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They spent the 1970s working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown and Barrington Levy, while touring the US with Peter Tosh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to legend, the duo lived on bread and water in that period, hoping to save enough money to start their own production company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taxi Records was duly founded in 1980, and nurtured a new generation of Jamaican artists such as Shaggy, Shabba Ranks, Skip Marley, Beenie Man and Red Dragon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around the same time, they provided the thunderous beats on Grace Jones's hit 1981 album Nightclubbing, which opened the doors for them to work with some of rock and pop's greatest - from Dylan and Joe Cocker, to singers like Marianne Faithfull, Madonna and Sinead O'Connor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At home, they earned a reputation for updating the sound of reggae by incorporating more electronic instruments and textures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on, they developed a bright and melodic take on dancehall with the duo Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers, scoring hits with songs such as Tease Me and Murder She Wrote in the early 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At one point, Shakespeare (who died in 2021) estimated that he and Dunbar had taken part in more than 200,000 recordings, either their own or as backup musicians or producers for other artists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When you buy a reggae record, there's a 90% chance the drummer is Sly Dunbar,\" producer Brian Eno told the New Music New York festival in 1979. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You get the impression that Sly Dunbar is chained to a studio seat somewhere in Jamaica, but in fact what happens is that his drum tracks are so interesting, they get used again and again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dunbar's wife said she had found him unresponsive in bed at around 07:00 on Monday, 26 January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,\" she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yesterday was such a good day for him,\" Thelma told Jamaica's Gleaner newspaper. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time.

I knew he was sick... but I didn't know that he was this sick.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among those paying tribute was British DJ David Rodigan, who called Dunbar a \"true icon\" and \"one of the greatest drummers of all time\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

Hamas's armed wing said it had provided mediators with \"all the details and information\" about Gvili's location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netanyahu's office said <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c801mj1n04lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Israel would reopen Gaza's key border crossing with Egypt</a> once the operation to find and return Gvili was complete.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prime minister hailed the return of Gvili's body, saying: \"We promised - and I promised - to bring everyone back. We brought them all back, down to the very last captive,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israeli military said the clarification of existing intelligence over the weekend had enabled the search of the cemetery near Gaza City. A military official said the cemetery \"was located in the area of the Yellow Line\", the boundary to territory still controlled by Israeli forces under the ceasefire deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hamas said it had \"kept updating the mediators with the necessary information, which resulted in retrieving the body\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Spokesman Hazem Qassem said the discovery \"confirms Hamas's commitment to all the requirements of the ceasefire agreement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Israel, Itzik Gvili, the hostage's father, paid an emotional goodbye to his son in front of his coffin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You had the option to stay home, but you said to me: 'Father, I'm not going to leave my friends to fight alone.'</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You came out, and you need to see the honour you have here, all the people who brought you. All the police are here with you, the entire army is here with you, the entire nation is here with you. I'm proud of you, my son,\" Itzik Gvili said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rani Gvili's sister Shira earlier told the Hostages and Missing Families Forum: \"I feel an insane sense of relief. I feel relieved. I am sad. I'm very sad that it ended this way, but it had to end at some point. I am so happy he's coming back home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The retrieval of Gvili may bring closure to his family and it finally ends Israel's hostage agony after 843 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also opens the way for further progress in Gaza's ceasefire deal. Israel had resisted moving forward until Gvili was found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Phase two is meant to involve the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups. The plan is also meant to see the deployment of an as-yet unconstituted International Stabilization Force (ISF) and the progressive withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, the Gvili family gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, as they had every week since he and the other 250 were abducted on 7 October 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I looked them in the eyes and said: 'We will bring Rani home',\" Netanyahu recounted on Monday. \"I promised you, citizens of Israel: We will bring everyone home.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a promise finally delivered, and will be celebrated, but his critics say it has taken too long and cost too many lives - Israeli and Palestinian.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Gvili's retrieval in a statement, saying: \"According to the information and intelligence available to us, Sgt Maj (res) Ran Gvili... a Yamam commando fighter, aged 24 at the time of his death, fell in battle on the morning of October 7, 2023, and his body was abducted to the Gaza Strip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The IDF shares in the family's grief. The IDF will continue to accompany the families and the returned hostages and to act to strengthen the security of Israel's citizens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"With this, all of the hostages from the Gaza Strip area have been returned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Netanyahu said he sent soldiers into Gaza to return the hostages and defeat Hamas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opening the Rafah border crossing is an important next step but other difficult issues have to be confronted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How will Hamas be disarmed and unpicked from the fabric of Gaza? When will Israel's army withdraw? And who will make up the international force delivering security for the future?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is the first time since 2014 there are no Israeli hostages, alive or dead, being held in Gaza - a reminder of the deep roots of this conflict and how difficult it could still be to shape a lasting peace.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6771/live/fbac28e0-fad4-11f0-a21a-e9b091602ead.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Israel Defense Forces Israeli soldiers standing near an excavator in open ground at night-time, during the search for the body of missing hostage Ran Gvili \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Israel Defense Forces</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The IDF said they searched for Gvili's body in a cemetery near Gaza City</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reacting to the return of Gvili's body, Trump posted on Truth Social: \"Just recovered the last Hostage body in GAZA.

The process took far longer, but eventually 20 living Israeli hostages and the bodies of 27 dead Israeli and foreign hostages were handed over, leaving only Gvili missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policeman was one of 251 hostages taken in the Hamas-led attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 in which about 1,200 people were killed.

Some journalists expressed surprise that his wrists were not shackled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials have not provided details of Wedding's arrest in Mexico, but his lawyer Anthony Colombo disputed reports from Mexican officials that Wedding had turned himself in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That is a false narrative,\" Colombo told the BBC outside the courthouse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He appeared in court in Santa Ana in Orange County, instead of Los Angeles, as his appearance was moved due to ongoing protests  outside the LA federal building against federal immigration operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wedding is next due in court in Los Angeles on 9 February. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Previously described as a \"modern-day iteration of Pablo Escobar\" by FBI director Kash Patel, the agency says Wedding's aliases include \"El Jefe,\" \"Giant,\" \"Public Enemy,\" \"James Conrad King,\" and \"Jesse King\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials allege that he launched his criminal enterprise following his release from a US federal prison in 2011, where he was serving a sentence for cocaine distribution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is alleged to have ordered dozens of murders across the globe, including in the US, Canada and Latin America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials say he had been living in luxury in Mexico as the search for him by both US and Canadian police ramped up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late last year, the FBI released photos of Wedding's motorcycle collection they seized in Mexico, which they say is worth about $40m (£29m). </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, RCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme said seven Canadians allegedly linked to the cartel had been arrested and would be extradited to the US.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The armed forces have consistently stressed their loyalty to civilian authority, often issuing public statements reaffirming their commitment to democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This latest development comes at a time when the West African region has experienced a resurgence of coups. Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea have all seen their governments toppled by soldiers since the beginning of the decade. However, Guinea recently returned to a democratic rule with the junta leader, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpv70mek448o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Mamadi Doumbouya elected president</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These events have created heightened vigilance among governments in the region, including Nigeria, which has traditionally positioned itself as a stabilising force within the regional grouping Ecowas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Within Nigeria, the military continues to face intense operational pressures - from fighting militant jihadist groups in the north-east to tackling criminals and communal violence across the north‑west and central states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts say such pressures, combined with resource constraints and public scrutiny, have put the spotlight on discipline within the armed forces.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The Spanish government said it did not know the cause of the incidents - but did not rule out a cyberattack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party said the Rodalies network had suffered \"decades of lack of investment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The reputational damage is as bad as or worse than the economic losses,\" said Ramon Talamàs, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Terrassa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez is due to appear before Congress on 11 February to be questioned about the rail crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These measures come as the investigation continues into the Adamuz high-speed crash, in which the rear carriages of a train heading north towards Madrid were derailed on a straight section of track, causing a collision with an oncoming train.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators have been examining a 40cm (16in) section of track that broke loose, apparently shortly before the derailment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The transport ministry has said that the line on which it happened had been renovated and undergone recent technical reviews. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it has emerged that the piece of damaged rail, which was made in 2023, had been welded onto an older section, reportedly manufactured in 1989, and the join between the two appears to be where it cracked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of the independent commission investigating the crash, Iñaki Barrón, said that \"everything appears to suggest that\" the separation of the two welded pieces of track was the cause of the tragedy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opposition politicians are demanding the resignation of Óscar Puente, accusing him of misleading the public in the wake of the tragedy.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It is so powerful that when Deng Xiaoping was the paramount leader of the country during the 1980s, this was the only position he held for most of that time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That only Xi and one CMC general remain is unprecedented, according to Lyle Morris from the Asia Society Policy Institute.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The PLA is in disarray,\" he told the BBC, adding that China's military now had \"a major leadership void\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what was really driving the culling of so many top generals, he said: \"There are a lot of rumours floating around. We don't know, at this point, what is true and what is false… but it is certainly bad for Xi Jinping, for his leadership and control over the PLA.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian from the National University of Singapore also said he was not sure what the real reason was for Zhang's downfall but that there was a lot of speculation about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everything from leaking nuclear secrets to the United States to plotting a coup and factional infighting. There are even rumours of a gunfight in Beijing,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But Zhang and Liu's downfall along with the wild speculation highlight two things: that Xi remains unassailable and there are significant limits to information in Beijing which fuels uncertainty and feeds this speculation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The official announcement that said Zhang and Liu were \"under investigation\" also said that they were accused of \"serious violations of discipline and law\", which is a euphemism for corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then the PLA Daily made this absolutely clear in an editorial, writing that this move showed the Communist Party's \"zero tolerance\" approach to \"punishing corruption… no matter who it is or how high their position\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The specific allegations being made against all of these generals have not been released to the public and may never be. However, that they have been named as under investigation almost certainly means being given a custodial sentence as a minimum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The PLA Daily editorial was already speaking of Zhang and Liu as if they were guilty, saying they had \"seriously betrayed the trust and expectations of the Communist Party's Central Committee\" as well as \"trampling on and undermining the Central Military Commission\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of the generals may be about corruption, but it may also be about power politics, given how these purges have panned out in the past.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China definitely had a corruption problem when Xi Jinping came to power, but its leader has also been accused of using his anti-corruption drive, deploying the Party's feared discipline inspection teams, to take out would-be political rivals or those in government ranks showing anything short of full loyalty to him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has given General Secretary Xi a level of unchallenged control not seen since Chairman Mao.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet this type of leadership can also be counterproductive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the military, for example, a climate of suspicion can lead to cautious – even weak – decision making.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zhang's father was a revolutionary comrade of Xi's father. The general goes back a long way with Xi and that they were seen as close allies before the turmoil of recent days has possibly made this worse because of a belief that no-one is safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was also one of only a handful of senior officers in the PLA with combat experience, making his loss significant for the military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His removal also poses longer term problems for Xi, according to Morris.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Xi may have stamped his authority, yet again, but the upheaval means ongoing frictions, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's certainly a bad look for Xi and I think there's going to be significant turmoil in the PLA, with Xi and his leaders – especially in the PLA – for years to come.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The purging of the most senior generals also brings scrutiny on the next layer of officers who may be wondering who is next?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given the fate of those above they also may not welcome promotion into the deadly zone where Xi's anti-corruption spotlight can be trained on you at any time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And all this has come at a time when Beijing is increasing pressure on Taiwan with threats to, at some point, seize the self-governing island via an all-out attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts will be weighing up just how much these removals have hampered such a possibility - though some think it will have little impact on curbing Beijing's ambitions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The purge does not affect the PRC's ambitions to control Taiwan. That comes down to the CCP as a whole and Xi specifically,\" said Chong. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where the purge may matter are operational decisions. Without top military professionals or military professionals who are cowed, decisions about escalation and aggression toward Taiwan will centre even more on Xi, his preferences, and proclivities.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-yvette-tan\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Yvette Tan</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

While he blamed the Democrats, many on both sides of America's political divide will agree that the current situation is fraught with peril.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The initial administration response to Pretti's death was straightforward. The 37-year-old was portrayed as a domestic terrorist bent on bloodshed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that Pretti wished to \"inflict harm\" and was \"brandishing\" a weapon. US Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said that it \"looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senior presidential adviser Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"would-be assassin\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This White House has typically been quick to push back when criticised. \"Deny and attack\" has long been a bedrock Trump strategy for handling adversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, perhaps tellingly, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt refused to echo Miller's comments herself on Monday when pressed on whether the president agreed with his senior adviser. Instead, she said a full investigation would be carried out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a notably more muted tone than that struck immediately after the shooting.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BBC at protests outside hotel where Trump's immigration chief believed to be staying</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That initial response had echoed the path the administration took three weeks ago, when federal law enforcement shot and killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. They said Good was a terrorist who had \"weaponised\" her vehicle in an attempt to injure ICE agents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As with Good's case, the federal government's version of events has been challenged by local officials, eyewitnesses and the victim's family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Sunday, Pretti's parents asked for the truth to come out, adding: \"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple videos of Saturday's deadly encounter contradict many of the administration's initial claims. The footage shows Pretti filming ICE agents with his mobile phone and helping a woman who is pushed over before both are pepper-sprayed. Pretti is visibly not holding a gun when he is wrestled to the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS says Pretti had a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two magazines of ammunition. Local police have said Pretti was a legal gun owner. Under Minnesota law, citizens can legally carry a concealed handgun in public, if they have a permit.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Unpicking the second Minneapolis shooting frame by frame</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This time around, the administration's initial response quickly had become difficult for the administration to maintain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People have had enough,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said, noting that his officers made hundreds of arrests of violent offenders last year without resorting to shooting. \"This is not sustainable.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans in Washington DC and elsewhere have expressed growing unease with how the administration was handling the situation. Vermont Governor Phil Scott called the federal efforts in Minnesota \"a complete failure of coordination of acceptable public safety and law enforcement practices, training and leadership\" – at best.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At worst, he said, it was \"deliberate federal intimidation and incitement of American citizens\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Utah Senator John Curtis criticised Noem's \"premature\" response to the shooting, which he said \"came before all the facts were known and weakened confidence\" in the law enforcement mission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Homeland security chairmen in both the House and Senate say they plan to hold public hearings</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Sunday night, there has been a marked change in tone from the White House. Veteran's Affairs Secretary Doug Collins offered condolences to the Pretti family. The president posted a message on his Truth Social website calling the death \"tragic\" and blaming it on \"Democrat ensued chaos\" – a message echoed by Vice-President JD Vance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday morning, Trump posted that he was dispatching \"border czar\" Tom Homan to Minnesota to direct law-enforcement efforts there. Homan, who handled deportations during Democrat Barack Obama's administration, is considered a more measured, politically attuned operator less prone to the kind of bombastic declarations recently made by Noem and Bovino.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,\" Trump wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Homan's assignment to Minneapolis may not necessarily reflect a change in policy – this administration has yet to show signs of backing away from its aggressive immigration enforcement – it could be a change in presentation, as the president tries to come to grips with a public mood that opinion surveys suggest is souring on how his immigration crackdown is being carried out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a CBS survey taken before the weekend's shooting, 61% of respondents said that ICE is being \"too tough when stopping and detaining people\", while 58% disapproved of his handling of immigration as a whole.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/17ef/live/1cec83d0-faf1-11f0-adda-0755af0bac4f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA Trump's border czar Tom Homan appears in pensive mood as he hold his hand to his face and stares into the distance in a close-up photo taken in the White House grounds.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">EPA</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump is sending Tom Homan to oversee the immigration operation in Minnesota</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, when asked by BBC News about Homan's involvement, said that he may provide a new avenue to work with the administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't want to foreclose the possibility that reasonable minds can prevail,\" he added, \"but we are here exactly because the federal government had unreasonable positions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another potential thaw came when Trump announced on Monday that he had spoken with Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a very good call,\" Trump wrote. \"We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That represents a marked cooling of what had been a series of heated exchanges between the two men in recent weeks – and could portend the kind of de-escalation in Minnesota that many politicians have been calling for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That may not be enough for Washington Democrats, however, who have come under increasing pressure to draw a bright line against the Trump administration's rhetoric and policy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Senate Democrats have announced they will now block that funding measure in their chamber, which would trigger a partial government shutdown on Friday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am voting against any funding for DHS until and unless more controls are put in place to hold ICE accountable,\" said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. \"These repeated incidents of violence across the country are unlawful, needlessly escalatory and making all of us less safe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such a move is not without its own political risks, however. Democrats triggered a record-setting shutdown last autumn over health care subsidies but ultimately relented with little to show for it. And they will also be wary of pushing too far on immigration and law and order, two issues where they poll poorly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the moment, both Republicans and Democrats are grappling with how to handle what has become an explosive situation. At stake is the public perception of Trump's immigration policy, a core political issue for the president and one that helped him win back the White House.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

He had arrived in New York just a few days before 9/11 from his native Pakistan to study at Columbia. He likened the US to Imperial Rome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you are lucky enough to live within the walls of the imperial citadel, which is to say here in the US, you experience American power as something benign. It protects you and your property. It bestows freedom by upholding the rule of law. It is accountable to the people through democratic institutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But if, like me, you live on the barbarian fringes of Empire, you experience American power as something quite different. It can do anything to you, with impunity... And you can't stop it or hold it to account.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His words made me consider the much heralded rules-based international order from another angle: from the point of view of much of the Global South. And how its benefits have never been universally distributed, something that the Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney reminded an audience at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, last week.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/94d4/live/d6ff4100-f875-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Canadian PM, Mark Carney, wearing a dark suit and blue tie, stands at a microphone in front of a blue backdrop bearing the words World Economic Forum.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech in Davos called for 'the middle powers' to act together</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We knew the story of the international rules-based order was partially false,\" Carney said. \"That the strongest would exempt themselves when convenient.

There were still many living World War Two veterans and thousands of those who had crossed the Channel 60 years earlier came back to the beaches that day - many of them from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They wanted no talk of the heroism or courage of their youth.

But I found myself thinking not so much of the battles they'd fought and the bravery and sacrifices of their younger selves, but of the peace that they'd gone home to build when the fighting was over.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The world they bequeathed to us was immeasurably better than the world they'd inherited from their parents. For they were born into a world of Great Power rivalries, in which, in Mark Carney's words, \"the strong can do what they can, and the weak must suffer what they must\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was the generation that went home to build the rules-based international order, because they had learned the hard way what a system without rules, without laws, can lead to.

I think I did.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For we did not foresee then a world in which trust in traditional sources of news and information would be corroded by a rising cynicism, turbo-charged by social media and, increasingly now, artificial intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In any age of economic stagnation and extremes of inequality, popular trust in democratic institutions corrodes.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the agents fired in self-defence after Pretti, who they say had a handgun, resisted their attempts to disarm him. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eyewitnesses, local officials and the victim's family have challenged that account, pointing out he had a phone in his hand, not a weapon. His parents accused the administration of spreading \"sickening lies\" about what happened. \"Please get the truth out about our son,\" they added. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident, which came two weeks after the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by an immigration agent, has led to further protests and renewed calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happened in the moments before the shooting?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shooting occurred on Saturday morning near Nicollet Avenue and 26th Street in south Minneapolis at 9:05 local time (15:05 GMT).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander, said agents had been carrying out a \"targeted\" immigration enforcement operation when Pretti approached agents with a \"9mm semi-automatic\" handgun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bovino did not specify if Pretti was brandishing the gun, but said agents attempted to disarm him and he \"violently resisted\". The commander said a Border Patrol officer then \"fired defensive shots\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos from the moments before the shooting show Pretti filming agents with his phone in the middle of the street. Whistling and shouting can be heard from bystanders in the background. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From one angle, an agent appears to push a woman. When the camera pans back to Pretti, he is seen with his arm around her. The agent then pushes back a second woman. At the same time, Pretti reaches his arm out and stands between her and the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agent then sprays a substance in his eyes. Pretti turns his face away and reaches one open hand up in the air. He appears to be clutching a phone in the other. No gun is visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another video from a different angle shows the agent grabbing Pretti by the arm, before more agents get involved. Pretti is brought to the ground, with at least six agents on top of him.

This year, it will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India has invited them as chief guests for the celebrations, placing the European Union at the centre of one of the country's most prestigious state events.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On this day, India turns the heart of its capital into a stage.

The chief guests have been from leaders of neighbouring countries - such as Bhutan and Sri Lanka - to heads of state and government from major powers, including the US and the UK.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has featured as the chief guest five times - including Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip - reflecting the long and complex history between the two countries.

It was the first time a regional grouping was invited - marking 25 years of India's engagement with the bloc, Pant added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, some absences from the guest list have also reflected strained relationships.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistani leaders attended twice as chief guests before the neighbours went to war in 1965. Islamabad has not been invited thereafter - a sign of continuing strain in ties. The only time China attended was when Marshal Ye Jianying came in 1958, four years before the two countries went to war over their disputed border. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the significance of Republic Day extends beyond diplomacy and guest lists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/408b/live/84379a40-f81a-11f0-8652-4de4e28f2840.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Indian President Abdul Kalam (R), Russian President Vladimir Putin (2R) and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (L) watch Indian army jets flying over India's 58th Republic Day parade from a bullet-proof box, in New Delhi, 26 January 2007. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the Republic Day parade in 2007</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Analysts says India's parade stands apart from similar military displays elsewhere in the world for a number of reasons. The fact that India has a guest almost every year is one of them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also, for most countries, these parades commemorate military victories. Like <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61332283\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Russia's Victory Day</a> marks the defeat of Germany in World War Two, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-36808199\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">France's Bastille Day</a> celebrates the start of the French Revolution and the eventual fall of the monarchy, and China's military parade marks their victory over Japan in World War Two. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's celebration, by contrast, is centred on the constitution, says Pant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many other countries, these celebrations are related to victories in war. We don't celebrate that. We celebrate becoming a constitutional democracy - the coming into effect of the constitution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike military parades in many Western capitals, India's Republic Day also blends displays of its military capability with cultural performances and regional tableaux, projecting both power and diversity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beyond strategy and symbolism, the parade often leaves a more personal impression on visiting leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The former official who spoke anonymously recalled how the Obamas were particularly struck by the camel-mounted contingents - a moment that stayed with them long after the formal ceremonies ended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It says it is also currently investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people were killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest videos to emerge from the country are understood to have been filmed on 8 and 9 January, when thousands of people took to the streets following a call for nationwide protests from Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late Shah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They are thought to be the deadliest nights for protesters so far and these newly verified videos show how Iran's security forces have been violently cracking down on protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple clips analysed by BBC Verify and BBC Persian show bodies piled up inside a mortuary at Tehranpars hospital in east Tehran. We verified the location of the hospital by matching its interior to other publicly available images and videos of the building, and counted at least 31 bodies in just one video. Another clip shows seven body bags laid on the ground outside the hospital's entrance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hundreds of people are seen protesting on a highway in west Tehran in another video before multiple rounds of gunfire can be heard and people begin to scream. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Protesters have also been seen trying to evade Iran's heavy surveillance infrastructure by disabling CCTV cameras. Footage we verified shows one person in the capital climbing up a post and hitting a surveillance camera several times in an attempt to disable it. A huge crowd of protesters can be seen on the ground and heard cheering as the camera is damaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We have tracked the spread of the anti-government protests across 71 towns and cities in Iran, though the true number of areas where demonstrations have taken place is likely far higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the south-eastern city of Kerman a video taken from high up in a building shows several armed men in military uniform walking down a road firing their weapons continuously, though it is not clear who they are shooting at. A small fire burns in the middle of the road while the sound of protesters chanting can be heard in the background.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Snipers have also been recorded on the roofs of buildings. In the north-eastern city of Mashhad verified video shows two men dressed in black on a rooftop of a building in daylight. One man is standing next to a large rifle that is leant against a wall and speaking on the phone. The other man crouches on the floor while smoking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For most people there has been an almost-total internet blackout since 8 January, but some have managed to briefly access the internet using methods such as SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet and virtual private networks (VPNs).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More videos are likely to emerge in the coming days as the country's economy has struggled during the blackout.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-bbc-persian.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting BBC Persian.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"
