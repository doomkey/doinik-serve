Once it has been in place for 72 hours, 18 Cambodian soldiers held by Thailand since July will be released, the statement said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The breakthrough came after days of talks between the two countries, with diplomatic encouragement from China and the US.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agreement prioritises getting the displaced back to their homes, and also includes an agreement to remove landmines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand's Defence Minister Natthaphon Narkphanit described the ceasefire as a test for the \"other party's sincerity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Should the ceasefire fail to materialise or be violated, Thailand retains its legitimate right to self-defence under international law,\" he told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN human rights chief Volker Türk said he hopes the ceasefire will \"pave the way\" for peace, while an EU spokesperson urged \"good faith\" in its implementation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand had been reluctant to accept the ceasefire, saying the last one was not properly implemented. They also resented what they saw as Cambodia's efforts to internationalise the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike the last ceasefire in July, US President Donald Trump was conspicuously absent from this one, although the US State Department was involved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That ceasefire agreement collapsed <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7l0rjz05eo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">earlier this month</a>, when fresh clashes erupted. Both sides blamed each other for the breakdown of the truce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai army said its troops had responded to Cambodian fire in Thailand's Si Sa Ket province, in which two Thai soldiers were injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia's defence ministry said it was Thai forces that had attacked first, in Preah Vihear province, and insisted that Cambodia did not retaliate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Clashes have continued throughout December. On Friday, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gk15x85jlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Thailand carried out more air strikes inside Cambodia</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Thai Air Force said it had hit a Cambodian \"fortified military position\" after civilians had left the area. Cambodia's defence ministry said the strikes were \"indiscriminate attacks\" against civilian houses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How well the ceasefire holds this time depends to a large extent on political will. Nationalist sentiment has been inflamed in both countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cambodia, in particular, has lost many soldiers and a lot of its military equipment. It has been driven back from positions it held on the border, and suffered extensive damage from the Thai air strikes, grievances which could make a lasting peace harder to achieve.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Disagreement over the border dates back more than a century, but tension increased early this year after a group of Cambodian women sang patriotic songs in a disputed temple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash in May, and two months later, in July, there were five days of intense fighting along the border, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead. Thousands more civilians were displaced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following intervention by Malaysia and President Trump, a fragile ceasefire was negotiated between the two countries, and signed in late October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump dubbed the agreement the \"Kuala Lumpur Peace Accords\". It mandated both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the disputed region, and to establish an interim observer team to monitor it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the agreement was suspended by Thailand in November after Thai soldiers were injured by landmines, with Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul announcing that the security threat had \"not actually decreased\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

The most popular party, the National League for Democracy, has been dissolved, and its leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is locked up in an undisclosed prison. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Voting, which will happen in three stages over a period of a month, will not even be possible in large parts of the country still consumed by war.

They might say the wrong thing, one man explained – they don't know how to speak to journalists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of plain-clothes military intelligence officers present there helps explain their nervousness. In a dictatorship which has criminalised liking Facebook pages criticising the election, or using the word revolution, even these staunchly pro-military party activists feared the consequences of allowing a foreign journalist the chance to ask uncensored questions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same fear lingers on the streets of Mandalay.

The fish seller shooed us away. \"You will bring me trouble,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only one woman was brave enough to speak frankly, but we needed to find a private place to meet, and to conceal her identity, just to hear her view of the election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This election is a lie,\" she said. \"Everyone is afraid.

It is likely to be reluctantly accepted in the rest of Asia too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His army, newly equipped with Chinese and Russian weapons, has been regaining ground lost over the past two years to the various armed groups opposing the coup. He is clearly hoping to include more reconquered territory in the third stage of the election at the end of January.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD out of the picture his USDP is all but guaranteed to win. In the last, free election in 2020, the USDP won only six percent of parliamentary seats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some observers have noted that Min Aung Hlaing is not popular even within his own regime, or his own party, where his leadership qualities are questioned. He will probably keep the presidency after the election, but his power will, to some extent, be diluted by the resumption of parliamentary politics, albeit without most of the parties that won seats in the 2020 election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The election is clearly viewed by China as an off-ramp, a way for the military to get out of the destructive deadlock caused by its ill-judged coup.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'No-one is ready to compromise'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even a short distance from the apparently peaceful city life of Mandalay, the deep scars left by Myanmar's civil war, which is still far from over, are visible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the opposite side of the Irrawaddy River lies the spectacular temple complex at Mingun, once a popular tourist attraction. Getting there requires a short drive along a riverside road, but for the past four years this, like much of the area around Mandalay, has been contested territory, where volunteer People's Defence Forces control many villages and launch ambushes against army convoys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To reach Mingun we needed to get through several checkpoints. We sat in a tea shop with the local police commander to negotiate our passage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was a young man, wearing the huge strain of his job on his face.

The jail terms run concurrently under Malaysian law. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the court rejected his application to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the former prime minister retains a loyal base of supporters, who claim that he's a victim of unfair rulings and who have showed up at his trials calling for his release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, dozens of people gathered outside the court in Putrajaya in support of Najib.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 1MDB scandal made headlines across the world when it came to light a decade ago, embroiling prominent figures from Malaysia to Goldman Sachs and Hollywood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators estimated that $4.5bn was siphoned from the state-owned wealth fund into private pockets, including Najib's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Najib's lawyers claim that he had been misled by his advisers - in particular the financier Jho Low, who<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>has maintained his innocence but remains at large.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the argument has not convinced Malaysia's courts, which previously found Najib <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-53563065\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">guilty of embezzlement in 2020.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That year, Najib was convicted of abuse of power, money laundering and breach of trust over 42 million ringgit ($10m; £7.7m) transferred from SRC International - a former unit of 1MDB - into his private accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was sentenced to 12 years in prison, but saw his jail term <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68137595\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">halved last year</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest case concerns a larger sum of money, also tied to 1MDB, received by his personal bank account in 2013.

She is free on bail pending an appeal against her conviction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The scandal has had profound repercussions on Malaysian politics. In 2018 it led to a historic election loss for Najib's Barisan Nasional coalition, which had governed the country since its independence in 1957.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, the recent verdicts has highlighted fissures in Malaysia's ruling coalition, which includes Najib's party United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Najib's failed house arrest bid on Monday was met with disappointment from his allies but celebrated by his critics within the same coalition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called for politicians on all sides to respect the court's decisions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Malaysian lawmaker Tony Pua told the BBC's Newsday programme that the verdict would \"send a message\" to the country's leaders, that \"you can get caught for corruption even if you're number one in the country like the prime minister\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Cynthia Gabriel,  founding director of Malaysia's Center to Combat Corruption and Cronyism, argued that the country has made little headway in anti-corruption efforts despite the years of reckoning after the 1MDB scandal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Public institutions have not been strengthened enough to reassure Malaysians that \"the politicians they put into power would actually serve their interests\" instead of \"their own pockets\", she told Newsday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Grand corruption continues in different forms\", she added. \"We don't know at all if another 1MDB could occur, or may have already occurred.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

The abduction was captured on CCTV and gripped the nation for years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The high court ruled that the elite Special Branch of the police had taken Raymond Koh, and held both the police and the Malaysian government responsible for the country's first-ever enforced disappearance case to be heard in a court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For years Ms Liew fought to find out what happened to her husband, transforming from an ordinary pastor's wife to a fierce campaigner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She may never know for sure why her husband was taken, but two independent official investigations found that the police saw the pastor as a threat to Islam, Malaysia's majority religion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to the BBC shortly after her court victory, Ms Liew said she was driven to pursue justice. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A voice [inside me] said… 'So they took him in secret - I will let the whole world know'.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: CCTV captures moment pastor Raymond Koh is abducted</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 13 February 2017, shortly after 10am, Mr Koh left his family home to meet friends. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the 63-year-old drove out of his house in a quiet Kuala Lumpur suburb, a convoy of SUVs and motorcycles roared up to his vehicle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Masked men in black clothing sprang out. Glass shards flew everywhere as they smashed a window of Mr Koh's car and dragged out the pastor. They bundled him into one of their vehicles and drove off, taking his car with them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The abduction took place in seconds. It was so dramatic that one eyewitness driving behind Mr Koh later testified that he thought it was a movie shoot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the following days Mr Koh's children went door to door looking for clues to their father's disappearance - and discovered that two homes' CCTV cameras had captured the entire incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Watching the footage, the family realised it was no ordinary abduction. It was meticulous and well-co-ordinated. They had also not received any ransom note or been contacted by kidnappers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few months before, in November 2016, an activist named Amri Che Mat from the northern state of Perlis had been abducted in almost exactly the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Koh's family went to the media, and the CCTV footage instantly went viral when it was published online by a local newspaper. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The public demanded answers, and Malaysia's human rights commission - an independent body set up by parliament - launched an investigation. Later, there was also a separate investigation by the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many speculated that the Special Branch was responsible. But the police denied involvement, its chief telling the public to \"please shut up\" so they could investigate the disappearance in peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Months later, after conducting their investigations, the police claimed a drug trafficking ring had taken Mr Koh. Separately, they arrested an Uber driver for kidnapping him - a charge that was eventually dropped.

Instead, on the night she reported her husband's disappearance, she said she was questioned for five hours about whether Mr Koh had tried to convert Muslims to Christianity. \"I was very traumatised.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her interrogator later testified during the rights commission's investigation hearing that he had been instructed by his supervisors to pursue this line of inquiry because Mr Koh was a pastor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2011 Mr Koh had been accused of apostasy - a crime in Muslim-majority Malaysia - when he organised a party at a church which some Muslims also attended. He was investigated by Islamic authorities but no action was taken. He and his family have always denied that he was trying to convert Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the years after Mr Koh's disappearance, Ms Liew said, she felt that \"the police were not forthcoming with their investigation and even, at times, they were hindering us from finding out the truth and produced red herrings\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The family has long maintained the police's theories were attempts to cover up their role in his abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the Malaysian police for a response to these allegations. They have yet to reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the search for answers dragged on, everyone in the family began experiencing depression, Ms Liew said. She still suffers from panic attacks and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, there was a breakthrough.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The car and the confession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Late one night in May 2018, a man showed up at the house of Norhayati, the wife of Amri Che Mat, the<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>activist who had been abducted in 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Identifying himself as a police sergeant, he<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>delivered shocking information: the Special Branch had indeed kidnapped her husband and Raymond Koh.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police believed Mr Koh was trying to convert Muslims to Christianity, he said, and that Amri Che Mat was spreading Shia Islam, which is banned in Sunni-dominant Malaysia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The police sergeant said he wanted to tell Ms Norhayati what happened, as he felt what the Special Branch did was wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati's account of this confession was investigated by the human rights commission and eventually ruled as credible. While the sergeant later denied he made the confession, the commission found his denial to be full of inconsistencies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, there was the gold-coloured car.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A witness to Mr Koh's abduction recalled seeing a gold-coloured Toyota Vios - a similar car was spotted near Amri Che Mat's house prior to his disappearance. The police sergeant also mentioned a gold-coloured car's presence in both abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators for the rights commission traced that car to a man in Kuala Lumpur who worked for the Special Branch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In April 2019, the commission concluded the Special Branch was responsible for the abductions of Raymond Koh and Amri Che Mat. It said the two men were \"targeted by religious authorities and the police over allegations that they were involved in matters against Islam in Malaysia\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report stunned the Malaysian public, with some demanding accountability. Months later, the government launched its own investigation, which was made public only after Ms Liew and Ms Norhayati sued for access.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's investigation came to a similar conclusion, blaming \"irresponsible rogue cops\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its report also named a \"main person of interest\" - a senior Special Branch official, Awaludin bin Jadid, who headed the unit tackling social extremism. It noted he had \"extreme views\" against Shia Islam and Christianity and, in public speeches, portrayed them as threats to Islam.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Awaludin, who is now retired, for his response to these findings. We have yet to receive a reply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Awaludin previously denied he had anything to do with Amri Che Mat's disappearance, and also alleged the government task force that produced the report was \"biased\" against him.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33d7/live/c278efb0-bee1-11f0-9887-cf2146e0a498.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"US Department of State Susanna Liew is wearing an elaborate red and yellow embroidered jacket and holds up a glass trophy, smiling slightly, as she stands on stage between Melania Trump who is wearing a black dress and Mike Pompeo who is wearing a black suit and gold tie.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of State</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ms Liew received a medal from Melania Trump and Mike Pompeo in 2020</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2020, Ms Liew launched a civil lawsuit on behalf of herself and her missing husband against several top police officers, the Royal Malaysian Police and the Malaysian government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She held them responsible for the forcible disappearance of Mr Koh - which is the abduction and concealment of his whereabouts  - and demanded they reveal his location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, a High Court judge found that among the named police officials and the Royal Malaysian Police, \"one or more\" of them were responsible for Raymond Koh's abduction and a \"conspiracy resulting in harm\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since these were public officials acting under the state's authority, \"the government must answer for the resulting harm\" and thus was \"vicariously liable\", the judge said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Besides awarding several million ringgit to Ms Liew for emotional distress, the judge ordered that 10,000 ringgit (£1,830; $2,385) be paid to a trust for each day of Mr Koh's disappearance until his whereabouts are disclosed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To date this sum has surpassed 32m ringgit, and the final figure is expected to be the largest payout in Malaysian history. The trust's money, which will be paid out only once Mr Koh's whereabouts are disclosed, will likely go to Ms Liew and her children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Norhayati, who also launched a lawsuit, won her case and received several million ringgit in compensation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the government is appealing against these verdicts, arguing there are \"issues related to financial obligations\" and that it needs to \"uphold the principle of universal justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also said the police are continuing to investigate the abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has asked the police for comment on the verdict.

But right now, we are in a limbo. We don't know - is he dead or alive? - and this takes a toll on us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Liew choked up at the thought that her husband may be dead. \"It's going to be very hard to accept that,\" she said, adding she \"wants to hope\" that her husband is alive.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"We are frozen in grief,\" says Koh's wife, Susanna Liew</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But time is helping the family to heal. Inspired by counsellors who helped her through her depression, Ms Liew has been training to become one herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Telling her story has also been a \"catharsis\", she said. Over the years, as she travelled the world to raise awareness of her husband's case, she became an outspoken critic of enforced disappearances. In 2020 the US awarded her an International Women of Courage medal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I never expected that I would be at this place.

I was angry with them\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But I noticed that when I came face to face with the main suspect - I felt no hatred… I want to be really right and pure before God, and not have any shadow or darkness in my life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Forgiveness, however, does not mean she will stop her<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>pursuit of justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is now calling for the authorities to set up a disciplinary body to monitor police conduct, as well as a commission of inquiry and a task force to track down every single person involved in her husband's abduction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now, none of the police officials named in her lawsuit have been arrested or punished. One of them has been promoted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we really want is for the truth and justice to prevail, for the perpetrators to be brought to justice, and for us to have good closure,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That means, we want to know where Pastor Raymond is.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

This has provoked a boycott by much, though not all, of the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet, contrary to widespread expectations, his most prominent electoral rival, Anicet-Georges Dologuélé, has been allowed to take part in the electoral race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This contrasts with the situation in Guinea, on Africa's west coast, where Gen Mamadi Doumbouya, leader of the September 2021 coup that deposed the 83-year old civilian President Alpha Condé, is now preparing to convert himself into a constitutionally elected ruler.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although Doumbouya will face eight challengers at the ballot box, he has dominated the campaign, with his image plastered all over the streets of Conakry, Guinea's capital city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most prominent opposition figure of the past 10 years, Cellou Dalein Diallo, with a big personal following among the large Peul community who account for about 40% of the electorate, has been excluded from the contest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite these constraints on the political choice presented to voters, the return of an elected government will come as a great relief to the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas), a regional bloc that promotes economic integration, democracy, and military cooperation among its members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost a year ago, it suffered a blow with the withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger after the military regimes that had seized power in a wave of coups between 2020 and 2023 refused to comply with the bloc's demands to commit to clear timeframes for the restoration of civilian rule.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9fa7/live/dae6f4f0-e02b-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images A composite image of two pictures of Gen Mamadi Doumbouya.

Officials in Conakry praise the French Development Agency as one of their most supportive partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indeed, from the outset, the Doumbouya regime has been treated rather gently by both France and the West generally, and by Ecowas, despite a troubling human rights record.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His overthrow of Condé -

Her hands sometimes pass through what she's holding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's because Gigi isn't real. She's the AI creation of University of Illinois student Simone Mckenzie - who needed to make some money over the summer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie, 21, is part of a fast-growing cohort of digital creators who churn out a stream of videos by entering simple prompts into AI chatbots, like Google Veo 3. Experts say this genre, dubbed \"AI slop\" by some critics and begrudging viewers, is taking over social media feeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And its creators are finding considerable success.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One video made me $1,600 [£1,185] in just four days,\" Ms Mckenzie said. \"I was like, okay, let me keep doing this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After two months, Gigi had millions of views, making Ms Mckenzie thousands through TikTok's creator fund, a programme that pays creators based on how many views they get. But she's far from the only person using AI to reach easy virality, experts said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's surging right now and it's probably going to continue,\" said Jessa Lingel, associate professor and digital culture expert at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its progenitors - who now can generate videos of literally anything in just a few minutes - have the potential to disrupt the lucrative influencer economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But while some say AI is ruining social media, others see its potential to democratise who gains fame online, Lingel said. Those who don't have the money or time for a fancy background, camera setup or video editing tools can now go viral, too.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c4e3/live/a4e6c860-e032-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Simone Mckenzie/Google Veo 3 A young woman, wearing a purple tanktop and a long, black ponytail sits in front of a softly lit background while eating a cookie\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Simone Mckenzie/Google Veo 3</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Part of the prompt McKenzie used to create her most viral video of Gigi</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Traditional influencers being pushed out?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media influencing only recently became a legitimate career path. But in just a few years, the industry has grown to be worth over $250bn, according to investment firm Goldman Sachs. Online creators often use their own lives - their vacations, their pets, their makeup routines - to make content and attract a following.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI creators who can make the same thing - only faster, cheaper and without the constraints of reality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It certainly has the potential to upset the creator space,\" said Brooke Duffy, a digital and social media scholar at Cornell University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie, creator of Gigi, said videos take her only a few minutes to generate and she sometimes posts three per day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's not feasible for human influencers like Kaaviya Sambasivam, 26, who has  around 1.3 million followers across multiple platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Depending on the kind of video she's making - whether it's a recipe, a day-in-my life vlog, or a makeup tutorial - it may take anywhere from a few hours to a few days to fully produce. She has to shop, plan, set up her background and lighting, shoot and then edit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI creators can skip nearly all of those steps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It bears the question: is this going to be something that we can out compete? Because I am a human. My output is limited,\" Ms Sambasivam, based in North Carolina, said. \"There are months where I will be down in the dumps, and I'll post just the bare minimum. I can't compete with robots.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She started building her channel while living with her parents during the Covid pandemic. Without a set-up, she said she duct-taped her phone to the wall to film. Eventually, she spent money she made as an influencer buying tripods, lighting, makeup and food for her videos. It took years to build her following.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Mckenzie said she considered being a more traditional influencer, but didn't have the money, time or setup. That's why she created Gigi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My desk at home has a lot of books and stuff,\" she said. \"It's not the most visually appealing. It definitely makes it easier that you can just pick whatever background you want with AI.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3260/live/f0b704a0-ca3c-11f0-86f6-7b854e603852.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Kaaviya Sambasivam Sambasivam wears a black top and gold earrings while standing in front of the ocean\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Kaaviya Sambasivam</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kaaviya Sambasivam</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">\"Real\" life on AI videos</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Ms Mckenzie started, she turned to Google's Veo 3 chatbot, asking it to generate a woman - someone to stand in as her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gigi is her age, 21, with tanned skin, green eyes, freckles, winged eyeliner and long black hair. She then asked the chatbot to make Gigi talk. Gigi now starts each video chiding commentators who accuse her of being AI. Then, mockingly proving them right, she eats a bedazzled avocado or a cookie made of slime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Duffy said digital alterations aren't new. First, there were programs like Photoshop, used for image editing. Next, apps like FaceTune made it easier for users to change their faces for social media. But she said the main precursor to today's hyper-realistic AI videos were celebrity deepfakes, emerging in the late 2010s.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they now look much, much more real, Ms Duffy said, and they can spread faster.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">AI videos run the gamut from the absurd - a cartoon of a cat working at McDonald's - to the hyper-realistic, like fake doorbell camera footage. They represent every genre - horror, comedy, culinary. But none of it is real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's become, in some ways, a form of meme culture,\" Ms Duffy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One 31-year-old American woman living in South Korea has a TikTok page dedicated to an AI-generated puppy, Gamja, who wears headphones, cooks and curls his hair. She's received millions of views as well as partnerships from companies who want to be featured in her videos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wanted to blend things that people love, which include food and puppies, in a way that hadn't been done before,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the biggest AI content creators on TikTok is 27-year-old Daniel Riley. He has an audience of millions, but they have never seen his face. Rather, his \"time travel\" videos have earned him nearly 600,000 subscribers and tens of millions of views.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"POV: you wake up in Pompeii on eruption day\" and \"POV: you wake up as Queen Cleopatra\" are some of his most popular titles, taking viewers through a 30-second-long fictionalised day in ancient history.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I realised I could tell stories that would normally cost millions to produce and give people a look into different eras through their phone,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he's developed another stream of income - a bootcamp to teach others how to make similar AI videos for a monthly fee.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Will anyone know the difference?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Stop calling me AI,\" Gigi says at the beginning of each TikTok. She's arguing with sceptics' - but some audience members unquestioningly believe she's real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On one hand, AI videos that are almost indistinguishable from reality pose a real problem,  Ms Lingel said, especially for young kids who don't yet have media literacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it'll be almost impossible for an ordinary human to tell the difference soon,\" she said. \"You're going to see a rise in misinformation, you're going to see a rise in scams, you're going to see a rise in content that's just…crappy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other, AI videos can be mesmerising, experts said, offering cartoonish, exaggerated material.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's those images and posts that seem to toe the line between reality and duplicity that capture our attention and encourage us to share,\" Ms Duffy said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Harvard University study indicated that among AI users between the ages of 14-22, many say they use it to generate things like images and music.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, she said, the question is if human discernment can keep up with rapidly improving technology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Almost every day, the creator of Gamja said she hears from people online, worried about her AI-generated puppy: they think he's eating foods that are unhealthy, they say - because they think they're watching a real dog.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

norms \"regardless of geopolitical circumstances.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior archaeologist from the museum told the BBC that Butyagin had followed the only path available for Russian archaeologists working in Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A Russian archaeologist, if he wants to continue his research, has no opportunity to obtain permits from the Ukrainian side, but must obtain them from the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation,\" said the scholar who spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to comment on the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Ukrainian sources have also accused Butyagin of \"looting\" objects by taking them to Russia, although these charges are not part of Ukraine's case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both the archaeologist and the Hermitage insist all their finds remain in Crimea as they are transferred to the Eastern Crimean Museum in Kerch. They argue that objects can only be relocated to Russia temporarily for restoration or as exhibition loans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, this violates Ukrainian law too, as all discoveries must go into Ukraine's museum fund. Under the terms of Russia's illegal annexation, the Eastern Crimean Museum collection has instead been made part of Russia's museum fund.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the start of the war, several European courts have refused Ukraine's requests to extradite Russians, citing potential risks under the European Convention, which prohibits politically motivated persecution, violations of the right to a fair trial, and torture and inhuman treatment of detainees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even if the Polish court deciding Butyagin's case does find sufficient grounds to extradite him, it might not go ahead, says Gleb Bogush, a researcher at the Institute for International Peace and Security Law at the University of Cologne.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last June, Denmark's Supreme Court ruled against extraditing to Ukraine a Russian national suspected of espionage for Moscow.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gleb Bogush says it is primarily the Russian state and its officials that are responsible for Crimean excavations, rather than Butyagin, because it was not up to archaeologists to decide whether the Hermitage expedition should continue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A senior Hermitage employee told the BBC that \"a field archaeologist cannot be a citizen of the world; he deals with officials, obtaining permits and has to look for funding and volunteers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Butyagin has attracted support not just from the Kremlin but from Russians who oppose Putin and the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The claims being made against him are absurd,\" said Arseny Vesnin, an exiled journalist and historian. He said Butyagin had ensured conservation and preservation of the site he was excavating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others maintain that artefacts would have been looted by criminals and sold on the black market if Russian archaeologists had refused to work in Crimea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That does not justify their actions, says Samuel Andrew Hardy, a leading British criminologist specialising in the protection of cultural property in conflict zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Official excavations do not always stop criminal digs from taking place, he argues. Some looters target sites that have already been excavated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hardy says all that Butyagin's supporters are doing is arguing that ultimately Russia should just be allowed to carry on doing what it wants regardless of the war.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But without a plan to manage the waste it will generate, how clean is the transition?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In just over a decade, India has become the world's third-largest solar producer, with renewables now central to its climate strategy. Solar panels are everywhere - from vast solar parks to blue rooftops across cities, towns and villages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alongside large solar parks, millions of rooftop systems now feed power into the electricity grid. Government data show nearly 2.4 million households have adopted solar under a subsidy scheme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar growth has cut India's reliance on coal. Though thermal and other non-renewables still supply over half of installed capacity, solar now contributes more than 20%. Yet the achievement carries a challenge: while clean in use, solar panels can pose environmental risks if not properly managed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels are mostly recyclable, made of glass, aluminium, silver, and polymers - but trace toxic metals like lead and cadmium can pollute soil and water if mishandled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar panels typically last about 25 years, after which they are removed and discarded. India currently has no dedicated budget for solar-waste recycling and only a few small facilities to process old panels.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3f57/live/3428bf80-e095-11f0-a1ce-b7a166f167b0.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A cooling tower and chimneys at the NLC Tamil Nadu Power Ltd.

For now, the volume is small, but experts warn the bulk is yet to come - and without rapid recycling investment, India could face a growing waste crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new study by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) estimates that India could generate more than <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/ceew-how-big-is-the-solar-module-recycling-industry-in-india.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">11 million tonnes of solar waste</a> by 2047.

China's system, like India's, is still developing and lacks a dedicated regulatory framework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, India brought solar panels under e-waste rules, making manufacturers responsible for collecting, storing, dismantling and recycling them at end of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say enforcement is uneven, especially for home and small-scale panels, which make up 5–10% of installations. Though modest, these panels can still generate substantial waste, as they are harder to track, collect, and recycle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Damaged or discarded panels often end up in landfills or with unauthorised recyclers, where unsafe methods can release toxic materials.

The new law specifically states that redactions can only be done to protect the identity of victims or active criminal investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump's name appeared more in these new documents than in previous releases. Many were media clippings that mention him, but one notable email from a federal prosecutor indicated that Trump flew on Epstein's jet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DoJ has said that some files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims\" about Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not indicate wrongdoing. The BBC has requested comment from individuals named in our reporting.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emails between 'A' and Maxwell about 'girls'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of the thousands of pages included in this latest release, one 2001 email sent by a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm28g5exx09o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">person identified as \"A\"</a> stands out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The message, to Epstein's accomplice and close associate Ghislaine Maxwell, says that \"A\" is at \"Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A\" then asks Maxwell, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022 for sex trafficking of minors and other offences: \"Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another email sent later that day, Maxwell writes back: \"So sorry to dissapoint [sic] you, however the truth must be told. I have only been able to find appropriate friends.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The \"A\" email was sent from the address abx17@dial.pipex.com, with the sender's name shown as \"The Invisible Man\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An image from a prior Epstein files release showed a different, but similar, email - aace@dial.pipex.com - listed in Epstein's phone book under a contact titled \"Duke of York\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another exchange in the new files between Maxwell and \"The Invisible Man\" discusses a trip to Peru.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, and said he did not \"see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his [Epstein's] arrest and conviction\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted his team for a response.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">FBI email suggests 10 possible 'co-conspirators'</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/087f/live/81fcd950-e05c-11f0-9159-192719f5c187.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"US Department of Justice An undated photo released by the US justice department shows Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell seated close together outside a wooden home, appearing to be a cabin of some kind in a wooded area\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">US Department of Justice</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The name of Ghislaine Maxwell (R) is one of two names not redacted on an FBI list</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the documents released are emails appearing to be sent between FBI personnel in 2019 that mention 10 possible \"co-conspirators\" of Epstein.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The emails said six of the group had been served with subpoenas. This included three in Florida, one in Boston, one in New York City, and one in Connecticut.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Four subpoenas were yet to be served when the emails were sent, including to one \"wealthy businessman in Ohio\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another email sent to FBI New York gives an update on the co-conspirators. This time it appears to mention multiple names. Most are redacted from the file.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two names were not redacted – (Ghislaine) Maxwell and Wexner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An email says, \"I do not know about Ohio contacting Wexner\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The email is presumably referring to Former Victoria's Secret CEO Les Wexner, who had a public friendship with Epstein. In 2019, Wexner said he was \"embarrassed\" by his ties to the financier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lawyers for Wexner told BBC News that \"the assistant US attorney in charge of the Epstein investigation stated at the time that Mr Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Mr Wexner cooperated fully by providing background information on Epstein and was never contacted again,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Possible co-conspirators in Epstein's crimes are a major focus for his victims, and for several lawmakers who have demanded more transparency from the DoJ.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's 10 co-conspirators, potentially, that we knew nothing about, that the DoJ had been investigating,\" Democratic Congressman Suhas Subramanyam told BBC News on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Subramanyam, who sits on the House Oversight Committee, added that he was also \"concerned\" over the level of redactions that seem to protect names of lawyers and people who are not victims. Lawmakers in both parties have said they are examining legal options to force more transparency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law passed by Congress and signed last month by Trump states that names and information that might be embarrassing or cause \"reputational harm\" are not allowed to be redacted. It specifically asks the DoJ for internal communications and memos detailing who was investigated and decisions on whether \"to charge, not charge, investigate, or decline to investigate Epstein or his associates\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">DoJ says alleged Epstein letter to Nassar is fake</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fe7/live/55e2efb0-e040-11f0-a9a2-693a1a1aa5e1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Larry Nassar from the shoulders up, wearing square framed glasses with wire rims and orange jumpsuit, looks off to his left\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Larry Nassar</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter included in the released batch of documents has gained plenty of attention online. But, according to the DoJ, it is fake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The handwritten letter and envelope appeared to show Epstein writing to Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who is serving decades in prison for sexually abusing young female athletes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you know by now I have taken the 'short route' home. Good luck!\" the text reads. \"We shared one thing…our love &amp; caring for young ladies and the hope they'd reach their full potential.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The writer signs the letter off: \"Life is unfair, Yours, J Epstein.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The letter had been deemed undeliverable, and was sent - apparently as a return - to the Manhattan jail in which Epstein was detained before his death in 2019. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The released documents show that the FBI was alerted to the letter and requested an analysis of it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the letter's release on Tuesday, the DoJ called the document a fake, noting several irregularities with the note and the envelope that held it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The writing does not appear to match Jeffrey Epstein's,\" the justice department wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The return address did not list the jail where Epstein was held and did not include his inmate number, which is required for outgoing mail,\" the DoJ added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials pointed out the envelope bore a postmark from northern Virginia - noting that Epstein was detained in New York.

With members of the media dynasty spread across the globe, full family gatherings were rare, although in 2008, according to biographer Michael Wolff, the Murdochs spent the festive season together on a flotilla of private yachts. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more often in recent years it was Rupert - for many decades the most influential media titan in the world - and his daughter Elisabeth who would make time for each other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She would certainly have room this year to host her father at the luxurious home she has renovated on the edge of the Cotswolds. But after a bruising closed-court battle in Nevada that became public and an eventual agreement that shut Elisabeth and two of her siblings out of the family firm for good, relations are likely still too strained for even the Murdoch family peacemaker to suggest communal tree-decorating.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cba3/live/7fa23580-d9cf-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WireImage Rupert Murdoch (R) and daughter Elisabeth Murdoch attend the Cheltenham Festival \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WireImage</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Elisabeth Murdoch and two of her siblings, James and Prudence, have been cut out of the family firm</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rupert's eldest child by his second wife, Elisabeth is the co-founder and executive chairman of the production company, Sister, which is behind hit television series, including Black Doves, The Split and This is Going To Hurt. In my experience, she is generous, intelligent and hard-working.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Friends are fiercely loyal and protective of her privacy. Nobody I have spoken to has a bad word to say about her. Many acknowledge, though, that it has been an incredibly testing year on the family front - even if Elisabeth, her younger brother, James, and elder half-sister, Prudence, are each around a billion dollars richer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Money doesn't compensate for a father who, in his mid-90s, decided to rip his family apart because he believed it was in the interests of his business. The Murdochs have never been a traditional family - one reason why their story is said to have inspired the power struggles and backstabbing in the acclaimed TV drama, Succession. But this time, the schism feels more permanent. And as one person put it to me, the TV show concluded too early by killing off Logan Roy: there was more drama to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'James and Rupert will never patch up differences'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">James Murdoch's relationship with his father and older brother Lachlan appears irreconcilable.

They are at the heart of the cabinet too, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon holding key offices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the issue of immigration has become a faultline between Church leadership and the government, as well as amongst parishioners themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When cardinals gathered at the papal conclave in May, Romero had hoped for a \"Trump-like Pope,\" with a similar outlook to the president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Pope Leo XIV has spoken repeatedly about his concerns over how migrants are treated in the US, calling for \"deep reflection\" on the matter in November. The pontiff evoked the gospel of Matthew, adding that \"Jesus says very clearly, at the end of the world, we're going to be asked, 'How did you receive the foreigner?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A week later the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), issued a rare \"Special Message\" voicing their \"concern for the evolving situation impacting immigrants in the United States\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bishops said they were \"disturbed\" at what they called \"a climate of fear and anxiety\". They added that they \"oppose the indiscriminate mass deportation of people\" and \"pray for an end to dehumanizing rhetoric and violence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a significant intervention, the first time the USCCB had used such a communique in a dozen years.

They want to tell the church to shut up,\" and to confine itself to issues such as abortion, Mr Gibson says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">White House border czar, Tom Homan - himself a Catholic - has said that the Church \"is wrong\", and that its leaders \"need to spend time fixing the Catholic Church\". And in October, the White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected the Chicago born Pope's suggestion that US treatment of immigrants was \"inhuman\" and not in line with \"pro-life\" beliefs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gibson argues that the government's calculation \"is that there are enough American Catholics, especially white American Catholics, who support the Republican Party and Donald Trump, that it's politically beneficial at the end of the day to pick a fight with the Pope. That's an unprecedented calculus.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nearly 60% of white Catholics approve of how Trump is handling immigration, according to a new study by the think tank the Public Religion Research Institute.

Although he has argued that current policy is not at odds with Church teaching, he has also said that there is a responsibility to remember the humanity of people who are in the country illegally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some Catholics say that is not what is currently happening. Jeanne Rattenbury is a parishioner at St Gertrude Catholic Church in Chicago. The city has been a focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Ms Rattenbury took part in a 2,000 strong celebration of Mass outside an ICE detention centre in the Broadview neighbourhood of Chicago. The \"People's Mass\" was one of a series of actions by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership (CSPL). The goal, she says, \"was to bring Communion to people inside, to minister to them, which is something that used to be allowed and is not being allowed\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CSPL has now filed a federal lawsuit alleging it was blocked from providing religious ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am proud to be a Catholic when the Catholic Church, from the Pope to the bishops, are saying immigrants have a right to be treated with respect. They have a right to have their inherent human dignity respected\", Ms Rattenbury says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such is the strength of feeling that a church near Boston has used its Christmas nativity scene to make the point that Jesus was a refugee. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">St Susanna Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts, replaced baby Jesus with a hand-painted notice saying \"ICE was here\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some in the community have complained, and the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston ordered that the display be removed, saying it was divisive and contravened rules on sacred objects. So far, the church has not done so.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many US Catholics maintain conservative positions on issues such as abortion, in line with that of the Church, they are also more likely to see themselves as progressive than white evangelical Christians, who overwhelmingly voted Republican in the last three elections. Around a third of white Catholics on the other hand have consistently voted for the Democratic Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And nearly a third of Catholics in the US were born in other countries. \"This is a church that was built on immigration,\" says David Gibson. \"The Catholic brand in the United States is an immigrant church.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/57b9/live/a0c01a50-d9a9-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A demonstrator holds up a sign saying &quot;Jesus wouldn't do this&quot; during a protest outside the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Broadview, Illinois against the latest US immigration crackdown, on October 10, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Clergy say they have been blocked from giving Eucharist to migrants at an Illinois detention facility</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Inconsistent with the Gospel'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington State, was one of the 216 who supported the USCCB's Special Message. Just five bishops voted against it and three abstained.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a fundamental disagreement of how the church sees immigrants in our parishes, from how the current administration views immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We see a lot more positives in those immigrants.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says he is not arguing for open borders, a point that Pope Leo has also made, but is against \"indiscriminate deportation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The deportations we are seeing of our parishioners and of our people in the United States [are] not surgical, [or] targeted to criminals,\" the bishop says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He estimates that around half of the families in his predominantly Hispanic diocese have someone in their household facing some sort of issue with their immigration status. Priests too are often immigrants themselves, putting the Church in an increasingly tenuous position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson says that more than a third of clergy he has ordained have at some point been on a temporary visa before gaining a green card, a process that in the current climate can feel precarious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have a seminarian in the Chicago area. He's on a T-visa, but [ICE] showed up, and he was afraid that he was going to be picked up,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anybody can have their paperwork revoked, [so] we have our men carrying their papers with them at all times.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bishop Tyson argues that current US policy goes against Catholic teaching.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It should weigh heavily on the consciences of Catholics in public life who support indiscriminate deportation. It is inconsistent with the Gospel of Life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Jesse Romero though, it is US bishops and the Pope who are going against Catholic doctrine. He argues the Catechism - which summarises the teachings of the Church - is clear that immigrants should keep to all laws, including those about whether they should be in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have a large swath of bishops in the Catholic Church of America that have a more modernist, liberal, progressive view of Scripture and theology.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romero says he prays for their conversion. While he accepts the Pope and the bishops as leaders of the faith, \"it doesn't mean that in their private opinions, they're going to get everything right. They're men\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only person that is sinless is Jesus. He's perfect. Everybody else, we've got to pray for each other.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
