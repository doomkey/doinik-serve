Another idea, backed by Belgium, is based on the EU borrowing the money on the international markets, using the EU budget as a guarantee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, that would require a unanimous vote and Hungary's Viktor Orban has made it clear he will not allow any more EU money to help Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Ukraine, the hours ahead are significant and EU leaders have been keen to stress the momentous nature of the loan decision.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We know the urgency.

A European Commission official stressed that was not the case and it would be a matter for the 27 member states at the summit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Slovakia's Robert Fico has also opposed using the Russian assets, if it means the money being used to procure weapons rather than for reconstruction needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the pivotal vote does finally take place, it will require a majority of at least 15 member states making up 65% of Europe's population to go through. Whatever happens, European Council President António Costa has promised not to go over the heads of the Belgians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not going to vote against Belgium,\" he told Belgian public broadcaster RTBF. \"We'll continue to work very intensively with the Belgian government because we don't want to approve something that might not be acceptable for Belgium.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belgium will also be aware that ratings agency Fitch has placed Euroclear on a negative watch, partly because of \"low\" legal risks to its balance sheet from the European Commission's plans to use the Russian assets. Euroclear's chief executive has also warned against the plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to find a way to respond to Belgium's worries,\" the Finnish official added. \"We are on the same side as Belgium.

The oldest victim was 89.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You are Doctor Death, a poisoner, a murderer. You bring shame on all doctors,\" said prosecutors last week. \"You have turned this clinic into a graveyard.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chemicals Péchier added triggered cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients, which required emergency intervention in the operating theatre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was often provided by Péchier himself, who was then able to pose as the patient's saviour.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 12 cases he was unable to intervene, or it was too late, and the patient died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In most of the operations, he was not the primary anaesthetist. It was alleged he came in early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, when things went wrong, he was able to step in after diagnosing the problem and ordering an antidote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier was first placed under investigation eight years ago, when he was suspected of poisoning patients at two clinics in Besançon between 2008 and 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The alert was raised in 2017 after a surfeit of potassium chloride was found in the infusion bag of a woman who had a heart attack while being operated on for a back complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investigators found a pattern of \"serious adverse events\" at the Saint-Vincent private clinic in Besançon. While the national average for fatal heart attacks under anaesthetic was 1 in 100,000, at the clinic it was more than six times that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in most cases nationally, an explanation for the heart attack was subsequently found, whereas at Saint-Vincent the cause remained a mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was also found that the \"serious adverse events\" ceased when Péchier left for a short period to work at another clinic, which itself then saw an uptick. Then when he returned to Saint-Vincent, the emergencies resumed there. When he was disbarred from practising in 2017, the anomaly stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier's first known victim, Sandra Simard, was 36 when she experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in the middle of spine surgery. She survived thanks to intervention by Péchier, although she went into a coma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tests on her infusion bags showed concentrations of potassium 100 times the expected dose and the alarm was sounded with local prosecutors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the 15 weeks of the trial, Péchier sometimes acknowledged that some of the patients who fell ill or died may have been poisoned but he denied any wrongdoing. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I am not a poisoner... I have always upheld the Hippocratic oath,\" he stated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier will now spend a minimum of 22 years behind bars, having been at liberty throughout the trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has 10 days to lodge an appeal, which would entail a second trial within a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the trial prosecutor: \"His colleagues said he always seemed to have the answer. That he made himself out to be the best, that he created this character of the saviour, so that colleagues would instinctively turn to him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Péchier denied the charges and his lawyers argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But his own testimony varied in the trial, and he ended up admitting there must have been a poisoner at large in the clinic, but it was not him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The son of two parents in the medical profession, Péchier was described by a court psychologist as having a Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde personality – one side respectable, the other side capable of doing great harm. In 2014 and again in 2021 he made attempts to kill himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A divorced father of three children, he told the court before the verdict that his sole concern was to protect his family. His children wept as the sentence was read but he remained impassive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's the end of a nightmare,\" said survivor Sandra Simard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another patient who survived, Jean-Claude Gandon, said: \"We can have an easier Christmas now.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Australians have responded to that act of hatred with love and sympathy for those in mourning.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions have been high in the country since the shooting, with police detaining seven men in southwest Sydney on Thursday after receiving a tip that a \"violent act was possibly being planned\", New South Wales Police said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police said they did not identify \"any connection\" to their investigation into Sunday's attack in Bondi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two cars were \"intercepted\" at George Street, police said. In videos shared by local media sites, armed officers appeared to detain people on the street just hours after Albanese made his speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal, who also spoke at the press conference, said the country was \"at a very important moment not only for our community, but for fighting antisemitism around the world.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albanese said his government would be \"fully supporting and adopting\" the  recommendations Segal put forward in July in a report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her report was criticised by some upon its release in July due to its implications for free speech, including plans to monitor universities and arts organisations and withhold funding if they were deemed to have failed to act against antisemitism. There were concerns for instance, that the funding could be used to silence pro-Palestinian protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Jewish Council of Australia said it supported Albanese's commitment to act, including his focus on gun reform and online hate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, it said it was \"concerned that elements of today's announcement resemble long-standing proposals from the pro-Israel lobby which have nothing to do with addressing violent extremism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If education initiatives like university scorecards become a form of ideological policing - particularly where they are used to limit legitimate criticism of Israel - they will only make Jews less safe, and do the opposite of combating antisemitism,\" Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Dr Max Kaiser said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Albanese acknowledged accusations from the Jewish community that his government had not done enough to prevent antisemitism since the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas, and said more could have been done. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I accept my responsibility for the part in that as prime minister of Australia,\" he said. \"But what I also do is accept my responsibility to lead the nation and unite the nation. Because what people are looking for at this time isn't more division.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the government was \"shifting the threshold\" on hate speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There have been individuals who have managed to exploit a nation that had different principles of freedom of speech and have gone right to the limits of language that is clearly dehumanising, unacceptable, having no place in Australia, but have not quite crossed the threshold to violence,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Daniel Aghion, the President of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the peak body representing Australian Jews, said he would \"need to see the details before making an assessment as to whether the measures are likely to live up to their billing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We warned of the risk of not dealing with antisemitism in this country promptly and effectively after 7 October. It is an absolute tragedy that it has taken a massacre of Jewish and other Australians for that step to be taken.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

He said they would be paid for, in part, by his tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the combative address, Trump also touted his achievements on immigration while railing against opposition Democrats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking loudly and quickly, he seemed determined to convince Americans that the US was doing well - and things would only get better. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He claimed prices were falling, at a time when polls show that many Americans are unhappy about the cost of housing, childcare and healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats were critical of the speech. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the president's words \"showed he lives in a bubble completely disconnected from the reality everyday Americans are seeing and feeling\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Schumer added: \"People are feeling squeezed harder and harder every day and tonight Donald Trump took a victory lap.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the brief, 18-minute address, Trump said the \"warrior dividend\", which totals $2.57bn (£1.9bn), would be distributed \"in honour of our nation's founding in 1776\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump added that the funds were drawn from his sweeping tariffs, as well as <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0eqpz23l9jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the \"One Big, Beautiful Bill\" that he signed into law on 4 July</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody deserves it more than our military,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president offered little new information in the speech, and some of his assertions were either exaggerated or unfounded. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Much of Trump's address focused on his economic record and the administration's efforts to bring down prices - which he blamed on former US President Joe Biden and the Democrats. Trump mentioned the former president seven times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now, under our leadership, they [prices] are all coming down and coming down fast,\" he said. \"Democrat politicians also sent the cost of groceries soaring, but we are solving that too.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While fuel and egg prices have indeed fallen, many other food items are more expensive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Economic data from September shows the US inflation rate hit 3% for the first time since January, while consumer confidence fell to its lowest level since April due to concerns over the cost of living, jobs and the wider economy. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has previously acknowledged that concerns over rising prices have contributed to a lacklustre performance for candidates from his Republican Party during elections held in November - with the Democrats having success in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, as well as more recently in Miami and Georgia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has also acknowledged that incumbent presidents and their parties often fare poorly in mid-term elections, which will take place next year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has since been wrestling with how to address voter concerns about the economy, while at the same time pushing back on repeated Democratic criticism over rising prices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The political dilemma faced by the Trump administration has been highlighted by recent polling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One poll, from Politico, showed that about half of overall voters - and 4 in 10 people who voted for Trump in 2024 - felt the cost of living was the worst it has been in their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another poll, released in November by CBS News/YouGov, suggested that Trump's approval on economic issues had dropped 15 points since March - with 36% of Americans approving his handling of the issue. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More broadly, other polls show that Trump is at or near the lowest approval ratings of his second term, with concerns about the economy playing a significant role. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the president offered little in the way of empathy over prices, he did point to Republican efforts - such as tax reform legislation passed earlier this year - that he said would benefit many Americans in the coming year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he ran for re-election last year, Trump promised immediate results. And after 11 months in office, many Americans say they still haven't seen substantive change, and the president's speech might be unlikely to change their minds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump, in part, focused his remarks on the promise of improvements during 250th birthday celebrations for American's founding next year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When the world looks at us next year, let them see a nation that is loyal to its citizens, faithful to its workers, confident to its identity, certain to its destiny, and the envy of the entire globe,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are respected again, like we have never been respected before,\" he added.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Bongino did not say in his post why he was stepping down.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said the former podcast host \"did a great job\" in office, and \"wants to go back to his show\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino, who was appointed to the role by Trump in February, built a large following through his podcast and other media appearances. He was previously a New York City police officer and a US Secret Service agent assigned to protect Barack Obama, the former president.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino, a staunch Trump ally, was considered a surprise pick for the role –  which had previously been held by career agents – because he had no prior experience with the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The FBI Agents Association, which represents around 14,000 current and former agents, had opposed his appointment to the position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Announcing his decision to step down in Wednesday's social media post, Bongino wrote: \"I will be leaving my position with the FBI in January. I want to thank President Trump, AG [Pam] Bondi, and Director [Kash] Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you. God bless America, and all those who defend Her.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before joining the agency, Bongino had echoed disinformation and conspiracy theories about Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election, and about the 6 January 2021 pipe bomb investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino had previously called the pipe bomb case an \"inside job\". After taking office he pushed to make the investigation, which Attorney General Bondi said had \"languished\", a priority for the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, a man with no known ties to the government was arrested, nearly six years after the pipe bombs were discovered outside the national headquarters for the Republican and Democratic parties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">FBI Director Patel, in a social media post on Wednesday praising Bongino's tenure, said he had \"served as the people's voice for transparency, and delivered major breakthroughs in long unsolved cases like the pipe bomb investigation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it,\" Patel wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bongino also appeared to change his mind about the death of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein once he became a leader at the FBI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a commentator, he had questioned whether Epstein took his own life in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial. Then, in May, Bongino<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>said: \"I have seen the whole file. He killed himself\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo that said Epstein did take his own life, and did not have a \"client list\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The memo frustrated many of Trump's supporters, who echoed the Epstein conspiracy theories and rejected the justice department's findings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the BBC's media partner CBS News, the memo led to a contentious meeting between him and Bondi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bondi, who oversees the FBI, wrote in a brief post on X on Wednesday that \"Americans are safer\" because of Bongino's FBI service.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump wrote that Venezuela was \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America\". He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to the recent US actions, Venezuela - home to the world's largest proven oil reserves - has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed about 100 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another ship accused of drug trafficking was destroyed by the US military on Wednesday. US officials say four men were killed in the strike, which took place in the eastern Pacific Ocean.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

Another 11 people had so far died after the war-damaged buildings where they were sheltering collapsed, it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency, Mahmoud Bassal, put the death toll higher. He said in a video that a total of 17 people, including four children, had died because of building collapses and the cold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that 17 residential buildings had collapsed completely because of the wind and rain and that another 90 buildings had collapsed partially.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, video footage showed first responders from the Civil Defence recovering the body of a man from the rubble of a building in Shati refugee camp, north-west of Gaza City.

However, it stresses that no land has yet been seized under the new law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has repeatedly tried to mend fences with the Trump administration, most famously when Ramaphosa led a high-level delegation to the White House earlier this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, this backfired when <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz9yyd2epk2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Trump ambushed him with images, videos and news reports</a> allegedly showing that the government was persecuting white people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One video featured firebrand South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing: \"Shoot the Boer [Afrikaner], Shoot the farmer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, a South African court has ruled that this song, which Malema often chants at his political rallies, is not hate speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the US boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa and has said it would not invite South African officials to its meetings since it took over leadership of the grouping of the world's biggest economies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-mayeni-jones\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting-by-mayeni-jones\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting by Mayeni Jones</b></i></p></div></div></body></html>"

From 2003 to August 2025, the World Health Organization (WHO) has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.paho.org/en/documents/epidemiological-update-avian-influenza-ah5n1-americas-region-15-october-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">reported</a> 990 human H5N1 cases across 25 countries, including 475 deaths - a 48% fatality rate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the US alone, the virus has struck more than 180 million birds, spread to over 1,000 dairy herds in 18 states, and infected at least 70 people - mostly farmworkers - causing several hospitalisations and one death. In January, three tigers and a leopard died at a wildlife rescue centre in India's Nagpur city from the virus that typically infects birds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Symptoms in humans mimic a severe flu: high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and, at times, conjunctivitis. Some people have no symptoms at all. The risk to humans remains low, but authorities are watching H5N1 closely for any shift that could make it spread more easily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That concern is what prompted new peer-reviewed modelling by Indian researchers Philip Cherian and Gautam Menon of Ashoka University, which simulates how an H5N1 outbreak might unfold in humans and what early interventions could stop it before it spreads. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other words, the<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-025-25358-5\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> model </a>published in the BMC Public Health journal uses real world data and computer simulations to play out how an outbreak might spread in real life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The threat of an H5N1 pandemic in humans is a genuine one, but we can hope to forestall it through better surveillance and a more nimble public-health response,\" Prof Menon told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A bird flu pandemic, researchers say, would begin quietly: a single infected bird passing the virus to a human - most likely a farmer, market worker or someone handling poultry. From there, the danger lies not in that first infection but in what happens next: sustained human-to-human transmission.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because real outbreaks start with limited, messy data, the researchers turned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bharatsim.ashoka.edu.in/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">BharatSim</a>, an open-source simulation platform originally built for Covid 19 modelling, but versatile enough to study other diseases.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5a75/live/2a266e10-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images A worker at National Zoological Park sprays pesticides at the entrance gate to sanitize the premises as bird flu spread in the zoo area on 1 September, 2025 in New Delhi, India. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A bird flu outbreak in a Delhi zoo shut down the facility for a few days in August</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The key takeaway for policymakers is how narrow the window for action can be before an outbreak spirals out of control, the researchers say.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The paper estimates that once cases rise beyond roughly two to 10, the disease is likely to spread beyond primary and secondary contacts. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Primary contacts are people who have had direct, close contact with an infected person, such as household members, caregivers or close colleagues. Secondary contacts are those who have not met the infected person but have been in close contact with a primary contact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If households of primary contacts are quarantined when just two cases are detected, the outbreak can almost certainly be contained, the research found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time 10 cases are identified, it is overwhelmingly likely that the infection has already spread into the wider population, making its trajectory virtually indistinguishable from a scenario with no early intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To keep the study grounded in real-world conditions, the researchers chose a model of a single village in Namakkal district, Tamil Nadu - the heart of India's poultry belt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Namakkal is home to more than 1,600 poultry farms and some 70 million chickens; it produces over 60 million eggs a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A village of 9,667 residents was generated using a synthetic community - households, workplaces, market spaces - and seeded with infected birds to mimic real-life exposure. (A synthetic community is an artificial, computer-generated population that mimics the characteristics and behaviours of a real population.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the simulation, the virus starts at one workplace -  a mid-sized farm or wet market - spreads first to people there (primary contacts), and then moves outward to others (seconday contacts) they interact with through homes, schools and other workplaces.  Homes, schools and workplaces formed a fixed network.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By tracking primary and secondary infections, the researchers estimated key transmission metrics, including the basic reproductive number, R0 - which measures how many people, on average, one infected person passes the virus on to. In the absence of a real-world pandemic, the researchers instead modelled a range of plausible transmission speeds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then they tested what happens when different interventions - culling birds, quarantining close contacts and targeted vaccination - kicked in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The results were blunt. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Culling of birds works - but only if done before the virus infects a human. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If a spillover does occur, timing becomes everything, the researchers found.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Isolating infected people and quarantining households can stop the virus at the secondary stage. But once tertiary infections appear - friends of friends, or contacts of contacts - the outbreak slips out of control unless authorities impose much tougher measures, including lockdowns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Targeted vaccination helps by raising the threshold at which the virus can sustain itself, though it does little to change the immediate risk within households.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9690/live/d2e150b0-d92e-11f0-983a-fdbf166801c4.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Chicks at a poultry farm in Kachhawa village, near Karnal, Haryana, India.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">India's poultry industry is one of the world's largest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The simulations also highlighted an awkward trade-off. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quarantine, introduced too early, keeps families together for long stretches - and increases the chance that infected individuals will pass the virus to those they live with. Introduced too late, it does little to slow the outbreak at all.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The researchers say this approach comes with caveats. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The model relies on one synthetic village, with fixed household sizes, workplaces and daily movement patterns. It does not include simultaneous outbreaks seeded by migratory birds or by poultry networks. Nor does it account for behavioural shifts - mask-wearing, for instance - once people know birds are dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seema Lakdawala, a virologist at Atlanta-based Emory University, adds another caveat: this simulation model \"assumes a very efficient transmission of influenza viruses\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Transmission is complex and not every strain will have the same efficiency as another,\" she says, adding that scientists are also now starting to understand that not all people infected with seasonal flu spread the virus equally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says emerging research shows that only a \"subset of flu-positive individuals actually shed infectious influenza virus into the air\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This mirrors the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51447143\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">super-spreader phenomenon</a> seen with Covid-19, though it is far less well characterised for flu - a gap that could strongly influence how the virus spreads through human populations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What happens if H5N1 becomes successful in the human population?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Lakdawala believes that it \"will cause a large disruption likely more similar to the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/influenza-a-%28h1n1%29-outbreak?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2009 [swine flu] pandemic</a> rather than Covid-19\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is because we are more prepared for an influenza pandemic. We have known licensed antivirals that are effective against the H5N1 strains as an early defence and stockpiled candidate<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines/who-recommendations/zoonotic-influenza-viruses-and-candidate-vaccine-viruses\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> H5 vaccines</a> that could be deployed in the short term.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But complacency would be a mistake. Dr Lakdawala says if H5N1 becomes established in humans, it could re-assort - or intermingle - with existing strains, amplifying its public-health impact. Such mixing could reshape seasonal influenza, triggering \"chaotic and unpredictable seasonal epidemics\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indian modellers say the simulations can be run in real time and updated as data come in. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With refinements - better reporting delays, asymptomatic cases - they could give public-health officials something priceless in the early hours of an outbreak: a sense of which actions matter most, before the window for containment snaps shut.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"x\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">X</i></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - is highly dependent on revenues from its oil exports to finance its government spending.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US sanctions targeting Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA have made exporting oil difficult for the Venezuelan government, leading them to resort to a fleet of \"ghost ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what do we know about these vessels and how they operate?</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Total and complete blockade'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump imposed sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry as far back as 2019, during his first term as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That year, Venezuelan crude exports fell by more than half from roughly 1.1 million barrels per day in January to about 495,000 by the end of 2019, according to the US Energy Information Administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six years later, the sanctions remain in place but Venezuela's oil exports have grown again to around 920,000 barrels per day as of November, according to the news agency Reuters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While this falls far short of the country's peak level of oil exports of 3 million barrels per day in 1998, this partial recovery indicates that the sanctions against Venezuela are not working as the US hoped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It indicates that the government of Nicolás Maduro has found new ways to sell Venezuelan oil with the \"ghost fleet\" at their centre.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Not unique to Venezuela</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ghost fleets are a growing phenomenon, used not just by Venezuela but also by two other oil-producing countries under Western sanctions - Russia and Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial intelligence firm S&amp;P Global estimates that one in five oil tankers worldwide are used to smuggle oil from sanctioned countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of these, 10% carry only Venezuelan oil, 20% carry Iranian oil, while 50% are exclusively dedicated to Russian oil. The remaining 20% are not tied to any particular country and can transport oil from more than one of these nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oil sanctions aim to discourage countries or companies from buying or dealing with crude oil from sanctioned nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Companies and nations caught buying oil from sanctioned countries like Venezuela risk being sanctioned themselves by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctioned countries offer their oil at steep discounts so that companies or nations are willing to take the risk of buying it whilst applying tricks to disguise its origin.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">False flags and name changes</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the most common strategies ghost tankers use is to frequently change their name or flag - sometimes several times in a month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the tanker seized this Wednesday is called The Skipper, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ship has been sanctioned by the US Treasury since 2022 for its alleged role in an oil-smuggling network that helps finance Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, according to CBS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At that time, the tanker was named Adisa, but it was originally called Toyo. It was one of the vessels linked to Russian oil tycoon Viktor Artemov, who is also under sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Skipper is a 20-year-old vessel - another common trait among ghost fleet tankers. Major shipping companies usually dispose of ships after 15 years of service, and after 25 years they are typically scrapped.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Video shows US military seizing oil tanker off Venezuela coast</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Zombie ships'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another trick these ships use is to steal the identity of scrapped vessels by using their unique registration numbers assigned by the International Maritime Organization – similar to criminals using the identity of a dead person.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These are known as \"zombie ships\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last April, a ship called Varada arrived in Malaysian waters after a two-month journey from Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It raised suspicions because it was a 32-year-old boat and flew the flag of the Comoros, an island nation off east Africa, which is a popular choice among ships that want to avoid detection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a Bloomberg investigation, it was a zombie ship, as the real Varada had been scrapped in Bangladesh in 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The news agency compared satellite images with historical photos to detect four zombie ships carrying Venezuelan crude oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other common tactics include disguising the origin of crude oil by transferring it in international waters to legally compliant tankers with other flags.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These then deliver the oil to its destination, presenting it as coming from a country that is not sanctioned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This happened with Venezuelan oil exports to China during Trump's first term when sanctions were tightened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another common trick among these tankers is disabling the Automatic Identification System, which transmits data including the vessel's name, flag, position, speed or route.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This allows ships to hide their identity and location.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech says it believes The Skipper was \"spoofing its position for a long time\" - that is, transmitting a false signal, making it appear to be in a different location.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/808f/live/d9868250-d6ae-11f0-9566-091746611f5e.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Planet Labs PBC / Reuters Two large oil tankers are connected side by side at sea \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Planet Labs PBC / Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A satellite image taken on 18 November off Venezuelan waters shows The Skipper, on the right, alongside another vessel</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a report in October by the anti-corruption NGO Transparencia Venezuela, there were 71 foreign tankers at the ports of Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA - of which 15 are under sanctions and nine are linked to ghost fleets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It found that 24 tankers were operating under stealth, with their mandatory location signals deactivated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NGO says it detected six ship-to-ship cargo transfers in waters off western Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of the ships flew flags of countries considered regulatory havens with lax oversight of sanctions, including Panama, Comoros and Malta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many spent more than 20 days without docking at an oil terminal, unlike the Chevron-operated ships that the US has authorised in Venezuela, which load and leave within six days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The extended stay in port areas without directly reaching oil terminals raises serious doubts about the type of operations these vessels are conducting,\" said Transparencia Venezuela in its report.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given that the operation to seize the ship on 10 December came from the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier -
