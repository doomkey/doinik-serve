In 2024 that was €3.7bn. Legally using the interest is seen as safe as Russia is under sanction and the proceeds are not Russian sovereign property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But international military aid for Ukraine has slipped dramatically in 2025, and Europe has struggled to make up the shortfall left by the US decision to all but stop funding Ukraine under President Donald Trump.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are currently two EU proposals aimed at providing Ukraine with €90bn, to cover two-thirds of its funding needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One is to raise the money on capital markets, backed by the EU budget as a guarantee. This is Belgium's preferred option but it requires a unanimous vote by EU leaders and that would be difficult when Hungary and Slovakia object to funding Ukraine's military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That leaves loaning Ukraine cash from the Russian assets, which were originally held in securities but have now largely matured into cash. That money is Euroclear property held in the European Central Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU's executive, the European Commission, accepts Belgium has legitimate concerns and says it is confident it has dealt with them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The plan is for Belgium to be protected with a guarantee covering all the €210bn of Russian assets in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Should Euroclear suffer a loss of its own assets in Russia, a Commission source explained that would be offset from assets belonging to Russia's own clearing house which are in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Russia went after Belgium itself, any ruling by a Russian court would not be recognised in the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a key development, EU ambassadors have agreed that Russia's central bank assets held in Europe should be immobilised indefinitely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until now they have had to vote unanimously every six months to renew the freeze, which could have meant a repeated risk to Belgium.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU ambassadors used an emergency clause under Article 122 of the EU Treaties so the assets remain frozen as long as an \"immediate threat to the economic interests of the union\" continues, or until Russia pays war reparations to Ukraine in full.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson said the decision was an \"important step in enabling more support for Ukraine and protecting our democracy\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2cbb/live/c842c790-d75f-11f0-b252-db9838d38426.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Thierry Monasse/Getty Images German Chancellor Friedrich Merz (L) is welcomed by the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen (R)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Thierry Monasse/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The German chancellor (L) says the EU's plan will enable Ukraine to defend itself</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why Belgium is not yet satisfied</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Belgium is adamant it remains a staunch ally of Ukraine, but sees legal risks in the plan and fears being left to handle the repercussions if things go wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A usually divided political landscape in this case has rallied behind Prime Minister Bart De Wever, who is under pressure from European colleagues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Very important decisions\" would be made by the EU in the coming week, he said during a meeting with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in London on Friday. He added that Belgium and the UK would work together to \"get the certainty that we can support Ukraine to stay a free, democratic and sovereign country\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU believes it can secure sufficient guarantees for the loan itself, but Belgium fears an added risk of being exposed to extra damages or penalties.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Belgium is a small economy. Belgian GDP is about €565bn – imagine if it would need to shoulder a €185bn bill,\" says Veerle Colaert, professor of financial law at KU Leuven University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also believes the requirement for Euroclear to grant a loan to the EU would violate EU banking regulations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Banks need to comply with capital and liquidity requirements and shouldn't put all their eggs in one basket. Now the EU is telling Euroclear to do just that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why do we have these bank rules? It's because we want banks to be stable. And if things go wrong it would fall to Belgium to bail out Euroclear. That's another reason why it's so important for Belgium to secure water-tight guarantees for Euroclear.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Europe under pressure from every direction</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no time to lose, warn seven EU member states including those closest geographically to Russia such as the Baltics, Finland and Poland. They believe the frozen assets plan is \"the most financially feasible and politically realistic solution\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a matter of destiny for us,\" says leading German conservative MP Norbert Röttgen. \"If we fail, I don't know what we'll do afterwards. That's why we have to succeed in a week's time\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Russia is adamant its money should not be touched, there are added concerns among European figures that the US may want to use Russia's frozen billions differently, as part of its own peace plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky has said Ukraine is working with Europe and the US on a reconstruction fund, but he is also aware the US has been talking to Russia about future co-operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An early draft of the US peace plan referred to $100bn of Russia's frozen assets being used by the US for reconstruction, with the US taking 50% of the profits and Europe adding another $100bn. The remaining assets would then be used in some kind of US-Russia joint investment project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An EU source said the added advantage of Friday's expected vote to immobilise Russia's assets indefinitely made it harder for anyone to take the money away. Implicit is that the US would then have to win over a majority of EU member states to vote for a plan that would financially cost them an enormous sum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary's Viktor Orban, seen as Russia's closest partner in the EU, said Europe's leaders were \"placing themselves above the rules\" and replacing the rule of law with the rule of bureaucrats.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That deadline comes from a bill passed by Congress and signed by Trump last month following months of pressure from his Maga - Make America Great Again - base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite that legal requirement for the justice department, committee Democrats said on Friday: \"In the interest of transparency, we will continue to release photos from the Epstein estate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new photos on Friday marked the second time the committee has released images from its investigation into Epstein this month. These new images include intimate photos of Epstein, including one of him in a bathtub and another that appears to show sexual toys. They also show him with powerful people, including former President Bill Clinton and tech billionaire Bill Gates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Epstein's connection to so many high-profile figures, along with various unanswered questions about the case, and his 2019 suicide in a Manhattan jail as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges, has fuelled online conspiracies and accusations of a government cover-up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No additional context or details were included with the newly released images, so it is not clear when, why or where many of the photos were taken or by whom. Merely being pictured in files related Epstein is not an indication of wrongdoing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also in the newly released photos are images from Epstein's sunny estate on the US Virgin Islands, showing multiple rooms - including one with a dental chair surrounded by sculptures of moustached men on the walls.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig that has been carved in the likeness of Trump. Above it, a sign reads: \"Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the first batch of photos released earlier on Friday, Epstein is seen with multiple high-profile figures, none of whom have yet commented. Many of them have previously denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the congressional committee, said: \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"> \"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world. We will not rest until the American people get the truth. The Department of Justice must release all the files, NOW,\" he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Republicans, who are in the majority on the committee, have accused Democrats of \"cherry-picking photos and making targeted redactions to create a false narrative about President Trump\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House called the release a \"Democrat hoax\" against Trump that has been \"repeatedly debunked\". Trump had for months argued the Epstein saga was a distraction orchestrated by his critics to take attention away from his administration's accomplishments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump had been pressuring Republicans to move on but failed to keep his party from approving a measure forcing the justice department to release all files in the investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but has not been accused of any wrongdoing as part of the investigations into his former friend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Trump, the pair fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. The White House has also suggested that their fallout was connected to Epstein's behaviour, and that Trump booted him from his Florida resort for \"being a creep\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump appeared in three of the images released on Friday. One image showed him standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another showed Trump standing next to Epstein while talking to model Ingrid Seynhaeve at a 1997 Victoria's Secret party in New York – an image that was already publicly available. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div

The offices of several environmentalist groups were ransacked in the Charente-Maritime department.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">LSD is a highly contagious bovine disease which is transmitted mainly by fly-bites.  The symptoms are fever, mucal discharge and nodules on the skin.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though mainly non-fatal, it can badly affect milk-production and the cows are unsaleable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The disease arrived in Europe from Africa about ten years ago. France's first outbreak was in the Alps in June, when an infected herd forced the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cycling/articles/c5y9y2r5l77o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected has run up against bitter opposition from two of the three main farmers' unions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Conféderation Rurale and Conféderation Paysanne say the policy is being brutally applied, and is in any case unnecessary because a combination of selective culling and vaccination would suffice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most vets disagree. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Right now we are unable to tell the difference between a healthy animal and a symptomless animal carrying the virus. That is the only reason we have to carry out these whole-herd slaughters,\" said Stephanie Philizot who heads the SNGTV vets' union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since June there have been around 110 outbreaks of LSD in France, originally in the east but now increasingly in the south-west. Ministry officials blame the illegal movement of cattle from affected zones. Around 3,000 animals have been slaughtered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French government is worried the protests could snowball into a wider movement among a farming population that feels itself under growing threat from the imposition of EU norms and competition from abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A big protest is planned in Brussels next week during the summit of EU leaders.  Several French farming sectors are in deep crisis, from wine-growers hit by falling consumption to poultry farmers hit by avian flu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also widespread opposition to the impending signature of an EU free-trade agreement with South American countries, which farmers fear will open France to more cheap food imports, much of it produced under looser environmental and sanitary constraints.</p></div></div></body></html>"

An audience member even compares the atmosphere to \"Woodstock without the drugs\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans aren't just obsessed with the music. They hear themselves in her lyrics and see themselves in her public persona, as she navigates love, heartbreak, illness, treachery and finding your place in the world. She's a best friend, or an older sister, or a combination of the two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So when Swift takes a phone call in the documentary and says, \"Baby\", the whole theatre erupts -

laughing boisterously at on-screen jokes, marking the choreography through aggressive chair dancing, and cheering for each other as they rotated into scenes and through plot lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swift is both comfortable and content to let this diverse cast  \"pull focus\" and steal scenes, both on and off the stage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During one particularly moving segment, dancer Kameron Saunders - one of the tour's breakout stars - talks about his struggle to get hired because of his size and look.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, when his mum attends the tour, he tells her how much her love and support meant as he waited for his opportunity. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As those scenes played in New York, Swift affectionately turned to Saunders and yelled, \"YES!\" as he giggled and covered his face in feigned shyness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's easy to feel how life-changing the tour was for everyone involved.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">5) We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8316/live/7355a600-d686-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Taylor Swift with her crew at the premiere of the Eras tour movie in 2023\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Emotions ran high throughout the world tour</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As any Swiftie who has endlessly shout-sung the bridge to their favourite break-up song can tell you, there is no shortage of weeping in the Taylor-verse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Truly, there is So. Much. Crying. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The docuseries is no exception.

The simplest answer is that they're a rite of passage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putting the show together, Swift says she was \"thinking of all the girls I was before this one,\" while re-recording her albums and \"surgically tweaking\" songs to make them fit the show.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would seem the tears are a manifestation of feeling fully seen through her lyrics - of not feeling like you're being \"too much,\" or \"too dramatic,\" or \"too sensitive,\" as Swift broadly puts it - and having the freedom to express femininity without shame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As you watch, it becomes clear that these record-breaking shows were intended as a place safe to explore a wide spectrum of emotions and, in that, they truly succeeded.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

(2) As in the real world, perception requires action. (3) Players extend their perceptual field into the game, encompassing the available actions of the avatar. (4) The feedback loop of perception and action that enables you to navigate the world around you is now one step removed: instead of perceiving primarily through interaction of your own body with the external world, you're perceiving the game world through interaction of the avatar.

He believed that human societies were moving towards more rational forms regulated by effective and binding legal frameworks because only such frameworks enabled people to live in harmony, to prosper and to co-operate. However, his belief in inevitable progress was not based on an optimistic or high-minded view of human nature. On the contrary, it comes close to Hobbes's outlook: man's violent and conflict-prone nature makes it necessary to establish and maintain an effective legal framework in order to secure peace. We cannot count on people's benevolence or goodwill, but even 'a nation of devils' can live in harmony in a legal system that binds every citizen equally. Ideally, the law is the embodiment of those political principles that all rational beings would freely choose.

UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the atrocities taking place in Sudan were \"a scar on the conscience of the world\" which \"cannot, and will not, go unpunished.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dagalo, who was also placed under EU sanctions in November, was shown in verified footage touring an army base in the city in the hours after el-Fasher fell.

It is the second such legal challenge, with two Australian teens also awaiting a High Court hearing.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Despite the best intentions, this law is missing the mark,\" Reddit said in an update on its website.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are more effective ways for the Australian government to accomplish our shared goal of protecting youth.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australia's Communications Minister Anika Wells has previously said the government will not be swayed by legal threats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We will not be intimidated by big tech.

But, along with a higher age limit of 16, Australia is the first jurisdiction to deny an exemption for parental approval in a policy like this - making its laws the world's strictest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reddit said the law forces \"intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors\", isolates teens engaging in \"age-appropriate community experiences\" and creates an \"illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case is not \"an attempt to avoid compliance\" or \"an effort to retain young users for business reasons\", it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Unlike other platforms included under this law, the vast majority of Redditors are adults, we don't market or target advertising to children under 18,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The other platforms affected by the ban include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and  TikTok.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It's a circuitous route from home in Perth to the Fiona Stanley Hospital - but it's worth it, he says, to sit down for a game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons with people he may not know but with whom he shares a great deal in common.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sadmir and his board game companions are just some of the 300 patients at the gaming disorder clinic, Australia's only publicly-run institution of its type, helping patients wean themselves off excessive online gaming habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The room where they meet is a simple space in a faceless hospital but in the corner, there's a pile of boardgames on a chair. Jenga, Uno and Sushi Go are also popular choices at the informal group which is attended by both patients and clinicians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a bit of a departure for the 15-year-old who until a couple of months ago preferred to play games with friends online for 10 hours a day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It feels completely different,\" says Sadmir. \"You get to roll the dice instead of clicking a button. You can interact with people, so you actually know who's there rather than just being on a call with random people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Daniela Vecchio, the psychiatrist who set up the clinic, says that while gaming isn't bad in itself, it can become a problem - an addiction even.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaming platforms and social media pose similar risks for children: excessive time spent online, and potential exposure to predators, harmful content or bullying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So she wonders why gaming platforms have not been included in Australia's \"world-first\" social media ban for under-16s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ban, which came into force on Wednesday, is supposed to prevent teens from having accounts on 10 social media platforms including Instagram, Snapchat and X. Children will still be able to access platforms like YouTube and TikTok, but without accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Vecchio, the omission of gaming platforms is odd.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It doesn't make much sense,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Gaming and social media are so interconnected, it's very difficult to separate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The individual who plays games for excessive amounts of time also spends excessive amounts of time on social media platforms where they can see other gamers or can live stream gaming, so it's a way to connect.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Daniela Vecchio runs Australia's only publicly funded clinic for gaming disorder clinic</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sadmir, for example, spent much of his time on the gaming platform Steam, as well as YouTube. Dr Vecchio singles out the platforms Discord and Roblox as particular worries - a concern echoed by many experts and parents the BBC has spoken to in covering the ban and its impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Roblox and Discord have been dogged by claims that some children are being exposed to explicit or harmful content through them and are facing lawsuits relating to child safety in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Roblox <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lp5pn9e1qo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">introduced new age assurance features</a> in Australia and two other countries weeks before the social media ban kicked in, with the checks due to be rolled out to the rest of the world in January. The checks will \"help us provide positive, age-appropriate experiences for all users on Roblox\", the company said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Discord <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">also introduced age checks</a> on some features earlier this year and on Wednesday said it was introducing a new \"teen-by-default\" setting for all Australian users. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The 'wild west of internet usage'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former gaming clinic patient Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether a social media ban could have influenced the access he got at a younger age.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was growing up in the wild west of internet usage so, there weren't any restrictions,\" he says. \"I got free rein on the internet basically. So I think that for me, the damage has already been done.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former quantum finance intern interested in AI, Mr Koo lost his job just before the pandemic. Living in Sydney, he had no family nearby and no regular work. He says he lost confidence and ended up consumed by online gaming, likening his experience to substance abuse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Vecchio agrees with the comparison - if she had her way, she'd be tempted not just to expand the social media ban to gaming but to raise the age to 18.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gaming disorder is also now recognised by the World Health Organisation as an official diagnosis and, according to a 2022 Macquarie University study, around 2.8% of Australian children are affected by it. Vecchio thinks the number at risk is higher.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kevin Koo, 35, wonders whether he might have benefited from a social media ban</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australian government says its ban is about protecting kids from harmful content, cyberbullying, online grooming and \"predatory algorithms\" among other things – some or all of which could arguably be said to exist with gaming platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Australia Federal Police are among those who have warned chatrooms on these sites are hotbeds for radicalisation and child exploitation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, as the eSafety Commissioner said last month, the legislation enforcing the ban means platforms were not selected according to \"safety, a harms or risk-based assessment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, platforms have been selected according to three criteria: whether the platform's sole or \"significant purpose\" is to enable online social interaction between two or more users; whether it allows users to interact with some or all other users; and whether it allows users to post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exceptions were made for gaming, for example, because its primary purpose is not social-media style interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law, say some experts, makes no sense.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's incompetence, it's reactionary,\" says Marcus Carter, professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Social interaction is not a bad thing… There are a bunch of probably legitimate concerns about these big tech platforms and what they are affording children and what they are exposing them to so as a result we've said we are banning social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just wish the government was trying to figure out how to help rather than put a band-aid on a bullet wound,\" he says.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Australia's social media ban explained... in 60 seconds</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University and chief investigator at the ARC Centre of Excellence for the Digital Child, also says the ban on social media is too blunt a tool – instead a more nuanced approach is needed, including towards gaming platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is such a wide spectrum of gaming from incredibly positive, nurturing, fun, creative, expressive spaces - something like Minecraft comes to mind where it's had so many positive uses.\" However, platforms like Roblox are at the other end of the spectrum, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Roblox isn't a game. It's a series of enabling tools for other people to make games. And we know that some of the games that have been made that clearly feel like they're meant for adults have been accessed by very young people.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Professor Leaver's desk at the university are three plushies with inbuilt ChatGPT inside them.

The patron was well covered, wearing a black hoodie, a medical mask and a tan beanie. But one key detail stuck out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only thing you can see is his eyebrows,\" the employee told police.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was not the only time Mr Mangione's distinguished eyebrows have come up. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors also entered into evidence notecards they say Mr Mangione had, which appeared to be to-do lists for the days after the high-profile shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One card reads: \"Keep momentum, FBI slower overnight,\" while another said: \"Change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a92b/live/29054330-d758-11f0-845f-035d2c9c25f7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office A note from police search of Mr Mangione\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Prosecutors said Mr Mangione was carrying a note that appeared to be a to-do list, with instructions to \"change hat, shoes, pluck eyebrows\"</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Proposterous': An unexpected day at McDonald's</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dozens of videos released by prosecutors show Mr Mangione's encounter with police and his eventual arrest in the McDonald's as other customers watched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officers who responded narrated the footage this week, telling the court what was going through their minds as they realised the 27-year-old appeared similar to the suspect in photos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Altoona Lieutenant William Hanelly said a fellow officer responded sarcastically that he would \"get right on it\" when he heard the tip about the suspect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hanelly told the court that he understood the sarcasm, because it seemed \"preposterous\" that a shooter from \"New York City had found his way to a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But at the scene, officers said they quickly saw the resemblance to New York Police Department pictures circulated to the public after days without any leads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's him. I'm not kidding. He's real nervous. It's him,\" one officer can be heard telling Mr Hanelly in a phone call played for the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one video, Mr Mangione eats a McDonald's meal as officers stand guard around him in the restaurant waiting for more officers to arrive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the hearing, Mr Mangione watched the videos quietly from the defence table, seated next to his lawyers - wife and husband Karen Friedman Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo. The latter defended Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges just months earlier.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wearing a grey suit and button-down shirt most days, Mr Mangione frequently took notes on a legal pad, and occasionally smiled and laughed with his lawyers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A fake name leads to an arrest</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: \"What's your name?\" - Moment police confront Luigi Mangione at McDonald's</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the series of police body camera videos played for the court, Mr Mangione's interactions with officers eventually lead to his arrest on 9 December as Christmas music plays loudly in the background of the McDonald's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When officers first speak to Mr Mangione, they ask him to pull his mask down. He listens, and is heard telling officers his name is \"Mark Rosario\", handing them a New Jersey identification that police later said was false.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That identification gave officers enough cause to arrest Mr Mangione, Mr Hanelly told the court, and in the video, Mr Mangione tells officers his real name is Luigi.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another body camera video, an officer tells the 27-year-old he is under police investigation for giving a fake identification and Mr Mangione is seen putting his hands on the wall as officers arrest him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They then take a photo of Mr Mangione with his hands behind his back, an image  widely circulated on social media after his arrest.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Bullets, a journal and cash: a peak into Mr Mangione's backpack</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The pre-trial hearing also shed light on the items Mr Mangione was carrying when he was arrested.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's lawyers have argued that a 9mm handgun as well as a notebook should be excluded from trial because officers did not have a warrant to search his backpack. Prosecutors allege that Mr Mangione wrote in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed-fuelled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the hearing on Thursday, Mr Hanelly argued that there were exceptions for warrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier in the week, Ms Friedman Agnifilo questioned the officer who searched Mr Mangione's backpack, arguing they were searching the bag \"because you thought he was the New York City shooter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No, we search everyone,\" said the officer, Christy Wasser.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6976/live/85d97cd0-d6d0-11f0-a192-19d7b6119976.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"New York County District Attorney's Office Dozens of $100 bills found during Mr Mangione's arrest\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">New York County District Attorney's Office</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Evidence found during Mr Mangione's arrest</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Video played in court shows a police officer pulling a series of items from the backpack, including a handgun magazine that Mr Hanelly said contained 9 mm bullets - all as Holly Jolly Christmas plays over the speaker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One law enforcement official comes across a journal in the backpack, and can be heard saying it reads like a \"manifesto\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Agnifilo objected after the \"manifesto\" part of the video was played repeatedly  in court, arguing the prosecutor wanted to emphasise the line.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually, Mr Hanelly testified, the officers decided to stop searching the backpack and take it to the police station because \"it was going to be a mess\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors this week entered into evidence images of other items Mr Mangione had with him, including a gun, a silencer, dozens of $100 bills, face masks, a hair trimmer and a passport.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hearing is expected to continue into next week.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But many experts - and Maduro himself - believe Washington's real goal is regime change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So at the Venezuelan president's hour of greatest need, what has changed?</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile, argues that Venezuela has become a far lower priority for both Beijing and Moscow, especially since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no reason today for either Russia or China to go all-in defending Venezuela given their other problems, such as Russia and its war in Ukraine, and China trying to coexist internationally with President Trump,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has poured enormous resources into the conflict, straining both its finances and its military. It has also faced sweeping Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This leaves fewer resources for allies that previously benefited from Kremlin support, says Prof Vladimir Rouvinski, the director of the Laboratory of Politics and International Relations (PoInt) at Icesi University in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria and Iran, Moscow's long-standing allies in the Middle East, have faced a similar fate in recent times.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia will [not] risk receiving more sanctions than it already has, [and] China will not risk getting more tariffs imposed on it for defending Maduro,\" Prof Rouvinski explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro reportedly asked China and Russia for military assistance at the end of October, according to The Washington Post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kremlin's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has said \"we support Venezuela, as it supports us\", while urging the Trump administration to avoid escalating the crisis, Russian media reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And in the wake of the American seizure of the oil tanker, the Kremlin said Putin had called Maduro to affirm his support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But so far, Moscow has not provided any material assistance.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251203-121739-f954f14c69-web-2.35.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7994/live/b2710eb0-d5eb-11f0-ab62-eb598af64ced.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Russian President Vladimir Putin in a dark suit with a burgundy tie patterned with white dots shakes hands with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who wears a dark suit and an orange tie with white dots\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Putin and Maduro met in Moscow in May 2025.

It's pitch black. We're using flashlights to communicate. This is very scary, lots of things can go wrong.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite the risks, they didn't. Machado arrived safely in Oslo, Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize just before midnight on Wednesday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Machado had been living in hiding in her own country since Venezuela's widely disputed elections last year, and hadn't been seen in public since January. Her grown-up children, who she hadn't seen in two years, were in Oslo to greet her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Grey Bull specialises in rescue missions and evacuations, especially from conflict and disaster zones. A representative from Machado's team confirmed to CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the organisation was behind her rescue operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Stern said that Grey Bull had been building up a presence in the Caribbean, including inside Venezuela and the neighbouring island of Aruba, for months to get ready for potential operations in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've been building infrastructure on the ground in Venezuela designed to get Americans, allies and Brits and other people out should the war in Venezuela start,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speculation has been mounting over possible US military action against Venezuela, after US President Donald Trump called on President Maduro to leave office, accusing him of sending narcotics and murderers to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Stern said the challenge in this case was getting somebody out who is as well-known as María Corina Machado - a household name in Venezuela for the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of the infrastructure his firm had built up in the country, he said, was \"designed for the second most popular person in the damn country with a target on her back.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: María Corina Machado on her 'very dangerous' escape from Venezuela</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he was first put in contact with Machado's team, they did not initially disclose her identity, but Mr Stern said he was able to guess. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they got in touch with him in early December, through a contact who knew Machado's team, it was apparently the second attempt to get her out of Venezuela, after an initial plan \"didn't go well,\" Mr Stern said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The operation was dubbed \"Golden Dynamite\" because \"Nobel invented dynamite\" and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept the Nobel Peace Prize award.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Matters moved quickly. Mr Stern said he spoke with the team on a Friday, they deployed on the Sunday, and by Tuesday, their mission was complete.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His team had explored various possibilities to get Machado out of the country, and settled on a plan that involved a tumultuous sea journey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To protect his future work in Venezuela, Mr Stern can only reveal so much about the trip.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By land, they moved Machado from a house where she was in hiding, to a pick-up spot for a small boat, which took her off the coast to a slightly bigger boat where she met up with him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The voyage was in \"very rough seas\" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in \"pitch-black darkness,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The journey was not fun. It was cold, it was very wet, we were all soaked, the waves were very rough, and we used that to our advantage.
