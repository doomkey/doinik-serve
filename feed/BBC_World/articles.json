We are resolute in seeking an end to this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is yet to publicly comment on why the Israeli negotiators were leaving Doha.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the senior Israeli official - speaking on the condition of anonymity - insisted there was \"no collapse\" in the talks, the Times of Israel reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The official criticised Hamas's \"rejectionist and unfortunate approach\", adding that \"we reached the stage where we actually need to return, and we will return here as soon as the right way is found to reduce the gaps and reach the closing stage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement early on Friday, Hamas said: \"The movement affirms its keenness to continue negotiations and engage in them in a manner that helps overcome obstacles and leads to a permanent ceasefire agreement.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest round of talks in Doha - with Qatari and Egyptian mediators - has been going on for more than two weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Earlier on Thursday, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) said that one in five children in Gaza City was now malnourished and cases were increasing every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation - pressing for governments to take action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, has repeatedly said that there is no siege, blaming Hamas for any cases of malnutrition. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel stopped aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip in early March following a two-month ceasefire. The blockade was partially eased after nearly two months, but food, fuel and medicine shortages worsened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the UN human rights office, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food aid over the past two months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It says at least 766 of them have been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another 288 people have been reported killed near UN and other aid convoys.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At least 59,106 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.</p></div></div></body></html>"

This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At a sports complex that was converted into an evacuation centre in Thailand's Surin province, evacuees - many of them children and elderly - said they were still shaken by the rocket and artillery attacks they witnessed on Thursday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Older evacuees who had lived through bombardments during the Cambodian Civil War of the 1980s told the BBC the recent fighting was the worst they had experienced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Joi Phasuwan, from the Phanom Dong Rak district, said she and her two grandchildren \"waited a long time\" before they finally got moved to the evacuation centre.

But the ruling means she has been granted a reprieve from  possible ousting, at least until February 2026.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This also gives her more time to gather support for a possible presidential run in the crucial run-up years to the 2028 general elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Had the impeachment vote gone against her, Duterte would not have been able to run for president.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The ruling is the latest development in the dramatic Duterte-Marcos saga, which has seen them go from allies to foes. Both children of powerful former leaders, the two had joined hands in 2022 to form a political super alliance known as the \"Uniteam\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But after the duo swept to victory, the cracks soon began to appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A war of words that saw even Sara's father Rodrigo Duterte call Marcos a \"drug addict\" reached a climax last November, when she made a Facebook post claiming that if she were to be killed she had \"spoken to a person\" to ensure the President was killed too. This comment <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzn4j0g20o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">triggered the impeachment proceedings</a> against her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Things then became even more personal when Sara's father <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c6253ly20p4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">was suddenly extradited to the Hague</a> to face charges of crimes against humanity for his notorious war on drugs, which is believed to have killed thousands of people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But even before this ruling, the odds of convicting Sara in the Senate impeachment court, or even starting the proceedings, was uncertain due to shifting political alliances that followed the general election in May. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The feud between Duterte and Marcos had dominated the election, and Duterte won more seats in the Senate than expected, in what was seen as a rebuff of the incumbent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 15-member Supreme Court is dominated by appointees of Sara's father.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Impeachment proceedings are extremely divisive in Philippine's chaotic political landscape. Since the restoration of democracy to the country in 1986, only one such attempt has successfully ended with a verdict - that of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona, who was convicted of hiding his assets in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Former president Joseph Estrada's impeachment for alleged graft was cut short in 2001, after public anger over the conduct of the trial sparked massive street protests that eventually led to his ouster.</p></div></div></body></html>"

In addition a car bomb blamed on LARF killed two French bomb-disposal experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Abdallah was arrested in Lyon in 1984.

Initially he was charged only with having false passports and criminal association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A short time later a French citizen was kidnapped in northern Lebanon, and the French secret service entered a negotiation via Algeria to engineer an exchange.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The French citizen was freed, but just before Abdallah was to be released police in Paris found a cache of weapons at his flat, including the gun used to kill the diplomats. This made his release impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two years later in the run up to his trial, Paris was hit by a spate of terrorist attacks which killed 13 people. These were blamed by politicians and the media on allies of Abdallah trying to pressurise France into freeing him. Later it was established that in fact they were the work of the Lebanese Shia group Hezbollah, under instructions from Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the trial, Abdallah denied involvement in the murders but defended their legitimacy.

WWF.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He first competed in the WWF in 1979, but became a mainstay and fan favourite in the mid-1980s alongside Andre the Giant and 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper.</p><p

\"Hulkamania\" transferred to the small and big screens, with roles in films such as Rocky III, No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny, Santa With Muscles, and a 1996 episode of Baywatch.</p><p

and Muppets From Space, and lent his voice to episodes of Robot Chicken and American Dad!</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 1985, Hogan became the star of his own cartoon series on CBS, Hulk

So it was a good day.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a short post on X, Blanche wrote: \"Today, I met with Ghislaine Maxwell, and I will continue my interview of her tomorrow. The Department of Justice will share additional information about what we learned at the appropriate time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Blanche said earlier this week that he planned to speak to Maxwell about any information she had on other people who might have been helped by Epstein to sexually abuse girls. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat and fierce Trump critic, took issue with the fact that Trump sent Blanche, his former personal lawyer turned federal prosecutor, to interview Maxwell ahead of her potential public testimony. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The conflict of interest is glaring. It stinks of high corruption,\" he said on X.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a post on Truth Social late on Thursday, Trump said the renewed focus on Epstein was a \"SCAM\" and a \"Democrat CON JOB\", and accused Schumer's party of trying to \"distract and obfuscate\" from the achievements of the first six months of his second term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Calls have recently intensified from the US public - including Trump's loyal supporters - and lawmakers for the justice department to release files related to the Epstein matter. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi informed Trump during a May briefing that his name appeared in justice department documents related to Epstein. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump and Epstein were friends before, according to the president, they fell out in the early 2000s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The White House pushed back, dismissing the WSJ story as \"fake news\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But an unnamed White House official told the Reuters news agency they were not denying that Trump's name appears in the documents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The official pointed to Epstein files disclosed months earlier by the justice department that had included Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Being named in the documents is not evidence of any criminal activity, nor has Trump ever been accused of wrongdoing in connection with the Epstein case.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Watch: How are Americans reacting to Trump's handling of the Epstein files?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While campaigning for the presidency last year, Trump had promised to release such files about the well-connected sex offender.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But his supporters have since grown frustrated with the administration's handling of the issue, including its failure to deliver a rumoured \"client list\" of Epstein. In a memo earlier this month, the justice department and FBI said there was no such list.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, following an earlier conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. His death was ruled a suicide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the years since, conspiracy theories about the nature of his crimes and his death itself have proliferated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, a sub-committee of the US House of Representatives voted to subpoena the justice department for the files, which must be signed off by the committee chairman. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Republicans on the House Oversight Committee have also subpoenaed Maxwell to testify before the panel remotely from prison on 11 August. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">House Speaker Mike Johnson has warned that Maxwell - who for years helped Epstein groom and sexually abuse girls - cannot be trusted to provide accurate testimony.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Maxwell's lawyer, Markus, previously told the BBC the concerns were \"unfounded\" and that if she chose to testify, rather than invoke her constitutional right to remain silent, \"she would testify truthfully, as she always has said she would\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, the justice department asked a federal judge to release years-old grand jury testimony related to a 2006 Florida investigation into Epstein, but a federal judge in the state on Wednesday declined to make the documents public.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

While the tariffs were initially paused until 9 July, the US later extended the deadline to 1 August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Indian delegations have made multiple trips to the US to finalise details of the deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last week, Trump seemed equally optimistic, saying that Washington and Delhi were <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ley8pe5qlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">\"very close\" to finalising</a> an interim trade agreement. The two countries aim to reach a bilateral deal by the end of this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Speaking to Reuters news agency on Thursday, Goyal <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-goyal-hopeful-concluding-us-trade-deal-after-fantastic-progress-2025-07-24/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">said</a> that India was making \"fantastic progress\" in trade deal talks with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I do hope we'll be able to conclude a very consequential partnership,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">When asked about India's main sticking point - lower tariffs on agriculture and dairy products - Goyal said that \"negotiations happen in the negotiation room.\" However, he added that India might still pursue a comprehensive deal if smaller sectoral agreements can be achieved, according to Reuters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The minister expressed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-24/india-s-commerce-minister-confident-they-ll-get-us-trade-deal?srnd=homepage-europe\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">similar confidence </a>to Bloomberg, saying he believed India and the US would reach a deal before the deadline. However, it remains unclear how they will resolve the key issues that has stalled negotiations for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Washington has pushed for greater access to India's farm sector for years, seeing it as a major untapped market. But India has fiercely protected it, citing food security, livelihoods and interests of millions of small farmers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn. Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double this figure to $500bn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has already reduced tariffs on a range of goods - including Bourbon whiskey and motorcycles - but the US continues to run a $45bn (£33bn) trade deficit with India, which Trump is keen to reduce.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Other players then entered the room and engaged in further sexual acts with her. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lawyers for the players contended that she asked the men to have sex with her and they believed she gave consent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">EM, however, testified that she was intoxicated and felt fearful of the men. While she had initially agreed to have sex with Mr McLeod, she testified that she did not agree to what unfolded afterwards.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Only one player, Mr Hart, testified in his own defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trial attracted significant attention in Canada. Many people had attended court to hear the ruling on Thursday, forcing clerks to open two additional overflow rooms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the players appeared visibly relieved in Thursday's hearing after Justice Carroccia revealed that she was not convinced with EM's testimony. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9544/live/9474c2b0-68d8-11f0-8dbd-f3d32ebd3327.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters In a court sketch, former 2018 Team Canada World Junior players Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote and Michael McLeod are seen from behind as they sit in court, after a judge found Hart and his teammates not guilty.

The first was taken without her knowledge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While under Canadian law the videos did not establish consent, the judge said they did show EM \"speaking normally, smiling\", and that she \"did not appear to be in distress\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That undercut the Crown's argument that EM did not leave the room out of fear, she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is unclear if the Crown will appeal. Prosecutor Meaghan Cunningham said her team will carefully review the decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She added they had received \"dozens of messages from people across Canada and abroad\" expressing support for EM.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A successful prosecution is not measured solely by whether there are guilty verdicts at the end,\" she said. \"The Crown's goal throughout this proceeding has been to see a fair trial, a trial that is fair to the men charged, and one that is also fair to EM.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout the trial, the Crown argued the woman's testimony was credible, that \"intoxication does not equal unreliability\" and that any inconsistencies in her testimony were minor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They also argued the woman did not have a motive to fabricate a story and that she had initially reported the alleged assault to police in 2018, four years before filing the lawsuit against Hockey Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They added that text messages between the players allegedly showed it was Mr McLeod's idea to invite his teammates to the room and that the players allegedly engaged in \"getting their story straight\" by drafting a narrative that EM had consented to all sexual activity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Justice Carroccia dismissed that argument, saying the players were \"recounting their recollections\" of what unfolded. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Reuters Protesters in front of courthouse hold signs showing support for EM that read \"We believe her\", \"Justice for EM\" and \"My dress is not a yes\"' class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Defence lawyers argued that EM's testimony was undermined by eyewitness testimony from two players who were present in the room but not charged in connection with the incident.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both had told the court that the woman was \"vocal\" about what she wanted sexually. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lawyers for the players also argued that the woman was a willing participant who later felt regret, and that intoxication in this case did not equal \"incapacity\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several protestors in support of EM had gathered outside the courthouse throughout the trial and on verdict day. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One of them, Fabienne Haller, told the BBC she felt \"devastated\" with the outcome.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She added that she believed the case \"will influence the next decade, and even more, of how sexual assault cases are going to be dealt with\" in Canada. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The day before, Ukraine's security services had carried out searches and arrests targeting alleged Russian spies at the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The passing of the legislation instantly sparked the largest protests since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 in several cities across Ukraine, with many worrying the law would severely undermine the Nabu and Sap's authority and effectiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w19vxjr44o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Thousands of people gathered in streets and squares across Ukraine</a>, holding placards calling for the legislation to be vetoed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several commentators accused Zelensky of democratic backsliding.

There have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, too – in 2008 and 2011, clashes on a similar scale saw 40 people killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, these were de-escalated relatively quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even as recently as this May, after an incident in which a Cambodian soldier was killed, both sides looked keen to prevent more violence, with meetings between army commanders from each country aimed at easing the tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But on Thursday, it erupted.

She appeared to believe that she could resolve their differences by appealing to his friendship with her father, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past that friendship was used by Thaksin's opponents to charge him with putting Cambodia's interests above those of Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2014, when a government headed by Thaksin's sister Yingluck was deposed by a military coup, Hun Sen allowed scores of his supporters to seek sanctuary in Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries have also cooperated in more shadowy areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last November, Thailand sent six Cambodian dissidents, together with a young child, back to Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed. All were recognised by the United Nations as refugees.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2020, a young Thai activist who had fled to Cambodia, Wanchalerm Satsaksit, was abducted and disappeared, it is presumed by Thai operatives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And the January gunning down of a Cambodian opposition leader in broad daylight in central Bangkok was also seen by activists as an outcome of this understanding between the two countries' security services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Against this background, the leaking of Paetongtarn's conversation appears to have caught the Shinawatra family completely off-guard. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The responses from both Thaksin and Paetongtarn reveal a sense of betrayal.

In both countries, there is a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to compromise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In Prime Minister Hun Manet, Cambodia has the inexperienced son of a former strongman who does not yet have his own authority, while in his father Hun Sen it also has a man who appears willing to push this conflict further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On the Thai side, the shaky coalition government centred on Thaksin's party is dealing with a stagnant economy and reeling from the threat of punitive US tariffs. It cannot afford to show weakness in standing up to Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodia too is dealing with a struggling economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It never fully recovered from the pandemic and tourism - a pillar of its economy - has suffered from the absence of Chinese visitors staying away for fear of being kidnapped and forced to work in scam centres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And - as with Thailand - now there is the threat of punishing US tariffs impacting the economy further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But both countries do have experienced politicians in Hun Sen and Thaksin who almost certainly can, when they are both ready, find a way out of this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We will also have to see whether other members of Asean weigh in on this conflict and try to persuade both countries to de-escalate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That was originally Asean's primary purpose - to avoid conflict among its members - and it will be a priority for some of the Asean states at the moment to help these two countries resolve the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What remains a mystery at this point though is why Hun Sen decided to burn this friendship and inflame this conflict. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Perhaps it was Thailand's decision to put pressure on scam centres this year, or Thaksin's ambition to legalize gambling, threatening Cambodia's own lucrative casino industry. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Or perhaps it was something simpler: a Machiavellian move by one of Asia's wiliest political survivors, to abandon an ally in Thaksin who has lost much of his influence in Thailand, while at the same time burnishing his nationalist credentials in the eyes of his own people.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

There is, however, a man-made shortage engineered by Hamas,\" government spokesman David Mencer told a briefing on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Now, too often the full story is not being told. This suffering exists because Hamas has created it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mencer said more than 4,400 lorry loads of aid had entered Gaza over the past two months, but that about 700 lorry loads were waiting for collection at two crossing points for collection by the UN and its humanitarian partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This is a bottleneck which has been caused by the United Nations, and it's the main obstacle to maintaining a consistent flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, UN agencies have said that it is nearly impossible to co-ordinate safe passage for their convoys with Israeli troops, leaving Palestinians at the mercy of a rapidly expanding starvation that is reaching every family in Gaza.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Two months ago, he signed up with a campaign group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He has never done these things before. \"Previous social movements were important, but to be honest they didn't make me this angry,\" the 39-year-old photographer told the BBC. \"We are citizens... and we need to make sure our society sticks to its democratic systems and spirit.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now, that anger is reaching a turning point. On Saturday Taiwan will hold a vote to decide whether to kick out more than two dozen lawmakers accused of being too close to China, in what has been called \"dabamian\", or the Great Recall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The unprecedented vote may alter the balance of political power in Taiwan. But already it has deepened political divisions, with both sides of the debate claiming to be the saviour of Taiwan's sacred democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It began with last January's elections, when voters chose the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) William Lai as their president, but gave the opposition the dominant presence in the parliamentary Legislative Yuan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the following months, the main opposition party Kuomintang worked together with the smaller Taiwan People's Party and independents to block DPP bills and pass controversial pieces of legislation. This included limiting the constitutional court's powers, cutting the government's budget, and raising the threshold for holding recall votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These moves provoked significant outrage among some Taiwanese, who saw them as stymying the DPP government while strengthening the opposition's parliamentary power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2024, thousands began holding protests in what became known as the Bluebird movement, named partially after the Taipei street where many had gathered.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9975/live/d67897f0-6882-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images A wide shot of thousands of protesters sitting on a boulevard in Taipei at night, holding up protest signs.

All these seats are held by the Kuomintang - and if enough are successfully recalled, it could mean the DPP eventually gains the majority in the legislature.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Taiwan has held recall votes before, it has never seen so many within such a short space of time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Saturday, citizens in 24 districts will vote on a simple yes or no question: whether they agree to boot out their legislator. Another round of voting will be held in August for the remaining recall cases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In each district, if the number of votes exceeds 25% of registered voters and more than half approve the recall, the seat will be vacated and a by-election must be held within three months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This means that voter turnout is crucial for the Great Recall's success - and it is the reason why civic groups have been relentlessly flooding social media and pounding the streets canvassing for votes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On a recent weekday night, Deng Pu and several members of his civic group stood outside a Taipei subway station. Some held up banners and chanted slogans, while others distributed paper fans and tissue packets emblazoned with the words  \"Let's go out together to vote\" and \"Say yes to the recall\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Deng acknowledged that with several of the recall votes taking place in Kuomintang strongholds, even if they did succeed, the party could be re-elected in  by-elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Even so, the Great Recall would still be worth it, he insisted, as it was a way to \"correct our democracy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Whatever the result may be, it would \"send a strong signal to all the political parties you must respect the latest wishes of Taiwan's citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Deng acknowledged that many in the Bluebird movement were DPP supporters, but denied that the civic groups were funded by the party – a theory heavily pushed by the opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We don't care whether DPP wins the by-elections. What's more urgent to us is that we hope to have a normal parliament, one that is not close to China and the Chinese Communist Party.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He also took issue with what he saw as a weak response from the DPP, saying: \"From the first recall petition till now, the civic groups have been telling the DPP that the citizens are here and there are many of us... We are strongly calling on the DPP to join us.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c760/live/63fc6090-6872-11f0-8f9f-1d38db11c370.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC / Tessa Wong A man with salt and pepper hair wearing wire-rimmed glasses and a face mask poses for the camera.

But eventually it showed its support, with Lai stressing that the DPP \"must align with the power of the people\" and ordering party officials to assist pro-recall groups to \"protect the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has inevitably fueled the opposition's accusation that the DPP has secretly engineered the Great Recall and Bluebird movement, pointing to the fact that the DPP could reap the most political gain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It not only stands a chance of winning a permanent majority in the legislature. Even if the Kuomintang eventually wins in the by-elections, the DPP would have held the majority for a few weeks, giving it enough time to push through crucial laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Anti-recall protests organised by the Kuomintang and other opposition parties have drawn thousands. At one such rally in the New Taipei district of Banqiao last weekend, supporters showed up waving banners and chanting \"No to the vote\" while crossing their arms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As they took to the stage, speaker after speaker condemned the Great Recall while characterising William Lai as a fascist and authoritarian traitor of Taiwan's democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Large screens played videos of Lai doctored to make him look like Adolf Hitler with the words \"Fuhrer Lai\", as well as the slogan \"Green Terror\" – a reference to the DPP's party colour and the White Terror, a period of authoritarian rule and political repression under the Kuomintang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The rhetoric echoed that of Beijing, which has waded into the debate while watching from afar. Its Taiwan Affairs Office has accused Lai of \"engaging in dictatorship under the guise of democracy\" and \"using every means possible to suppress the opposition\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The recall lawmakers were chosen by the majority of voters in their districts. If they are not good enough, they can be voted out in the next election,\" said rally attendee Mu Zili. \"Why should we be using this evil way of getting rid of them?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The 68-year-old night shift worker insisted that the lawmakers were being targeted simply because they belonged to the Kuomintang, and that the Bluebird activists were working for the DPP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"You can't have one party take down the other one in one big recall, this is not democratic,\" Ms Mu said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I side with blue,\" she added, referring to the Kuomintang's party colour. \"But I don't oppose green. I'm here not because I support the Kuomintang, but to protect democracy.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But there are also many Taiwanese who are on the fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Watching the anti-recall rally from the sidelines was Banqiao resident Peggy Lin. Like several other bystanders the BBC spoke to, she was bewildered by the fuss over the Great Recall. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I don't know what it's about really, I haven't followed the debate at all… so I don't have an opinion,\" said the 43-year-old childcare worker.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I will vote after I read more into it and decide based on how I feel on that day about it.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afbe/live/41308a30-6883-11f0-818e-116d88bbdf01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC / Tessa Wong Crowds of people seated at a daytime anti-recall rally in New Taipei hold up large red inflatable sticks, crossing them to indicate their opposition to the Great Recall.

Legislators have brawled in parliament over the political deadlock, while activists have faced doxxing and abuse. Mr Deng told the BBC that while out canvassing, he and his team mates had been assaulted or pushed around by residents opposing the vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vote has also not gone without scandal: officials have discovered numerous forged signatures, many of deceased voters, in recall petitions against both DPP and Kuomintang lawmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vote \"will cement the notion of four year terms as not a given but as conditional on performance and subject to periodic reviews. Political polarisation will likely get worse before it gets better,\" said Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist with the Australian National University's Taiwan Studies programme.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the Great Recall is also \"creating space for renewed political activism\", especially for DPP supporters, added Dr Sung, which he characterised as an overall boon to the resiliency of Taiwan's civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ian Chong, a non-resident scholar with Carnegie China, said if many of the recall votes succeed, \"one signal it would send to politicians in Taiwan is that they should be careful with how far they push the line in public sentiment… they can't stray too far as there would be consequences\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"But if it fizzles out, then it emboldens politicians to do what they want,\" he noted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It will intensify the polarisation… and it would be easy for politicians to write off the Great Recall as yet another civil society movement that doesn't get enough momentum beyond a certain part of the population.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If there was a close but not conclusive result overall, however, it may mean \"the Kuomintang and DPP will have to ultimately seek compromise and work together\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This, added Dr Chong, \"may not be a bad thing for Taiwan\".</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

However, he says, \"Climate change has had an impact: without it, temperatures over the last two weeks would have been lower\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Jeff Weller, University of the Arctic Research Chair at the University of Oulu, agrees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Heatwaves and extreme weather events in summer and winter alike have become so frequent that they can only have been caused by fundamental changes to the climate system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"All over the world, every day, climate change is manifested in extreme heat and extreme precipitation events,\" says Prof Weller. \"The fingerprint of climate change is upon us.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Heatwaves are becoming more common due to human-caused climate change, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Extreme hot weather will happen more often – and become even more intense – as the planet continues to warm, it has said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The extreme heat is also affecting Lapland's famed reindeer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Celebrated worldwide as Santa's sleigh-pullers at Christmas, reindeer here roam freely across forests and fells. But as they're hounded by mosquitoes – which thrive in hot weather – reindeer are now fleeing to roads and villages in search of relief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"For reindeer the only option would be to go to higher, windier elevations but in Finnish Lapland the highest elevation is only about 1,000m (3,300 ft),\" says Prof Weller.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that because more extreme and longer heatwaves will occur more frequently in the Arctic in the future, \"reindeer herders might end up having to build big barns to provide shade for their animals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's not just Santa and his reindeer who are struggling. Lapland is traditionally known as a cool tourist destination – but this year, visitors are puzzled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's super-hot here – 30C is killing me. I came to escape the heat,\" says Silvia, a tourist from Prague visiting Santa's holiday village in Rovaniemi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I expected much colder weather and packed the wrong clothes.

In fact, the argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, when the borders of the two nations were drawn after the French occupation of Cambodia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Things officially became hostile in 2008, when Cambodia tried to register an 11th Century temple located in the disputed area as a Unesco World Heritage Site - a move that was met with heated protest from Thailand.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Over the years there have been sporadic clashes that have seen soldiers and civilians killed on both sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest tensions ramped up in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. This plunged bilateral ties to their lowest point in more than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the past two months, both countries have imposed border restrictions on one another. Cambodia banned imports from Thailand such as fruits and vegetables, and stopped importing power and internet services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both countries have also strengthened troop presence along the border in recent weeks.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What exactly happened on Thursday?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand's National Security Council (NSC) claims that just after 07:30 local time (00:30GMT) on Thursday, Cambodia's military deployed drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shortly afterwards, Cambodian military personnel carrying rocket-propelled grenades gathered near the border. Soldiers on the Thai side attempted negotiations by shouting, but were unsuccessful, the NSC spokesman said, adding that Cambodian soldiers opened fire at around 08:20, forcing the Thai side to retaliate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand has accused Cambodia of deploying heavy weapons, including BM-21 rocket launchers and artillery, causing damage to homes and public facilities including a hospital and a petrol station along the Thai side of the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Cambodia claims that Thai soldiers initiated the conflict at around 06:30, when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border and placing barbed wire around its base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thai soldiers then deployed a drone just after 07:00, and fired shots \"into the air\" at around 08:30, according to Maly Socheata, a spokesperson from Cambodia's Ministry of National Defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 08:46, Thai soldiers \"pre-emptively\" opened fire on Cambodian troops, leaving them no choice but to exercise their right to self-defence, according to the Phnom Penh Post newspaper quoting Socheata.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Socheata further accused Thailand of deploying excessive troops, using heavy weapons and carrying out air strikes on Cambodian territory.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Will this escalate into a full war?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand's acting premier Phumtham Wechayachai said that its dispute with Cambodia remains \"delicate\" and must be addressed with care, and in line with international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said his country wants to resolve the dispute peacefully and that it has \"no choice\" but to \"respond with armed force against armed aggression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While there have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, they de-escalated relatively quickly -  a path our correspondent Jonathan Head thinks will be followed again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, he warns, there's a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to pull back from this confrontation in both countries at the moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">You can read more of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c98j77zde86t?post=asset%3A42bba343-787f-4138-a30c-63e004b4cc3f#post\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">his analysis here</a>.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Is it safe to travel to Thailand and Cambodia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fighting as it stands is very localised, and as yet the British Foreign Office has not issued a specific travel advisory at the time of writing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, it had already urged travellers to take \"extra care\" in the area following the closure of the border crossings in recent weeks - \"especially at tourist destinations such as the Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai temple and the Ta Muen Thom temple\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">You can check the latest travel advice on the FCDO site</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile China has urged its citizens in Cambodia to avoid the Thai border.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"
