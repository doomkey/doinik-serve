They have been charged with drug and weapons offences in New York. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It comes after explosions were reported across the capital Caracas in the early hours of Saturday morning, including at military bases. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government deployed its armed forces and declared a national emergency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's capture comes after heightened tensions between the two countries, with Washington striking boats in the Caribbean it says are being used to carry drugs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has accused the Venezuelan president<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>of being personally involved in drug-smuggling and being an illegitimate leader, while Maduro has accused the US of intimidation and wanting to seize its oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump during a news conference on Saturday said the US would \"run\" Venezuela \"until a safe and proper and judicious transition\", adding that American oil companies would also move into the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here is what we know so far. </p></div><p

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force - the military's top counter terrorism unit, the BBC's US news partner CBS News reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location in the lead-up - part of an extensive intelligence network, CBS said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking alongside Trump on Saturday, Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Operation Absolute Resolve took months of planning and rehearsals, with forces waiting for the right weather.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 150 aircraft were used to get an extraction team into the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The team came in and entered Maduro's compound - \"a house that was more like a fortress\", according to Trump -<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>at 02:01 local time (06:01 GMT) - with the lights in Caracas having been turned off by the Americans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president said Maduro tried to get into a steel-fortified safe place, made it to the door, but was unable to close it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that no US forces were killed and there were \"few\" injuries in the operation, which he said he watched live.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro and his wife were put on a ship<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>and then a plane, which later landed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in New York state, around 60 miles (97km) north of Manhattan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">CBS had reported they were expected to be brought to Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in

appealed for calm and unity, called for the release of Maduro, who she said was the \"only president\", and added that Venezuela would never be a colony of any nation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Saturday, Trump said Rodríguez had been sworn in as president and had spoken to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and told him \"we'll do whatever you need\", Trump said. \"She really doesn't have a choice,\" Trump added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The country's defence minister Vladimir Padrino López earlier claimed the strikes hit civilian areas and said the government was compiling information about dead and injured people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Venezuela would \"resist\" the presence of foreign troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government issued an official statement denouncing the \"extremely serious military aggression\" by the US \"against Venezuelan territory and population in civilian and military locations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also accused the US of threatening international peace and stability and described the attack as an attempt to seize \"Venezuela's strategic resources, particularly its oil and minerals\" in an attempt to \"forcibly break the political independence of the nation\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\"

class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked by reporters about Venezuela's opposition leader and 2025 Nobel Peace winner María Corina Machado, Trump said she did not have support or respect.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on social media, Machado had said \"the hour of freedom has arrived\" and called for Edmundo González Urrutia, who according to vote tallies released by <a

</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Maduro rose to prominence under the leadership of left-wing President Hugo Chávez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). He succeeded Chávez as president in 2013. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Maduro was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3w658z4403o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">declared winner of the presidential election</a>, even though voting tallies collected by the opposition suggested that its candidate, Edmundo González, had won by a landslide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c93n4nx5yqro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">been at odds with Trump</a> over the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in the US and the movement of drugs into the US, in particular fentanyl and cocaine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has designated two Venezuelan drug gangs - Tren de Aragua and Cartel de los Soles - as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTOs) and has alleged that the latter was led by Maduro himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had offered a $50m (£37m) reward for information leading to Maduro's arrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro has vehemently denied being a cartel leader and has accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him and get its hands on Venezuela's vast oil reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent months, US forces have also <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cp8484p7ggmo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">carried out more than two dozen strikes</a> in international waters on boats it alleges have been used to traffick drugs into the US.

She is seen as a powerful political operator in her own right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flores, 59, is colloquially known as Maduro's primera combatiente (first warrior), and has often been pictured at his side during public engagements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like her husband, she was living under US sanctions - which were imposed during Trump's first presidency on the allegation that she was involved in Maduro's corrupt practices. At the time, Maduro hit back by saying: \"You don't mess with Cilia. You don't mess with family.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Flores is a lawyer by training, and she once fought for the release from prison of Hugo Chávez, who tried to seize control of the Venezuelan government in 1992 and later went on to become the country's president.

It doesn't usually send in the military and physically remove them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's abrupt awakening took two forms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its residents were woken abruptly to the sound of deafening booms: the sound of its capital Caracas under attack from US strikes targeting military infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its government has now woken up from any illusion that US military intervention or regime change was just a distant threat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump has announced Venezuela's leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been captured and flown out of the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was a man who wielded a huge amount of power: his government controlled the electoral system, the judiciary, the military, as well as having the loyalty of powerful militia groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By the end of Saturday, he was pictured in a grey tracksuit, his hands bound, his eyes blindfolded, being transported to detention in the US. It was an extraordinary fall from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long accused Maduro of leading a criminal trafficking organisation, something he strongly denies. It designated as a foreign terrorist group the 'Cartel de los Soles' - a name the US uses to describe a group of elites in Venezuela who it alleges orchestrate illegal activities like drug trafficking and illegal mining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro now faces a US trial over weapons and drugs charges. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2953/live/35763f50-e8b2-11f0-b883-037c14a72405.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images A man walks past a graffiti depicting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on January 3, 2026.

But that doesn't make Saturday's events straightforward.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has not carried out direct military intervention in Latin America like this since its 1989 invasion of Panama to depose the then-military ruler, Manuel Noriega.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back then, like now, Washington framed this as part of wider crackdown on drug trafficking and criminality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This latest operation, striking inside a sovereign capital directly, is a dramatic escalation in US engagement in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The forcible removal of Maduro will be hailed a major victory by some of the more hawkish figures within the US administration, many of whom have argued that only direct intervention could force Maduro from power.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington has not recognised him as the country's president since the 2024 elections. The opposition published electronic voting tallies after the vote which it said proved it, not Maduro, won the election. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The result was deemed neither free nor fair by international election observers. The opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was barred from running in it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Venezuela's government, this intervention confirms what it has long claimed - that Washington's ultimate goal is regime change.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has also accused the US of wanting to \"steal\" its oil reserves, the largest in the world, and other resources – an allegation it felt was vindicated after the US seized at least two oil tankers off the coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strikes and capture come after months of US military escalation in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has sent its biggest military deployment in decades to the region, comprising warplanes, thousands of troops, helicopters and the world's largest warship. It has carried out dozens of strikes on alleged small drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing at least 110 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any doubts that remained that those operations were at least in part about regime change too have now been dashed by today's actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains deeply unclear what comes next inside Venezuela itself. Trump has claimed the US will now \"run\" Venezuela but has not clarified what he means by that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Will the US try to push for fresh elections? Will it try to depose further senior members of the government or the military and force them to face justice in the US?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said he was not afraid of putting \"boots on the ground\" and hinted bigger strikes could come if deemed necessary.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5b45/live/972c44b0-e894-11f0-b4b3-f5118369b77f.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, one of Venezuela's largest military bases was hit in Caracas</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More surprisingly, he also said the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado didn't have the \"support or respect\" in Venezuela to take power. She frequently praised Trump and they were allies. Many expected him to back her in any power transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he insinuated he could instead work with Maduro's deputy Delcy Rodriguez saying she was essentially \"willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Rodriguez was part of Maduro's regime. Trump appears to be suggesting they're keen to work with her on a negotiated transition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could this mean leaving power in exchange for not facing the same fate as Maduro? Or assuming power but allying with the US, including for example allowing more access to its vast oil reserves? And if so, how would other Maduro allies who have long-accused the US of imperialist tendencies, and Venezuela's opposition who loathe Maduro's regime, react to that?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Machado has said the opposition's 2024 election candidate Edmundo Gonzalez should \"assume\" the presidency and heralded this action as a day of \"freedom\" for Venezuela. There were celebrations among some Venezuelans in the country and overseas who feel this could mark the end of an authoritarian rule and pave the way for a much freer country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not everyone aligned with the opposition agrees though. Some may be fierce critics of Maduro, but also deeply sceptical of US intervention in the country – not least because of the US's record of backing coups and regime change, some of which led to dictatorships and human rights abuses themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others warn this would not also be simple given the government's grip on power in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It controls the judiciary, the Supreme Court, the military – and is aligned with powerfully armed paramilitaries known as \"colectivos\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some fear US intervention could trigger violent fragmentation and a prolonged power struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Maduro's closest allies, Saturday's events raise urgent questions and fears about their own futures.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many may not want to give up the fight or allow a transition unless they feel they could receive some kind of protection or reassurance from persecution themselves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for Trump, his administration has become increasingly muscular in the region with its financial bailout for Argentina, tariffs on Brazil to try to influence the coup trial of Trump ally and former president Jair Bolsonaro, and now the military intervention in Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He benefits from having more allies in the region now - with the continent shifting rightwards in recent elections in Ecuador, Argentina and Chile. But while Maduro has few allies in the region, some regional powers such as Brazil and Colombia do not support US military intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And some of Trump's own MAGA base in the US are also not happy at his growing interventionism after promising to put \"America First\".</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

But she only fell in love with the brand when she saw a gingerbread house plushie on the Chinese social media app RedNote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas is not widely celebrated in China and is more of a commercial event than anything more traditional. \"The festival doesn't mean a lot to me... But I always like the sight of gingerbread houses,\" she says. It was then that she asked her friend in their hometown Guangzhou to buy it for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was in 2021, just as Jellycat was about to make it big in China and around the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone felt jittery, and no-one knew what would happen,\" says Stella, who has developed a habit of petting and squeezing her plushies since Covid. She had to spend a lot of time at her home, in Beijing, which had some of the strictest lockdowns in China, if not the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now 32, Stella has a new job, as a sales manager in the tourism industry, but is still buying Jellycats. Her collection has grown to 120 toys, costing a total of about 36,000 yuan ($5,145; £3,815).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At my age, there are many things you can't share with others... and the troubles we face are a lot more complicated than before,\" she says with a sigh. \"The plushies help me regulate my emotions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Originally aimed at children, the squishy toys have become a global hit, especially in China where a disenchanted youth has been turning to them for comfort.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The kidults</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stella's Gingerbread house plushie is an \"Amuseable\", a line of toys with tiny faces modelled on inanimate objects from toilet rolls to boiled eggs. The plushies are the \"breakout products\" which \"appeal to a wide Gen-Z and millennial audience\" around the world, says Kasia Davies of global analysis firm Statista.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The popularity of these toys \"may have something to do with wanting to feel companiable\", Isabel Galleymore of the University of Birmingham, in the UK, says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to say for sure whether Jellycat started the now-iconic Amuseable line, which was launched in 2018, to tap into the young adult market. But toy manufacturers need to find a new market given the falling birth rate in much of the world, Ms Davies adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as early as in 2015, Jellycat entered the Chinese market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having done the \"groundwork\", the toy maker was able to capture \"the tone of the pandemic\" – when people sought comfort amid heightened uncertainty – and built on its success in China, says Kathryn Read, a business consultant with 15 years' experience in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jellycat's popularity was further propelled by its pop-up experiences. The in-store events offer a menu of limited-edition \"food\". Many fans film themselves being served and post the clips on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Localisation has also been a core strategy for the Jellycat experience. Fans could buy stuffed toy versions of items like fish, chips and mushy peas at a temporary shop at the department store Selfridges in London.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, teapot and teacup plushies were among the items sold at special outlets in Beijing and Shanghai last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, the UK-based firm's revenue rose by two-thirds to £333m ($459m), <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98dr6yj8dlo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">according to its most recent Companies House accounts</a>. In the same period, it sold about $117m worth of toys to Chinese consumers on major e-commerce platforms, according to estimates by Beijing-based Moojing Market Intelligence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The company's growing popularity mirrors a wider boom in China's collectable-toy market among young adults seeking emotional comfort and connection.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall sales of collectable toys in China are expected to top 110bn yuan this year, according to a 2024 report by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the China Animation Association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The runaway success of Labubu, the elf-like dolls created by Chinese toy maker Pop Mart, highlights the country's growing appetite for collectable toys, especially among young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd04md5rx1no\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">This \"kidult\" trend</a> is not unique to China, as young adults around the world question \"outdated understandings of adulthood\", says Prof Erica Kanesaka, a cultural expert at Emory University in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Global toy sales fell in 2024 - albeit by less than 1% - but collectable toy sales rose by almost 5%, to a record high, according to market research company Circana.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ec6a/live/9571dfa0-d3fd-11f0-8c90-3d44fefc5681.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images Customers shop at jellycat doll store in Shanghai, China.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jellycat had pop-up stores in Shanghai and Beijing</figcaption></p></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44f7/live/75f1be20-c110-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Jellycat Chinese actress Yang Mi, in a white top, holds a matcha latte plushie at the Jellycat pop-up store in Shanghai\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Jellycat</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">In September, Jellycat partnered with A-list actress Yang Mi during a pop-up event in Shanghai</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amuseables, especially the aubergine, which Chinese fans call \"the boss\", have also spawned memes, with many sharing frustrations about adult life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Aubergine boss\" is a hashtag on RedNote, where fans draw different expressions on the plushie. In these memes, the aubergine appears in various moods from drinking to fake-smiling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, Wendy Hui from Hong Kong modified her aubergine Amuseable by drawing dark circles around its eyes and putting a pair of glasses on it. She then posted a picture of it on Threads with the caption: \"The mental state of workers on Monday.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I kept working at home even when I was supposed to be off,\" the 30-something marketing professional says. \"I just wanted to express how exhausted I was.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jellycat has become an unexpected, light-hearted outlet for young Chinese people to air their grievances about a slowing economy, where hard work doesn't guarantee comparable rewards. Despite heavy censorship, the internet has remained an important, if not the only, space for such conversations.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The brand also often launches limited-edition products and retires designs. The strategy, which many in China call \"hunger marketing\", has also helped make Jellycat toys a favourite on social media in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Collecting can feel like a treasure hunt, with fans combing department stores and independent shops for Jellycats when they travel overseas. Some resort to \"daigou\", overseas-based shopping agents. And rare Jellycats, a status symbol among some fans, change hands for more than $1,400.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But most are cheap pick-me-ups amid a sluggish economy plagued by a property crisis and high local government debt. China's youth unemployment rate has eased a little after hitting a record high in August, but official figures show it is still above 17%.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You have to consider for a long time before buying a luxury bag,\" 34-year-old medical sales representative Jessie Chen says. \"But you don't need to do that for a Jellycat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Jellycat also sells bags, which cost just a few hundred yuan [tens of US dollars]. They are practical and can hold a lot of things, so you might change the way you think about luxury goods.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Quitting the pit'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China may have already reached peak Jellycat, with fans noticing less discussion about the toys on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Hui has turned to \"blind boxes\" of toys like Teletubbies - where customers only find out what they have bought when they open the package - as a more thrilling, and cheaper, alternative. She has even considered \"quitting the pit\" - Chinese slang for retiring a hobby.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is so difficult to buy them,\" Stella says. \"Our daily life is not easy already and why should we make things harder for ourselves?\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The STC's advances included the oil-rich Hadramawt province that borders Saudi Arabia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC said the offensive was necessary to \"restore stability\" in the south. But it was denounced as a \"rebellion\" by the head of the PLC, Rashad al-Alimi, who said the STC's separatist push threatened to fracture Yemen and plunge the region into chaos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tensions have further escalated with air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition. On Friday, seven people were killed in an air strike on an STC military camp in Hadramawt, an STC official said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That followed air strikes on Tuesday on the southern port of Mukalla, where the coalition accused the UAE of delivering two ships loaded with military equipment to the separatists over the weekend.

He also led Ukraine's negotiating team in crucial talks with the US aimed at ending the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky wrote on Friday: \"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the defence and security forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Kyrylo has specialist experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president added that he had already instructed his new office chief to update and present key documents regarding \"the strategic foundations\" of Ukraine's defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chief of presidential staff in Ukraine is historically a very powerful position. There was a time in the 2000s when a presidential administration head in Ukraine wielded about as much power as the president himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ostensibly administrative, the role traditionally offered not just close access to the head of state, but also plentiful opportunities to pull the strings of government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For example, the chief of presidential staff could lobby for government appointments and apply pressure to business circles, often resulting in personal gain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's appointment suggests an intention to overhaul the role. It puts the president's office on a war footing - it will very likely be much more focused on security and the war with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later on Friday, Zelensky announced other changes to his top team. He said Fedorov had been nominated to serve as his new defence minister because he had \"decided to change the structure of the Ukrainian ministry of defence\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federov, aged 34, is the youngest minister in the Ukrainian government. His key achievement so far is the development and implementation of Diya, a centralised digital platform for government services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is \"deeply involved with drones\", and will be tasked in particular with training more drone operators, Zelensky said in his evening address. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that Shmyhal remains \"part of the team\" and will be moved to another area of work.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said Budanov was being replaced by 56-year-old foreign intelligence chief Oleh Ivashchenko.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Budanov's predecessor, former chief of staff Yermak, 54, stepped down on 28 November, and his departure was seen as a major blow to Zelensky.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yermak quit shortly after his home in Kyiv was raided by the country's anti-corruption agencies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and the anti-corruption bureau Nabu and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor's office Sap did not explain why they searched his property. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the past few months investigators have linked several high-profile figures to an alleged $100m (£75m) embezzlement scandal in the energy sector. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They said they had uncovered an extensive scheme to take kickbacks and influence state-owned companies including state nuclear energy firm Enerhoatom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The corruption scandal has rocked Ukraine, weakening Zelensky's own position and jeopardising the country's negotiating position at a delicate time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv, backed by its European allies, is seeking to change the terms of a US-led draft peace plan originally seen as heavily slanted towards Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian officials have seized on the scandal, talking up corruption claims.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The first attack - on 2 September - has drawn particular scrutiny as there was not one but two strikes, with survivors of the first hit killed in the second.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court told the BBC that the US military campaign more generally fell into the category of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd9kgqwnk8wo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">a planned, systematic attack against civilians during peacetime</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response, the White House said it had acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels \"trying to bring poison to our shores... destroying American lives\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in October, Trump said he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also threatened strikes on land against what he described as \"narco-terrorists\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said that the first of such strikes had been carried out on 24 December, though he gave little detail, just stating that it had targeted a \"dock area\" where boats alleged to carry drugs where being loaded.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prior to Maduro's capture, Trump repeatedly said that Maduro \"is no friend of the US\" and that it would be \"smart for him to go\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also increased the financial pressure on Maduro by declaring a \"total naval blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Oil is the main source of foreign revenue for the Maduro government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also deployed a huge military force in the Caribbean, whose stated aim is to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as targeting vessels they accuse of smuggling drugs, the force has also played a key role in the US naval blockade. </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is Venezuela flooding the US with drugs?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counternarcotic experts say that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking, acting as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its neighbour, Colombia, is the world's largest producer of cocaine but most of it is thought to enter the US by other routes, not via Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to a US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) report from 2020, almost three quarters of the cocaine reaching the US is estimated to be trafficked via the Pacific with just a small percentage coming via fast boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While most of the early strikes the US has carried out were in the Caribbean, more recent ones have focused on the Pacific.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Trump told US military leaders that the boats targeted \"are stacked up with bags of white powder that's mostly fentanyl and other drugs, too\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fentanyl is a synthetic drug which is 50 times more potent than heroin and has become the main drug responsible for opioid overdose deaths in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 15 December, Trump signed an executive order designating fentanyl as a \"weapon of mass destruction\", arguing that it was \"closer to a chemical weapon than a narcotic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, fentanyl is produced mainly in Mexico and reaches the US almost exclusively via land through its southern border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela is not mentioned as a

using details including the bar design and distinctive pipework.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And there was no evidence the images had been ​​manipulated using artificial intelligence (AI).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In other videos we verified from the night of the fire, some people in the bar can be seen filming the flames as loud club music thumps in the background.

The inspections are carried out by local officials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Swiss authorities said in a press conference that inspections on a building the size of Le Constellation should have been carried out each year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Verify has contacted the OCF to request access to previous inspection documents.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Exit routes from the bar</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say they will also focus on exit routes at the bar, which sits across two levels - a ground floor and a basement. The fire is thought to have started in the basement, where the two images referred to above were taken.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos filmed as the fire took hold show people trying to extinguish the flames before trying to get out of the basement up a narrow set of stairs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Galea said staircase exits can be fatal bottlenecks with people tripping and getting trampled.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\"></figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said even if there were other fire exits, panicked people in unfamiliar spaces were more likely to go out the way they came in.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials also confirmed there was more than one exit from the building, but added they were \"not currently able to say\" whether the emergency exit was open or closed at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Valais state councillor Stéphane Ganzer said: \"There is not just one door, even though at the time of the fire, it seems that most people left through the main entrance. But this building is a public place. It was obviously equipped with an emergency exit.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pilloud told journalists that the two French managers of the bar had been interviewed as well as people who escaped the fire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the bar's owners reportedly told local media the establishment had been inspected three times in the past ten years and that everything had been done according to regulations.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Sparklers used before</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigators say they have also been analysing other videos of the venue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One video we found shows sparklers attached to bottles being used inside the bar as far back as 2024. </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e167/live/92f7dc80-e815-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"YouTube An image taken from a YouTube video posted in 2024 which shows someone holding a bottle with a lit sparkler attached in the air in Le Constellation bar. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">YouTube</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A still image from a YouTube video posted in 2024 showing someone holding a bottle with a sparkler in Le Constellation bar. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It shows women dressed in distinctive crash helmets carrying the bottles and pyrotechnics to customers, before detaching them and pouring drinks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The footage was uploaded to YouTube in May 2024 by the account @ConstellationCransMontana, though we can't be certain when it was filmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Over the last year, an unprecedented 18 condo projects were cancelled in the city, with experts expecting that number will grow as demand continues to plummet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The downturn has reignited debate over whether developers catered too much to real estate investors by building smaller, more affordable units that minimised square footage to keep prices low in areas where land values are high, and which were often designed to be rented out or flipped for profit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Investors own the majority of condos under 600 sq ft in Toronto, according to national database Statistics Canada. Construction of these small units skyrocketed in 2016, and they now make up 38% of condos built in the city, compared with only 7.7% before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These units have not exploded in the same way in the US, where they represent a very small share of the market, though Nadia Evangelou, a senior economist at the National Association of Realtors, said \"their prevalence has roughly doubled over the past decade\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With so much inventory on the market in Canada, some micro-condos that had sold for half a million dollars a few years ago are now reselling for C$300,000 ($217,000; £163,000) or less – a price recently unthinkable in downtown Toronto, which is often cited as one of the most unaffordable cities in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a race to the bottom getting these things sold,\" said Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, an organisation that has been tracking the high-rise market in Toronto for decades. (Shaun Hildebrand is not related to Ms Hildebrand.)</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Why are so many condos sitting empty?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The condo slump is not unique to Toronto, with Vancouver experiencing a similar –albeit smaller – downturn since 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are a few reasons for this, experts tell the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First is an overabundant supply. Thousands of units were  built over the last two years, in part to meet an unprecedented surge in Canada's population driven largely by immigration, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the number of newcomers dropped sharply following a shift in Canada's immigration policies, made partly to address the housing crunch. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://economics.bmo.com/en/publications/detail/8b9b865f-94ef-4161-a81f-bad7ad8c3fd4/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">report released in December by the Bank of Montreal</a> shows that Canada's population saw its largest decline in 2025 on record since the 1940s, barring the 2020 Covid pandemic, driven mainly by new immigration caps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a turn-around that developers could not have predicted, and resulted in more than 60,000 new units completed in recent years to meet a demand that no longer exists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Simply put, \"the market just got way too ahead of itself\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The second reason is pricing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada's central bank lowered interest rates during the pandemic to stimulate the economy, and investors, looking to buy in a real estate market that had seemed like a sure bet for decades, assumed prices could only continue to rise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For a while they did, spiking \"to a level that really made no sense\", Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then, the Bank of Canada began to increase rates to battle post-pandemic inflation. Combined with oversupply, that sure bet became less certain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, some investors are having trouble closing on units they bought pre-construction at those inflated prices. Many have been forced to try and sell them at a significant loss. Others are too spooked to enter the market or are waiting for prices to drop even further, Mr Hildebrand said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is some speculation that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64082923\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Canada's 2022 freeze on foreign home buyers</a>, brought in to help tackle the housing affordability crisis, also played a role. Numbers show that they represent a small fraction of owners – around 2% to 6% – but Mr Hildebrand said it is possible it has sent a signal that Canada is closed for business.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Maggie Hildebrand shares on TikTok what it's like to live in a micro condo</figcaption></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The condo crash and the housing market</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One clear winner from the downturn of the condo market is renters like Ms Hildebrand, who now have more options due to greater supply and slightly better deals on rent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Hildebrand paid C$2,200 a month for her micro-condo. She has since moved to a larger, 700 square-foot, one-bedroom apartment in an older building with a leafy backyard for only C$200 more. She credits the move to a big improvement in her quality of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My birthday is tomorrow, and I'm having a party and hosting 25 people,\" she told the BBC in December. \"A year ago, that was not possible.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Hildebrand said the slump will likely change who developers see as their main customer, shifting from short-term investors seeking quick profits towards longer-term investors and people who plan to settle in the condo they're buying,</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've learned our lesson here,\" he said. The units won't be phased out altogether, he noted, because there is still demand for affordability, \"but we went way too far\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some buyers are benefiting, too. Alex Cruz, a Toronto-based estate agent at Ari Zadegan Group Realty, told the BBC that smaller units were being purchased by those looking for a bargain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If there is a good deal per square foot, people will buy it,\" Mr Cruz said, adding it had given some \"an opportunity to get into the market\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The slump comes as Canada grapples with a housing crisis that has become a central political issue for all levels of government. Prime Minister Mark Carney has promised to double the rate of new homes built in the next decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the construction of thousands of units now put on hold or cancelled, there will be fewer units entering the market by the end of the decade. This could exacerbate Canada's housing crunch, Mr Hildebrand said, as condos are heavily relied on to boost supply in big cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Mr Hildebrand and others warn that the low prices will be short-lived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The question now is how long do we stay here, and what are the implications going to be for the housing supply in the next decade?\" Mr Hildebrand said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

His pitch to lead the most expensive US city included big changes, such as universal childcare, free public buses and city-run grocery stores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the mayor is likely to encounter several challenges in trying to deliver on these promises, and he'll need to keep on board other important political stakeholders - beginning on his first full day in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He'll put all of his political and other might behind getting these things accomplished,\" said Patrick Egan, a professor of politics and public policy at New York University. But, he said, New York City is \"a big place, it's a complicated place, and so, all bets are off about whether these things can happen or not\". </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">1. Paying for policy promises </h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani outlines policy promises during his inaugural address</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's lofty policy platform has centred on cost-of-living issues, including freezing rent hikes for subsidised housing units and providing universal free childcare. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He will be able to accomplish some of his policy goals on his own and without significant expense, government experts said. For instance, if he wants to freeze rents for subsidised housing, he can appoint people aligned with this policy on the city's rent control board.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But finding the funding to make other goals a reality when the state and city face budget shortfalls will prove complicated, government experts said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he wants to provide free bus service and free child care, these kinds of things cost money,\" said Robert Shapiro, a professor of international and public affairs at Columbia University. \"The big roadblock for the things he'd like to do are the state of the New York, the financial capacity of the state and the political willingness of the governor.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has said some funding would come from new taxes. He believes taxes on the wealthy could raise as much as $9bn (£6.6bn), with pledges to raise the corporate tax rate from 7.25% to 11.5%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Mamdani needs the support of the state government to make tax changes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The more moderate Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul endorsed him in the race last year as well as some of his affordability goals. But Hochul, who is making her own political calculations as she runs for re-election this year, has already indicated she may not support Mamdani's broader tax plan. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">2. Avoiding White House intervention </h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: What Trump and Mamdani have said about each other</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For weeks leading up to the New York City mayoral election, President Donald Trump took to social media and news briefings to attack Mamdani, a rising Democratic star, as a \"communist\" mayor who threatened the future of the largest US city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump threatened to withhold billions of federal dollars to the city if Mamdani was elected. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the first meeting between the future mayor and the president last November proved much more amicable than expected. The two men frequently smiled at each other and shared praise, with Trump telling Mamdani he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, the two politicians' diametrically opposed policy positions could lead to conflict as Mamdani takes over City Hall. Immigration may be a point of tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, New York has not been a target of Trump's efforts to send in National Guard troops, as he has done in Democratic-led cities across the US in response to anti-immigration protests. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the Trump administration did ramp up immigration raids in New York as part of its enforcement efforts in several cities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the mayor pledged in his victory speech that New York would \"remain a city of immigrants, a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants, and  ... led by an immigrant\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">3. Getting business leaders on board</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani campaigns on supporting small businesses</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani's shock victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary in June sent Wall Street leaders into a frenzy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some business leaders threatened to leave the city, while others spent millions behind the scenes to try to coalesce support around other mayoral candidates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as Mamdani maintained his status as the race frontrunner, some of these attitudes began to shift. The now-mayor reached out to his opponents in the business world to hear their concerns. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani pledged to meet with leaders including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who later said he would offer his help if Mamdani was elected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani also met with real estate developer Jeffrey Gural, who described him as \"personable\" and \"smart\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, Gural and others in the business community continue to express their concerns that the 34-year-old lacks the experience to lead the nation's largest city - and that his plans to raise taxes on corporations and wealthy people will drive some of them to leave New York. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Egan said it remains to be seen whether a \"spirit of cooperation\" will persist between business leaders and Mamdani as he forges ahead with an agenda that is ideologically at odds with some of their goals. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Any mayor of New York needs cooperation from business leaders, and in particular finance and real estate that play big roles here in New York City,\" he said. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">4. Addressing public safety</h2></p><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mamdani announces a new public safety plan in campaign ad</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As mayor, Mamdani will face a perennial challenge for New York City leaders, tackling crime and maintaining a sense of safety for New Yorkers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like many big cities, New York saw an uptick in crime during the Covid pandemic, though in 2025, the rate of homocides and shootings in the city fell to a near-record low. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This decline in crime gives Mamdani \"a bit of wiggle room to think creatively\" about public safety in New York, including improving social services and support, Mr Egan said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani has promised to create a Department of Community Safety that would invest in mental health programmes and crisis response as well as deploy outreach workers to subway stations across the city.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams' administration also sent outreach workers to subway stations and established other housing and mental health programmes. But some experts and community leaders say those efforts failed to adequately address homelessness and mental health crises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democratic strategist Howard Wolfson, a counselor to former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, said he and others will judge Mamdani first and foremost on how the city is policed, and how shoplifting and quality of life crimes are handled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mamdani won over some business leaders and members of the public with his decision to ask Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who served in Adams' administration, to stay on as police chief. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Public safety is really kind of the prerequisite for success or failure,\" Mr Wolfson previously told the BBC. \"I think if people feel safe here, they can tolerate an awful lot of other challenges. And if they don't, then there's not a lot of other challenges that they will be willing to tolerate.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But last year, Bollywood's violent, male-driven action thrillers dominated the domestic box-office and cultural conversations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last weeks of 2025, Indian social media was swamped with discussions about a single juggernaut: <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q5pygel84o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Dhurandhar, an espionage thriller</a> set in the backdrop of India-Pakistan tensions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Packed with graphic violence and gangland politics, the film became the defining hit of the year, cementing its place in a crop of aggressive, hypermasculine films that drove popular discourse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend was a stark contrast to 2024, when a number of films made by women - Payal Kapadia's All We Imagine As Light, Shuchi Talati's Girls Will Be Girls and Kiran Rao's Laapataa Ladies - got global attention and praise. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What 2024 established was that Indian women filmmakers are not marginal voices, but leading global ones,\" says film critic Mayank Shekhar, calling it \"a moment of truth\" rather than a trend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hope was that richer, more textured stories about women would grow both in number and popularity. Instead, in 2025 the top 10 box-office hits - five of them from Bollywood, a small relief for a Hindi film industry still struggling to regain its footing after the pandemic - were dominated by larger-than-life, hypermasculine heroes, from the historical epic Chhaava to the action spectacle War 2. The only film on the list led by a woman was an outlier: the Malayalam-language superhero film Lokah.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wasn't just action thrillers that put men at the centre. Blockbuster romance Saiyaara followed a troubled male rockstar who ultimately \"rescues\" his partner who is struggling with Alzheimer's disease. Even mythical spectacles such as Kantara: Chapter 1 (Kannada) and Mahavatar Narsimha (dubbed into several languages) doubled down on traditional male heroism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The year's most talked-about films were dominated by images of men performing pain, power and vengeance at full volume.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5363/live/fc711000-e55e-11f0-9eb8-cff2497d71a8.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"T Series Films In a poster for Tere Ishk Mein, actors Dhanush and Kriti Sanon are seen with bloody bruises on their faces\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">T Series Films</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Tere Ishk Mein was southern superstar Dhanush's biggest Hindi film hit</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Out of the top 10, one of the year's most debated hits was Tere Ishk Mein, which features an angry, volatile male protagonist and a high-achieving woman whose ambitions are eclipsed by his obsessive love. Despite criticism for romanticising toxic masculinity, the film became actor Dhanush's highest-grossing Hindi release, earning more than 1,550m rupees ($17.26m, £12.77m) worldwide.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another surprise hit was Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat, a relatively small-budget romance drama with a hero who, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/movie-review/ek-deewane-ki-deewaniyat-movie-review-harshvardhan-rane-sonam-bajwa-film-revives-misogynistic-toxicity-of-darrs-anjaams-tere-naams-10318933/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">as a review put it</a>, is \"an obsessive lover who refuses to take no for an answer\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">2024 offered \"a glimpse of what's possible\", says Priyanka Basu, a senior lecturer in Performing Arts at King's College London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She points out that Hindi cinema has historically marginalised women protagonists, adding that the male-centred industry has long had stark inequalities in casting, pay and opportunities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just one year to change that is unrealistic. We need more such years, and more stories that put women front and centre,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indian cinema's, and especially Bollywood's, fixation with the macho hero goes back to Amitabh Bachchan's \"angry young man\" image of the 1970s. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even the romantic era of superstars like Shah Rukh Khan offered only a brief detour - one he has since abandoned in favour of action-heavy blockbusters such as Pathaan and Jawan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trend has carried onto streaming platforms as well - once seen as alternative spaces where women-centric storytelling could succeed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A recent report by media research company Ormax analysing 338 Hindi shows on streaming platforms showed that action and crime thrillers, mostly male-led, now make up 43% of the titles; female-led stories have fallen from 31% in 2022 to just 12% in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At some point, OTT (over-the-top, or streaming) platforms began chasing box-office logic,\" Mr Shekhar says. \"Streaming now mirrors theatrical trends instead of challenging them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/02e6/live/8ae8d160-e555-11f0-82cc-45c22262bfb4.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Wayfarer Films Actor Kalyani Priyadarshan seen in a red and black vest with bruises on her arm.

Will that change overnight? No. But as the world order changes, so will our films,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's also the economic reality. Producers, distributors and exhibitors control the number of screens, marketing and visibility any film gets - and that often depends on the bankability of the male star. Independent and women-led films face an uphill battle, particularly if they are not fronted by big stars.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Films nowadays are also going through a \"period of performative, exaggerated misogyny\", says screenwriter Atika Chohan, whose work includes women-led films Chhapaak and Margarita With a Straw.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of this, she thinks, is a response to the accountability demanded by women during the MeToo movement of 2017-19.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the movement exposed widespread abuse within the film industry, its impact was uneven. Some of the accused faced temporary setbacks, but most returned to work and structural power imbalances largely remain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As long as these [hypermasculine] films make money, they aren't going anywhere,\" Ms Chohan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But as always, there are signs of hope, mostly from smaller, regional film industries and independent filmmakers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new generation of independent filmmakers in India is making \"riveting, viable cinema\" instead of \"mass entertainers,\" Ms Choudhary points out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sharp indies such as Sabar Bonda and Songs of Forgotten Trees dug into complex social and political layers and told sensitive stories of relationships. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Telugu film The Girlfriend told the story of a woman in a toxic relationship learning to free herself, while Bad Girl (Tamil) was hailed as a successful coming-of-age drama told through a woman's lens. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Malayalam cinema, Feminichi Fathima - with \"Feminichi\" a social-media distortion of \"feminist\" - used humour to follow a Muslim housewife's quiet rebellion against patriarchy. On the streaming side, The Great Shamsuddin Family has been praised for capturing the everyday resilience and complexities of modern Muslim women.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a quieter movement, working from the margins,\" says Ms Choudhary. \"And it isn't going to disappear.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

It made its manufacturer, the small South Korean label CosRX, go global. It is now owned by Amorepacific, the country's biggest cosmetics company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rapid spread of that sticky serum tells you just how wildly successful K-beauty has become. Fuelled by viral content and trends, it is one of the biggest industries in South Korea, where the pressure to look almost flawless has always been huge in a highly competitive society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The domestic market alone was valued at about $13bn (£9.6bn) in 2024, with sales of some products expected to grow at double-digit rates. And the rest of the world is just as obsessed with K-beauty - which is perhaps unsurprising given it's part of the Hallyu, or Korean Wave, which has made K-Pop and K-dramas a global phenomenon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">K-beauty brands now occupy whole sections at global retailers - from Sephora to Boots to Walmart. In the first half of 2025, South Korea overtook France, the birthplace of modern cosmetics, to become the world's second-largest exporter of beauty products, after the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Search for \"Korean skincare\" on TikTok, Instagram or YouTube and you'll be met with a deluge of content from influencers, some of whom have hundreds of millions of followers. They dissect ingredient lists, film unboxings and record \"Get Ready With Me\" videos built around ideas such as \"glass skin\", sheet masks and, of course, snail mucin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are so many products and brands, and a lot of times you're exposed to millions of them as a consumer - it's highly saturated and competitive,\" said Liah Yoo, a beauty influencer and founder of the US-based K-beauty brand Krave Beauty.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The formula behind the rise  </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of K-beauty's rise is a relentless pace of innovation. New formulations appear every few months, often designed to spark the next online obsession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ten-step skincare routines, overnight \"water sleeping masks\" and headline-grabbing ingredients such as salmon sperm were once viewed as niche or unappealing. Today, many are staples in bathroom cabinets from London to Los Angeles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Social media has been central to this shift. Products launched in Seoul are on TikTok and Instagram feeds in the US, UK, India and Australia instantly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are however growing concerns about the social impact of beauty ideals, particularly on young people.

Its portfolio ranges from premium brands such as Sulwhasoo to global mass-market names like Laneige, environmentally focused labels such as Innisfree, and fast-growing independent brands. But even as a chaebol, Amorepacific says it looks to smaller independent brands for fresh ideas.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/39cd/live/8f3702c0-e7fb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend Korean beauty event in New York, October 23, 2025.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Influencer Aylen Park and her mother attend a Korean beauty event organised by Amorepacific and Sephora in New York</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Through the founder and the CosRX team, we were able to learn their approach to formula innovation and how to respond more quickly to consumer needs,\" Mr Kim from Amorepacific said. \"These lessons have since been integrated into our wider organisation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Amorepacific sold about $6.2bn of products.

The BBC visited a sprawling Amorepacific factory outside South Korea's capital Seoul, where a handful of workers oversaw fully automated production lines bottling Laneige's Water Sleeping Mask and CosRX's Vitamin C 23 Serum.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speed, however, comes at a cost. Intense competition has contributed to thin profit margins and high rates of business failures. According to government data, more than 8,800 cosmetics brands have gone out of business in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"South Korea has great infrastructure that can help you create a brand quickly, but growing a successful brand is another story,\" said Ms Yoo. \"It comes down to your brand ethos, your identity, and how different your products are from anything else on the market.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As competition intensifies, brands face growing pressure to be more transparent, and to focus on ingredients and the effectiveness of their products rather than celebrity endorsements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're not just buying from the big brands now. We're actually talking about ingredients, where it's sourced, what it does,\" said Mia Chen, a prominent beauty influencer. \"A lot of Korean skincare derives from natural ingredients, and we all want that on our skin without side effects.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7cb8/live/e4a58830-dbc1-11f0-8c0a-bb33e8d9ed4b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Sydney Sweeney visits the LANEIGE Pop-Up at The Grove LA on March 25, 2024 in Los Angeles, California\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sydney Sweeney is the global ambassador for Amorepacific's Laneige brand</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The industry is also being shaped by its changing market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China is no longer the biggest overseas buyer as its own brands erode the dominance once enjoyed by Japanese and Korean imports.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the first time in 80 years, Amorepacific's North America business overtook the one in China last year, Mr Kim said, adding that the firm also expects growth in Japan, Europe, India and the Middle East.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US remains a key market, importing more beauty products from South Korea than anywhere else. But President Donald Trump's 15% tariffs on Korean imports have sparked some uncertainty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olive Young, South Korea's biggest cosmetics retailer which plans to open its first store in the US this year, imposed a 15% customs duty on American orders.

But when he tried to register for secondary school, he realised he didn't have a birth certificate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been abandoned by his parents - his dad left before he was born and his mum when he was 14 - he could not prove his status.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a painful thing,\" he says. \"You're basically invisible. You don't exist. It's like you're living in the shadows. You don't have a bank account, you can't apply for a decent job that you can earn a living with.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He adds that he tries to stay positive but it's been challenging.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I see my peers, they are done with school now. Whereas I couldn't study further. It's a lot. Depression was once my friend.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arnold is one of at least an estimated 10,000 stateless people living in South Africa who, despite being born here, are struggling to prove their nationality and access public services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no official statistics available on stateless people here because they tend to slip through the cracks. So the figures are based on estimations by organisations like the UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR and civil rights organisations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With no citizenship, stateless people cannot get documents and struggle to get access to basic necessities including education and healthcare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Statelessness is caused by many factors, including administrative barriers and poor record-keeping. As a result the real number of stateless people is hard to gauge in many parts of the world.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f614/live/7e0afd00-df5c-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Ed Habershon / BBC A head and shoulders image of a smiling Christy Chitengu.

It's an entitlement for someone to be able to live a dignified life and for someone to be seen as a human being.
