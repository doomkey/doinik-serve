It's a rude awakening in a moment fraught with grave risk.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US history is littered with consequential and controversial American invasions, occupations, and covert operations to topple rulers and regimes. But, in the past century, no American president has threatened to seize the land of a longtime ally and rule it against their people's will.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No US leader has so brutally broken political norms and threatened long-standing alliances which have underpinned the world order since the end of World War Two.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's little doubt that old rules are being broken, with impunity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is now being described as possibly the US's most \"transformative\" president - cheered by supporters at home and abroad, alarm among others in capitals the world over, and a watchful silence in Moscow and Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a shift toward a world without rules, where international law is trampled underfoot, and where the only law which seems to matter is the strongest with imperial ambitions resurfacing,\" was French President Emmanuel Macron's stark warning on the stage at the Davos Economic Forum, without directly mentioning Trump by name.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\"

eZyhnA\">There is mounting concern over a possible painful trade war, even worry in some circles that the 76-year-old Nato military alliance could now be at risk if, in the worst case scenario, the US commander-in-chief tries to take Greenland by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's defenders are doubling down in support of his \"America First\" agenda, against the post-war multilateral order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When asked on BBC Newshour whether seizing Greenland would violate the UN charter, Republican congressman Randy Fine said: \"I think the United Nations has abjectly failed in being an entity that supports peace in the world and, frankly, whatever they think, probably doing the opposite's the right thing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fine introduced a bill called \"Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act\" in Congress last week.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">How do America's anxious allies respond, when it seems nothing will stand in Trump's way?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many phrases have peppered this past year of diplomatic contortions over how best to deal with the US's unpredictable president and commander-in-chief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We need to take him seriously but not literally,\" comes from those who insist this can all be sorted out through dialogue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's worked, but only to a point, on trying to forge a united response with Europe to Russia's blistering war in Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump often veers, from one week to the next, from espousing positions close to Russia's, then tilting towards Ukraine, then bolting back into Russia's orbit again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's a real estate mogul,\" says those who see in Trump's maximalist positions his deal-making tactics from his New York property days. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's an echo of that in his repeated threats of military action against Iran – although it's clear military options are still on his now crowded table.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He doesn't talk like a traditional politician,\" explains his top diplomat, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio when he is repeatedly questioned about Trump's tactics. \"He says and then he does,\" is his highest praise for his president against what he derides as the dismal record of previous incumbents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rubio has been one of the principal voices trying to backpedal Trump's threats on Greenland, underlining that he wants to buy this vast strategic ice sheet, not invade it. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He pointed out that Trump has been exploring options to purchase the world's largest island, to counter threats from China and Russia, since his first term in office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there is no denying Trump's bully tactics, his contempt for collective action, his belief that might is right.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He is a man of transactions and brute power, mafia style power,\" says Zanny Minton Beddoes, editor-in-chief of the Economist magazine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He doesn't see the benefit of alliances, he doesn't see the idea of America as an idea, a set of values; he doesn't give two hoots about that.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he doesn't hide it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nato is not feared by Russia or China at all. Not even a little bit,\" Trump told the New York Times in a wide-ranging interview earlier this month. \"We're tremendously feared.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If security was the issue, the US already has forces on the ground in Greenland and under a 1951 agreement could send in more troops and open more bases.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I need to own it,\" is how Trump flatly puts it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And he often makes it clear, \"I like to win.\" There's a growing body of proof that's what it is about.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His policy back flips in the past year have been baffling.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/38f7/live/855647e0-f631-11f0-8da1-8d2c3613d51a.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Reuters Caps with slogans supporting Greenland placed on a shelf.

what you are doing on Greenland\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Can't wait to see you\", wrote Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who once called Trump \"daddy\" for his forceful handling of

forcing Nato members to significantly increase their defence spending in recent years. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's warnings, going back to his first term, accelerated a trend called for by previous US presidents and started by Nato members themselves in the shadow of Russian threats.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other side of the Atlantic, the country which has long lived in America's shadow has been trying to forge a different path forward, albeit with challenges of their own.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have to take the world as it is, not

Carney on his trip to China last week.</a></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the first visit by a Canadian leader to Beijing since 2017, after years of sharp tension, and it sent a clear

neighbour to the north surfaced again this week in a post on social media which showed the western hemisphere, including Canada and Greenland, covered in stars and stripes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canadians know there's still a risk they could be next.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney, the former central banker, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgjlqwxevd0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">rose to Canada's highest office last year</a> buoyed by Canadians' belief he was the best prepared to take on Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He responded \"dollar for dollar\" from the start, imposing retaliatory tariffs – until it became too painful for the much smaller Canadian economy, which sends more than 70% of its trade south of its border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Carney took to the stage at Davos on Tuesday, he also focused on this jarring juncture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"American hegemony in particular, helped provide public goods, open sea lanes, a stable financial system, collective security and support for frameworks for resolving disputes,\" he said, adding bluntly: \"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Wednesday Trump will speak from that same podium with the world

His grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, also a former PM, was said to have been close to the group because of its anti-communist stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March last year, a Tokyo court <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge1lr7225yo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">revoked the church's status</a> as a religious corporation, ruling that it coerced followers into buying expensive items by exploiting fears about their spiritual well-being.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The church has also drawn controversy for holding mass wedding ceremonies involving thousands of couples.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yamagami's sister, who appeared as a defence witness during his trial, gave a tearful testimony on the \"dire circumstances she and her siblings endured\" because of their mother's deep involvement with the church, Suzuki recalls.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was an intensely emotional moment. Nearly everyone in the public gallery appeared to be crying,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors argue there is \"a leap in logic\" as to why Yamagami directed his resentment of the church at Abe. During the trial, the judges also raised questions suggesting they found it hard to understand this aspect of his defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Observers, too, are divided on whether Yamagami's personal tragedies justify a reduced penalty for his actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's hard to dismantle the prosecution's case that Abe didn't directly harm Yamagami or his family,\" Suzuki says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he believes Yamagami's case illustrates how \"victims of social problems are led to commit serious crimes\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This chain must be broken, we must properly examine why he committed the crime,\" Suzuki says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rin Ushiyama, a sociologist at Queen's University Belfast, says sympathy for Yamagami is largely rooted in \"widespread distrust and antipathy in Japan towards controversial religions like the Unification Church\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yamagami was certainly a 'victim' of parental neglect and economic hardship caused by the [Unification Church], but this does not explain, let alone justify, his [actions],\" Ushiyama says.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In the US, the Dow Jones slid more than 1.7%, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped more than 2%  and the Nasdaq closed about 2.4% lower.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mixed on Wednesday, with major indexes in Japan and Hong Kong trading a little lower, while shares in Hong Kong and mainland China were slightly higher.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The price of gold continued to make gains as it rose above $4,800 (£3,570) an ounce for the first time. The price of silver dipped from Monday's record high above $95 an ounce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Precious metals are seen as safer assets to hold in times of uncertainty, and the prices of both gold and silver have soared over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the currency markets, the US dollar held steady against its major peers, having dropped 0.5% overnight - the biggest daily fall since early December.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trade tensions between the US and Europe had eased since the two sides struck a deal at Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland in July.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That agreement set US levies on most European goods at 15%, down from the 30% Trump had initially threatened as part of his \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c0m90jjewd7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Liberation Day</a>\" wave of tariffs in April. In exchange, Europe had agreed to invest in the US and make changes at on the continent expected to boost US exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The deal still needs approval from the European Parliament to become official. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Saturday, within hours of Trump's threat of US tariffs over Greenland, Manfred Weber, an influential German member of European Parliament, said \"approval is not possible at this stage\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Bernd Lange, who chairs the European Parliament's committee on international trade, said there was \"no alternative\" but to suspend the deal because of the threats over Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"By threatening the territorial integrity and sovereignty of an EU member state and by using tariffs as a coercive instrument, the US undermines the stability and predictability of EU–US trade relations,\" said Lange, whose committee needs to sign off on the deal before it heads to parliament for a final vote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no alternative but to suspend work on the two Turnberry legislative proposals until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation, and before any further steps are taken.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decision opens up questions about whether the EU will move forward with threats to retaliate against the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bloc had announced a possible €93bn ($109bn, £81bn) worth of American goods that could be hit with levies last year in response to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs before putting the plan on hold, while the two sides finalised details of a deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that reprieve ends on 6 February, meaning EU levies will come into force on 7 February unless the bloc moves for an extension or approves the new deal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron is among those urging the EU to consider its retaliatory options, including the anti-coercion instrument, nicknamed a \"trade bazooka\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington's \"endless accumulation\" of new tariffs is \"fundamentally unacceptable, even more so when they are used as leverage against territorial sovereignty,\" he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">American response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also speaking in Davos, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated his warning to European leaders against retaliation, urging them to \"have an open mind\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I tell everyone, sit back. Take a deep breath. Do not retaliate. The president will be here tomorrow, and he will get his message across,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer warned that the US would not let retaliation go without response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What I've found is that when countries follow my advice, they tend to do okay. When they don't, crazy things happen,\" Greer said, in remarks reported by the Agence France-Presse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydjnlm54po\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">previously expressed impatience with European progress toward approval of the deal</a> amid ongoing disagreements over tech and metals tariffs. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US and the 27-nation European Union are each others' single biggest trade partners, with more than €1.6tn ($1.9tn, £1.4tn) in goods and services exchanged in 2024, according to European figures. That represents nearly a third of all global trade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump started announcing tariffs last year, it prompted threats of retaliation from many political leaders, including in Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the end, however, many, opted to negotiate instead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only China and Canada stuck by their threats to hit American goods with tariffs, with Canada quietly withdrawing most of those measures in September, concerned they were damaging the Canadian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a speech in Davos on Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney urged \"middle powers\" to unite to push back against the might-makes-right world of great power rivalry that he warned was emerging. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we only negotiate bilaterally with a hegemon, we negotiate from weakness. We accept what is offered. We compete with each other to be the most accommodating,\" he warned. \"This is not sovereignty. It is the performance of sovereignty while accepting subordination.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looming in the background of the trade tensions is a pending Supreme Court decision over whether many of the tariffs Trump announced last year are legal. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

two which are part of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, and one from the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, Kaduna state police commissioner Alhaji Muhammad Rabiu told journalists: \"We got a report that 300 people were kidnapped in Kurmin Wali and we sent our officers, soldiers and vigilante and at this time there is no evidence to suggest that a kidnap happened.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He challenged \"anyone to list the names of the kidnapped victims and other particulars.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of Kajuru local government area, which includes Kurmin Wali, Dauda Madaki, said security forces had been sent to the area but found no sign of a kidnapping.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">''We visited the church where the so-called kidnap took place.

They were later released in two successive groups. This was among a spate of kidnappings that made international headlines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria is facing numerous security challenges - including kidnappings for ransom by criminal gangs, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, separatist violence in the south-east, and a battle between herders and farmers in the centre over access to land and water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts say corruption, poor intelligence sharing and underfunded local policing have hampered efforts to tackle the various crises.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nigeria's defence minister resigned last month at the height of the kidnapping crisis, officially for health reasons, according to the president's office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US last month took military action in Nigeria - launching airstrikes on Christmas Day on two camps run by an Islamist militant group in north-western Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US President Donald Trump has followed up by warning of more strikes if Christians continued to be killed in the West African nation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Nigerian foreign ministry spokesman responded to Trump's warning by saying that Nigeria would continue to engage constructively with partners such as the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">''Nigeria remains committed to protecting all citizens, Christians and Muslims alike, without discrimination,'' Alkasim Abdulkadir said.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Categorically, our position hasn't changed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier, a UK government spokesperson said it had acted \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They added that the agreement had secured the operations of the joint US-UK military base \"for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out\", and noted the deal had been welcomed by allies including the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Questioned about his position on the deal at the White House later on Tuesday, Trump said: \"When they originally were going to do it they were talking about doing some concept of ownership, but now they're looking to essentially just do a lease and sell it, and I'm against that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chagos Islands are a \"reasonably important area of the globe\", he said, adding: \"I think they should keep it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't know why they're doing it - do they need money?\" Trump added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mauritius' attorney general Gavin Glover said he still expects the agreement to go ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement he said it was \"important to remember\" that the deal was \"negotiated, concluded and signed exclusively between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Mauritius\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added: \"The sovereignty of the Republic of Mauritius over the Chagos Archipelago is already unambiguously recognised by international law and should no longer be subject to debate.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The agreement followed a long-running dispute between the UK and Mauritius - a former British colony - about sovereignty over the Chagos Islands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius in 1965, when Mauritius was still a British colony. Britain purchased the islands for £3m, but Mauritius has argued that it was illegally forced to give them away as part of a deal to gain independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the deal agreed in May last year, the UK would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the military base on Diego Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It would lease back Diego Garcia for a period of 99 years - at an average cost of £101m a year.

data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria's government has announced a new ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), after the militia alliance withdrew from a camp holding thousands of people with alleged links to the jihadist group Islamic State (IS).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF said its forces were \"compelled\" to leave al-Hol camp and redeploy to other cities in north-east Syria \"due to the international indifference toward the issue of [IS]\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Syria's interior ministry complained that it took place without co-ordination with the government or US-led coalition against IS.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later, the presidency said it had reached an \"understanding\" with the SDF on the future of Hassakeh province, which has a large Kurdish population.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

the state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The presidency also promised that government forces would not enter the cities of Hassakeh and Qamishli, or any Kurdish villages.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, the SDF declared its \"full commitment to the ceasefire\" and said its forces would not initiate any military action unless they were attacked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The SDF also said it was ready to \"move forward with implementing\" the deal reached with the government on Sunday that was supposed to end almost two weeks of

well as the integration of the tens of thousands of SDF fighters into the defence and interior ministries' forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It represents a major blow for the SDF, which had been reluctant to give up the autonomy that it won for Syria's Kurdish minority when helping US-led coalition forces defeat IS militarily during the country's 13-year civil war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to reunify Syria since he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, but the country remains

eZyhnA\">\"Due to the international indifference toward the issue of the IS terrorist organisation and the failure of the international community to assume its responsibilities in addressing this serious matter, our forces were compelled to withdraw from al-Hol camp and redeploy in the vicinity of cities in northern Syria that are facing increasing risks and threats,\" it said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to Kurdish news agency Hawar, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi urged the US-led coalition - once his main ally - to \"bear its responsibilities in protecting facilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We withdrew to predominantly Kurdish areas and protecting them is a red line,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The

But he also said that, in terms of air defence missile prices alone, repelling that attack had cost Ukraine about €80m (£69m).</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Between Monday and Tuesday, at least four people died and 33 others were injured in strikes across Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Air raid alerts in Kyiv lasted most of the night. Sirens rang out later as Russian drones and cruise missiles approached the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning, more than 5,600 residential buildings – each with dozens of flats – in Kyiv woke up to no heating. A large part of the capital also has no water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said almost 80% of those buildings had just had their heating restored following a large-scale attack on 9 January, which knocked out power for much of the city. Since then, relentless efforts by technicians had managed to reinstate electricity and gas for thousands - only for that work to be undone overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have no electricity and no water,\" Oleksandr Palii, a 29-year-old veteran, told the BBC. \"I didn't sleep until 3am because of the strikes either – there were explosions all night.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parliament speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk said that, just like Ukrainian cities, the Verkhovna Rada was also without basic services of electricity, water and heating, and he called other parliaments not to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian president had been due to travel to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday but, in the wake of the overnight strikes, he said he had decided to stay in Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He would travel to Davos only if documents on security guarantees with the United States and a prosperity plan were ready to be signed, he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Temperatures have stayed well below freezing since the start of the year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukrainian media has reported instances of radiators bursting due to the water in them freezing, leading to flooding in entire buildings. There have also been reports of fires starting due to people using gas heaters indoor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the power cuts continue, Kyiv residents are finding innovative solutions to carry on living. Many now use portable stoves to cook, and entire buildings chip in to buy generators. But much depends on individual financial capacities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think people who are less well-off are coping much worse,\" says Olha Zasiadvovk, who has a young child. She and other parents have bought lamps and thermal containers for their children's kindergarten \"so that when the kitchen has no electricity they can cook all the meals at once and store them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if electricity is only available sporadically, she says, \"the food doesn't keep very well. There were cases when food was cooked in the morning and by dinner the porridge had become completely solid.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent days, videos have circulated on social media showing Ukrainians barbecuing in snowy yards and dancing to keep warm in the face of continued power cuts and freezing temperatures. But many say this is the worst winter since the start of the full-scale war in 2022, and with no end to hostilities in sight, nerves are frayed.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed00/live/f33111b0-f5f4-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters People sleeping in a metro station in Kyiv\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Around 10,000 people sought shelter in Kyiv's metro stations overnight</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The resilience of the Ukrainian people cannot be an excuse for this war to continue.

In a call with reporters, he said Russia was using \"far more\" ballistic missiles in its attacks and that Moscow's capacity to produce them had not been dented. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So far, this has not happened. That is why we need more missiles and more air defence systems,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A flurry of diplomatic activity in late 2025 gave rise to hope that progress was being made towards a peace deal with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Tuesday Zelensky hinted at concerns that growing tensions between the US and Europe could be detrimental to Ukraine's ability to defend itself.

In late 2024, he was again named publicly as the head of what authorities described as the \"military wing\" of a broader conspiracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Damiba first seized power in January 2022, toppling the elected government of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré amid frustration over the state's failure to curb Islamist violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But after just eight months, he was himself overthrown by Traoré, then a 34‑year‑old artillery officer who accused him of failing to deliver security improvements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since then, the Traoré-led junta has tightened its grip on the country, expelling French forces, adopting an assertive nationalist stance and recently reinstating the death penalty, including for crimes of high treason.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite promises to restore order, Burkina Faso remains mired in one of the world's most severe security crises, with militant jihadist attacks continuing across large parts of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The return of Damiba to Burkina Faso, under arrest and possibly facing a long list of criminal charges, is expected to escalate tensions within the military and political establishment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Political observers suggest that repeated accusations, foiled plots and widening divisions within the armed forces will likely lead to questions about the stability of a government still confronting both a brutal insurgency and internal rivalries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-natasha-booty\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"additional-reporting-by-natasha-booty\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">Additional reporting by Natasha Booty</b></i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The gun reform measures include a national gun buyback scheme and new checks on firearm licence applications.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said the Bondi gunmen would not legally have had access to firearms if such a law had been in place prior to the attack, the country's worst mass shooting in decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Governing Labor senators were backed on the anti-hate bill by Liberal lawmakers, whose coalition partners abstained.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After last month's mass shooting, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came under huge pressure for not having done enough to prevent the attack in the first place, amid growing fears of antisemitism in the Jewish community. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Politicians were recalled two weeks early to debate the legislation.

The new law will bring in some of the most significant changes to Australia's guns laws since then.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hate speech reforms had originally been included in an omnibus bill with the gun reforms but the government split the legislation last week after both the Liberal-National opposition coalition and the Greens said they would vote against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Labor government has a comfortable majority in the lower house, it needs the support of other parties in the Senate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Coalition MPs cited concerns about free speech and said the legislation was not clearly defined, among other things, while the Greens said they could not support it unless changes were made to protect all minorities and legitimate protest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Tuesday, Liberals leader Sussan Ley, who last week said the bill was \"unsalvageable\", said her party had reached agreement with the government on a watered-down version.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Liberals had \"stepped up to fix legislation\" that the government had \"mishandled\", she said in a statement, adding that the bill had been \"narrowed, strengthened and properly focused on keeping Australians safe\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence. It will be subject to a review every two years by a parliamentary joint committee. The opposition will also be consulted on the listing and delisting of extremist organisations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The bill was passed by the lower house and late in the evening it cleared the Senate - by 38 votes to 22 - after the National Party abstained while their Liberal coalition partners voted in favour.

The inflatable is then towed to the dockside.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The French maritime prefecture declined to comment to the BBC, saying only that there was \"an ongoing judicial investigation\" regarding the small boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">France agreed to the new tactics at a summit in the UK last July between President Emmanuel Macron and Sir Keir Starmer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until then French police had only intervened to stop small boats as they were being prepared for launch on beaches. Intervening at sea was judged to be too dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But smugglers' gangs learned to avoid police by using \"taxi-boats\", which enter the water some distance away and then travel along the coast picking up groups of migrants who themselves enter the water to get aboard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to an official French documents, this method was proving extremely effective, with an 81% success rate in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of migrants who reached the UK from France rose last year from 36,566 in 2024 to 41,472, but it was lower than the peak of 45,774 in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the July 2025 agreement to start on-water interventions, there were more delays because of worries about the risk to life, and about officers' liability to prosecution were migrants to die in an operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These concerns appear now to have been addressed.  Under the terms of engagement, gendarmes will only intervene to stop \"taxi-boats\" before they take on migrants – and not when they are fully charged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This seems to have been the procedure used in Saturday's operation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police suspected that the inflatable, which was moving down the canal to its mouth at the sea, was about to be used for picking up migrants, so they moved to arrest the men on board.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack on Tuesday took place near the Point Plomer campground, about 450km (279 miles) north of Sydney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Steve Pearce, the chief executive of Surf Life Saving NSW, said the surfer was \"very fortunate to not have sustained any serious injuries\", ABC reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We really strongly advocate that nobody swim or surf near river mouths because it's obviously an area where sharks congregate,\" Pearce said. \"If it's dirty water I'd think twice about going in there.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A young surfer had a similarly lucky escape at Dee Why Beach in Sydney on Monday, but a shark attack at nearby Manly hours later left a 27-year-old with \"life-changing\" injuries. On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was also critically injured when bitten at a popular Sydney Harbour beach.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities believe bull sharks were involved in most<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>of the recent<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bull sharks, which can be found in both fresh water and salt water, are \"one of the few sharks that are potentially dangerous to people\", the Australian Museum says. They are the third deadliest shark species, according to the International Shark Attack File.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last November, a woman was killed and a man was seriously injured after being attacked by a bull shark on a remote beach, also on the NSW Mid North coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bull sharks are typically seen around Sydney in January and February - the summer months in Australia - as the \"water is at their preferred temperature\", Dr Daryl McPhee, associate professor of environmental science at Bond University, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Though Australia is a global shark attack hotspot, the chances of being attacked are still minute <b id=\"-\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">- </b>making this string of shark attacks in NSW a rare phenomenon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This series of bites from bull sharks in such a short period of time is highly unusual,\" said McPhee.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police on Monday advised the public to avoid waterways in NSW due to recent weather, which has decreased water quality and visibility.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would recommend not swimming in the harbour or our other river systems across NSW at this time,\" Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rain can concentrate fish that bull sharks prey on downstream in rivers and beaches, McPhee said, adding that \"bull sharks are well adapted to feeding in murky water after rain\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where you find the fish, you find the bull sharks. Unfortunately, that sometimes occurs at popular beach locations.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Trump is due to address delegates at the gathering on Wednesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But speaking on Tuesday morning, the US treasury secretary told reporters there had been an over-reaction to the president's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is the same kind of hysteria we heard on April 2nd. There was a panic. And what I am urging everyone here is sit back, take a deep breath and let things play out,\" Bessent said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The worst thing countries can do is escalate against the United States. Back then only one country, China, escalated. We ended up in an unfortunate tit-for-tat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What the president is threatening on Greenland is very different than the other trade deals so I would urge all countries to stick with their trade deals. We have agreed on them and it does provide great certainty,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked if the US was still an ally of Europe, Bessent accused the media of going to a \"maximalist position\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course Europe is an ally, the US Nato membership is unquestioned, we are partners in trying to stop the tragic war between Russia and Ukraine, but that does not mean that we cannot have disagreements on the future of Greenland,\" he said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Cohn expressed reservations about some of the president's actions, he said the US administration had \"various different motives\" for what they were doing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Trump's decision to intervene in Venezuela was \"a path\" to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly92dkxqvko\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">disrupt the country's relationship</a> with China, the biggest market for its oil, as well as Russia and Cuba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cohn also thinks that the president has become increasingly focused on the importance of rare earth minerals, noting that \"Greenland has quite a supply\" of the resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those minerals are critical to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing – also a major talking point in Davos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">AI 'to be part of every business'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Developments in quantum computing and AI are seen as critical not just for the US economy and productivity, but for US strategic influence in the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"IBM is dead centre in what's going on in quantum today. We have the largest amount of quantum computers in use today,\" Cohn said, highlighting that his company has put many of these computers into use across America in firms from the banking industry to medicine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"AI is going to be the backbone for data that feeds into quantum to solve problems we've never been able to solve,\" he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where we're heading is AI is going to be part of everyone's enterprise. AI and quantum are going to be working in the enterprise behind the scenes to make every company more efficient. And we're just at the beginning of that sort of long road, and that's going to take probably another three to five years to get there.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month, US tech giant Google <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62r6dvpl5ro\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">told the BBC it had the world's best-performing quantum computer</a>.

We reached an agreement with the students in September [2025] and deny any liability in this case,\" the university said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said for them, the point of the lawsuit was not the money. \"It was about making a point - that there are consequences to discriminating against Indians for their 'Indianness'.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit has received significant media coverage in India since it was first reported last week, starting a conversation around what many have described as \"food racism\" in Western countries. Many Indians on social media have shared their own experiences of facing ridicule over their food habits abroad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have also pointed out that discrimination over food is rampant in India as well, where non-vegetarian food is banned in many schools and colleges over perceptions of it being impure or dirty. People from disadvantaged castes and north-eastern states often face bias over their food habits, with some complaining about the smell of the ingredients they use.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And it's not just Indian or South Asian food - communities from Africa, Latin America and other parts of Asia have also shared their experiences of being shamed over their food habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya claim their ordeal began in September 2023. Prakash, a PhD student in the Anthropology Department at the university, was microwaving his lunch of palak paneer when a British staff member allegedly remarked that his food was giving off a \"pungent\" odour and told him that there was a rule against heating foods with strong odours in that microwave.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash said the rule wasn't mentioned anywhere and when he later inquired about which foods were considered pungent, he was told that sandwiches were not, while curry was.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b0f7/live/1de90030-f4e6-11f0-8385-d129002b8603.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of cheese and is mostly eaten with naan, a type of bread, and rice\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Palak paneer is prepared using pureed spinach and cubes of paneer cheese</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash alleged that the exchange was followed by a series of actions by the university which led to him and Bhattacheryya - who was also a PhD student there - losing their research funding, teaching roles and even the PhD advisers they had worked with for months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In May 2025, Prakash and Bhattacheryya filed a lawsuit against the university, alleging discriminatory treatment and a \"pattern of escalating retaliation\" against them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, the university settled the lawsuit.

Loomer has denied being racist.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the lawsuit, Bhattacheryya also alleged she faced retaliation after she invited Prakash to speak as a guest lecturer on the topic of cultural relativism in her anthropology class. Cultural relativism is the view that no culture is superior or inferior to another as cultural practices of all groups exist within their own cultural context.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the lecture, Prakash says he shared several examples of food racism he had encountered, including the palak paneer incident, without naming anyone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bhattacheryya says that she also faced racist abuse when she posted a thread on X about the \"systemic racism\" she and Prakash were facing at the university in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Below the post, there are several comments supporting the couple but also ones that said, \"go back to India\", \"decolonisation was a mistake\" and \"it's not just the food, many of you don't bathe and we know\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prakash and Bhattacheryya said what they wanted from the university was to be heard and understood; for their hurt and pain at being \"othered\" to be acknowledged and for amends to be made in a meaningful way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They claim that they never received a meaningful apology from the university. The university did not respond to the BBC's question about this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have since returned to India and say that they might never go back to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"No matter how good you are at what you do, the system is constantly telling you that because of your skin colour or your nationality, you can be sent back any time.

Sunday's collision, however, took place on the oldest AVE route, that which connects Madrid with Andalusia.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: At the scene of Spain's worst rail disaster in over a decade</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several officials, including the president of Renfe, the national rail operator, Álvaro Fernández Heredia, said that human error was almost certainly not the cause of the accident, given that neither train was travelling at an excessive speed. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska insisted that sabotage was not a possible cause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Inevitably, investigators are looking closely at the train that derailed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Owned by Italian firm Iryo, it was manufactured in 2022. Transport Minister Óscar Puente said that carriage number six of the train was going to be examined closely, because it was the first to derail and it offered \"many pieces of the puzzle\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f90/live/9cf96580-f61d-11f0-a76f-d76034ae9e17.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA People gather to observe a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the train collision that occurred on 18 January, in Punta Umbria, Huelva, Spain, on 20 January 2026.

Most of those issues were related to signalling, and last summer one was discussed in the Senate.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adif has reduced the speed limit for the AVE along a 150km (93 mile) stretch between Madrid and Barcelona, due to concerns about the state of the line. The new limit along that section is 160km/h, nearly half the previous limit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the collision, many social media users have flagged posts from the past in which they had complained about uncomfortable movement while travelling on AVE trains. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One user filmed the interior of a train vigorously vibrating in December, commenting that it had caused them to \"fear for my safety and that of my daughter\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2025, train drivers' union Semaf issued a communiqué warning that the state of a number of AVE lines was causing \"a lack of comfort and reliability\" for those travelling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It called for a reduction in speed limits in order to prevent further degradation of the infrastructure and \"to guarantee the safety of workers and travellers\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a result of Sunday's crash, and the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1m78xl0gmpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">separate derailment of a Rodalies train which killed a driver</a> near Barcelona on Tuesday, Semaf has called a strike. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such grievances might suggest that Spain's high-speed rail network is badly in need of an overhaul. However, the government counters that last year the section of track where the accident took place was renovated, at a cost of €49m (£42m), as part of a broader €700m investment to update the Madrid-Andalusia network in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we find the answer, with absolute transparency we will make it known to Spaniards,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, said of the investigation, as he declared three day's mourning during his visit to Adamuz.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That answer could have enormous significance for the future of Spain's renowned rail system.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Israel insists it's been built without the necessary permits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this deeply divided land so much is contested; from the identities and faiths of the people who live here, to every inch of the ground they stand on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently, that has come to include one small patch of artificial turf laid down under the shadow of the giant concrete wall that isolates Israel from much of the occupied West Bank.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the context of the 7 October attacks, the two-year war in Gaza and the fragility of the current ceasefire, there are without doubt far more pressing issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this is a story freighted with symbolism and one which has drawn outsized international attention because of its connection to that other world religion - football.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the day we visit, a group of Palestinian children are lining up to take penalty shots in the winter sunshine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The construction of the pitch began here on the edge of Bethlehem in 2020, and today it provides a place to practise for more than 200 young players from the nearby Aida refugee camp.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cramped and crowded streets contain the homes of the descendants of Palestinian families who were forced or who fled from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 3 November last year, as the children made their short walk from the camp for that day's training, they found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field declaring it to be illegal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The notice was followed soon by a demolition order.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have anywhere else to play,\" 10-year-old Naya told me, wearing a Brazil shirt with the name of the footballing legend Neymar emblazoned on the back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are building our dreams here,\" she said. \"If they demolish our field, they will demolish our dreams.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked another young player, Mohammed, what his reaction was when he heard the news that the club was earmarked for destruction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I was upset,\" he told me. \"This is a field I really care for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The community has fought back, posting videos on social media, launching a petition attracting hundreds of thousands of signatures, and receiving messages of international support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The club says that after representations from a lawyer it was recently given a seven-day reprieve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But that extension expired on Monday, leaving it with a difficult choice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As is common practice in such cases, the club owners must either demolish the pitch themselves or wait for the Israeli authorities to do it forcibly, after which they'll be presented with the bill.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The looming presence of the wall, which runs along the length of one of the touchlines, is just one of the many complex layers that underpin the Israeli occupation of the territory that Palestinians want as the basis for a future state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Militarily, Israel exerts control over the entirety of the West Bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But administrative control – its day-to-day governance – is divided between a patchwork of Palestinian-run areas and Israeli-run ones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The maps on which those distinctions are based were drawn up as a key part of the Oslo Accords, signed in the 1990s by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The West Bank was split into three categories of territory.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Areas A and B were pockets of land over which the Palestinian Authority was given civil control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In those marked as Area A, Palestinians were also given nominal security control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Area C – more than 60% of the total – was to remain temporarily under full Israeli control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea was that it would eventually be gradually transferred to Palestinian self-rule as the negotiations continued.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While that never happened, with both sides blaming each other for the failure of the peace process, the maps remain the basis for much of how the West Bank is governed today.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bethlehem itself is designated as Area A.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the maps show Israel exercising Area C civil authority over much of the surrounding countryside, right up the city's edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israel began building its concrete barrier in the early 2000s in the face of a wave of deadly suicide bombings and other attacks carried out by Palestinians which killed hundreds of Israelis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Critics claim that today, as it has grown in length, the wall has become a tool for punishing many thousands of ordinary Palestinians, separating them from their workplaces, dividing their communities and effectively annexing parts of their land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But what's now in contention in Bethlehem is a tiny, narrow patch of ground on the Palestinian side of the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the residents of the Aida camp looking for space to build a football field, it was just large enough to accommodate their needs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Israel it remains – and is marked on the maps – as part of Area C, even though the construction of the wall has left it marooned on the Bethlehem side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Satellite photos show that the space was vacant in 2019 and then, year by year, the pitch can be seen beginning to take shape, fitting in snuggly right up against the wall.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The demolition order argues that it was built without the necessary permissions on a plot of land over which Israel still asserts full civil control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div

What do they think of the state of the economy? Are their lives better today than they were a year ago?  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People from across the US and the political spectrum told the BBC about setting food budgets, applying for jobs and more. Here is what some of them had to say.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mary Anne Dagata, 72, Michigan </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-michigander,-a-republican,-has-seen-the-prices-of-basic-food-items-fall-in-her-rural-area-since-trump-returned-to-the-white-house.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-michigander,-a-republican,-has-seen-the-prices-of-basic-food-items-fall-in-her-rural-area-since-trump-returned-to-the-white-house.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This Michigander, a Republican, has seen the prices of basic food items fall in her rural area since Trump returned to the White House. </b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the beginning of the year, things were a lot tougher. Gas was really, really bad and then we had problems with getting food trucked in because I live in a rural area, so prices shot up real crazy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Where other people were complaining about $7 (£5.23) eggs, we had $11 (£8.22) eggs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some days it was like deciding whether the dogs ate or I ate. I'm on social security and I have a budget and I'm allowed food stamps, but I only get $24 a month and that doesn't buy a whole lot. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's much better now, it's like night and day. We're aiming in a better place these days, things have completely come around from where we were a year ago. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Anthony Landaeta, 33, Minnesota</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"an-independent-voter,-this-father-of-an-18-month-old-boy-has-cut-down-his-food-budget-after-he-discovered-the-shockingly-steep-price-tag-for-childcare.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"an-independent-voter,-this-father-of-an-18-month-old-boy-has-cut-down-his-food-budget-after-he-discovered-the-shockingly-steep-price-tag-for-childcare.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">An independent voter, this father of an 18-month-old boy has cut down his food budget after he discovered the shockingly-steep price tag for childcare. </b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It feels like the price of everything is rising. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Childcare costs are about $25,000 per year, which really surprised me. My parents might retire next year, which could help. I work as an engineer in data centres and my wife is an airline pilot, and neither of us want to quit our job to take care of kids.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It feels like Trump doesn't tell the truth about almost anything, so it's hard to know how the economy is actually doing. I'd grade him a 4 out of 10 for the economy, because he talks about it more than he actually does anything to help it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shrinkflation drives me crazy. We bought baby formula, a 32oz bottle, and then a little later when we went to buy it again it came in a 24oz bottle. Same product, just a smaller amount for the same price.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Jim Sullivan, 55, Indiana</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-indiana-republican-backs-the-president-but-feels-he-was-better-off-in-the-first-trump-administration-than-in-the-second...-so-far.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-indiana-republican-backs-the-president-but-feels-he-was-better-off-in-the-first-trump-administration-than-in-the-second...-so-far.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This Indiana Republican backs the president but feels he was better off in the first Trump administration than in the second... so far.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I know inflation is down, allegedly down, but prices for all kinds of other things are super high, electricity, all kinds of things. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I guess a lot of people wanted Trump to enforce immigration, I think that's probably hurting some of the economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's so many things that he could be doing - that he is doing - but he's in so many places I think he just needs to focus in on a few things. He promised the economy would be the primary thing, but I don't know that it's completely been that. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In comparison from what I remember from the last Trump administration, I feel like I was doing a lot better then. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We still have a lot of things that [the Trump administration] is working through, so we'll see. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Devynn De Velasco, 22, Nebraska</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-independent-voter-is-worried-about-how-trump's-focus-on-foreign-policy-will-ultimately-impact-the-us-economy.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This independent voter is worried about how Trump's focus on foreign policy will ultimately impact the US economy.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For the first few months he'd reference the economy, but I can't tell you the last time I've seen reporters questioning Trump about the economy let alone he addresses it on his own. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">My husband and I are honestly worried about an economic collapse. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We've been saving a lot of money - thinking of buying a house - but we have that in the back of our mind that if there is some sort of problem, we do have a full safe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Politics and the economy are very much linked, so what our president does impacts the economy. So the threats to Greenland and Denmark and these remarks about Nato has made me quite anxious. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Denise Demontagnac, 21, Maryland</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-registered-democrat-graduated-from-university-last-year,-and-she-has-not-been-able-to-find-work-since,-despite-a-job-market-the-president-has-touted.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This registered Democrat graduated from university last year, and she has not been able to find work since, despite a job market the president has touted.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One year post graduation, I have not been able to find a stable job which is extremely impacting my life and my family's life as well. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's not that I haven't applied for jobs. I've applied for jobs every single day. It's the fact that people are not hiring, partially because they cannot afford to hire. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You look at interviews where Trump says 'Oh, the job market has never been better, we've created more jobs than have ever been created before'. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As somebody who is actually going through that [market], I don't see the data, I don't see the proof. </p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kai Christianson, 30, Colorado</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"><b id=\"this-financial-consultant,-an-independent-voter,-says-his-finances-are-&quot;marginally-ahead&quot;-of-this-time-last-year,-but-he's-worried-the-gains-won't-last.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\">This financial consultant, an independent voter, says his finances are \"marginally ahead\" of this time last year, but he's worried the gains won't last.</b></i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the campaign trail, Trump consistently brought up all the problems with inflation, and his intent to tackle it very quickly. But once back in office, with this recent geopolitical activity with Iran and Venezuela, I think it has taken a back seat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is clearly an issue for most Americans, and because of that he has kept it as at least a secondary priority. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I think tax breaks have helped push earnings higher for companies and the stock market is doing well because of that. I do not think the policies have created enough growth so that it overshadows the cost increases that we're seeing at the same time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I hope that the Federal Reserve retains enough autonomy to manage independently.
