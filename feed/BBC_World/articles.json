Nearly 150 people affiliated with the government have also been killed, the group said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain,\" Trump told reporters while returning to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once he has the numbers, he said, \"we'll act accordingly.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8276/live/d1dee1d0-f109-11f0-802d-f33b724b1ca5.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Hengaw Organization for Human Rights/X A man with dark hair, a beard and a pierced ear looks at the camera as snow falls around him.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Hengaw Organization for Human Rights/X</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Erfan Soltani, 26, was detained on Thursday last week</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier on Tuesday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Iranian authorities would \"pay a big price\" for the killings, and urged people to \"keep protesting\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY. MIGA!!!,\" he added, using the acronym for a US-based Iranian opposition slogan, \"Make Iran Great Again\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has been weighing military and other options in response to the crackdown, having already announced 25% tariffs on any country trading with Iran.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's government has responded by accusing the US of seeking to \"manufacture a pretext for military intervention\", warning that \"this playbook has failed before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests, which have reportedly spread to 180 cities and towns in all 31 provinces, were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency and soaring cost of living.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They quickly widened into demands for political change and became one of the most serious challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Demonstrations escalated significantly last Thursday and were met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 18,434 protesters have been arrested during the unrest, according to HRANA.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to gauge the true scale of bloodshed because, like other international news organisations, the BBC is not able to report from inside the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, videos posted online on Sunday showed people searching for the bodies of their loved ones at the Kahrizak Forensic Centre in Tehran. The BBC counted at least 180 shrouded bodies and body bags in the footage. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 50 bodies were visible in another video from the facility shared on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My friend went there [Kahrizak] to look for his brother, and he forgot his own sorrow,\" an activist told BBC Persian on Monday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They piled up bodies from every neighbourhood, like Saadatabad, Naziabad, Sattarkhan. So you go to your address pile and search there.

We are short of supplies, short of blood.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other doctors at \"two to three hospitals\" had also said they had treated hundreds of injured or dead people, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An Iranian living in Rasht, near the Caspian Sea coast, described the city as unrecognisable. \"Everywhere is burnt with fire,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UN human rights chief Volker Türk urged Iranian authorities to halt all forms of violence and repression against peaceful protesters immediately, his office said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the labelling of protesters as \"terrorists\" to justify violence was unacceptable and that it was \"extremely worrying\" to see statements from Iranian officials indicating the possibility of the death penalty being used against protesters through expedited trials.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei said on Monday that those involved in the unrest would be \"dealt with seriously and severely\". And prosecutors have said some will be charged with \"enmity against God\", a national security offence that carries the death penalty.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Türk also demanded that Iranian authorities restore full access to the internet and other communication services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some international calls from Iran went through on Tuesday, but the internet shutdown has now passed 132 hours, according to monitor NetBlocks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One person living near Tehran with access via the Starlink satellite service told BBC Persian that there were \"checkpoints in every block\", where cars and the phones of their occupants were being inspected by security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">New videos of protests in recent days have also emerged, with BBC Persian verifying those filmed in the central city of Arak and the western cities of Tabriz, Urmia and Khorramabad.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the footage from Khorramabad, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DTdYTL8k275/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">gunfire can be heard during clashes between security forces and protesters, some of whom are throwing stones</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protesters chant slogans \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to Ayatollah Khamenei - and \"Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace\" - referring to the late monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was overthrown in the 1979 revolution and whose son Reza lives in exile.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

We are not for sale. Our country is not for sale,\" Amelie Zeeb said, removing her chunky mittens, traditionally made here with sealskin and known as  pualuuk, in order to wave her hands for emphasis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My hope is for our country to be independent and well-managed and not be bought,\" said Inuit writer and musician, Sivnîssoq Rask.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Maria, with her seven-week-old baby, wrapped snugly inside her winter coat, told me, \"I worry for the future of my young family. We don't want all this attention here!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But international attention on Greenland is not going to disappear anytime soon. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Far more hangs in the balance than the fate of this island alone.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tussle over Greenland pits Nato nations Denmark and the US against one another.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. The Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that if the US takes control of the island by force, that will be the end of the transatlantic defence alliance that Europe has relied on for security for decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It will also be another damaging blow to US-European relations, already badly bruised since Donald Trump's return to the White House. And remember: Europe's leaders are desperate to keep the Trump administration onside, to back a sustainable peace deal for Ukraine too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The potential ramifications of a fallout over Greenland are huge – but it is unclear how Washington intends to handle Wednesday's meeting. Will the spirit be one of compromise or confrontation?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump insists he needs Greenland for national security. If the US doesn't take Greenland, then China or Russia will, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mindful of this, major European powers, who have vocally supported Danish sovereignty over Greenland, have also been scrambling to come up with military proposals to boost Nato's presence around the island and in the Arctic more broadly. The UK and Germany have taken the lead here, I'm told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We share the US concerns that this part of Denmark needs better protection,\" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Monday. \" We simply want to improve Greenland's security situation together.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of the German Reservists Association, Patrick Sensburg, has called for at least one European brigade to be stationed in Greenland as soon as possible. He stressed that Germany would \"bear special responsibility in the endeavor\", and pointed out that the German army would gain strategic advantages by training soldiers in the challenging Arctic conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The British government is also in talks with European allies regarding the possible deployment of military forces to Greenland, particularly in response to perceived threats from Russia and China.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What has Nato suggested in terms of security in the Arctic?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Talks are at a preliminary stage. Troop numbers have not been defined but the discussions already include the possible deployment of soldiers, warships, aircraft, submarines and anti-drone capabilities in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One concrete suggestion is to form a maritime Nato \"Arctic Sentry\", mirroring the \"Baltic Sentry\" set up by alliance in the Baltic Sea after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seabed of both the Baltic and the Arctic are busy with underwater infrastructure, such as energy pipelines and internet cables, critical for communications and billions of dollars worth of financial transactions daily. All vulnerable to hybrid attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot more can be done in the Arctic,\" Oana Lungescu told me. Until 2023 she was Nato's longest-serving Nato spokesperson. She's now a Distinguished Fellow with the defence and security think-tank RUSI.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't envisage that the UK or Germany will send a significant number of troops to Greenland, but they could hold more exercises in the region or expand existing ones. The UK and other Nato allies have already started deploying maritime assets for a big biannual Norwegian-led exercise in the High North, called Cold Response. The Arctic became a strategic priority for Nato after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. But more needs to be done.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland sits between the US and Canada on one side and Russia and Europe on the other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington first got a real taste of Greenland's strategic value during the Second World War. The US occupied the island to stop it being taken by Nazi Germany after its invasion of Denmark. The US tried to buy Greenland after the war but Copenhagen refused. Not long after, the two countries became founding members of Nato and in 1951 they signed a defence agreement, still valid today, allowing the United States to keep its military bases on Greenland and to bring as many troops to the island as it wished.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is on the shortest route between continental US and Russia, which makes it key for missile defence. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the US greatly reduced its presence here, keeping only one military base - Pituffik Space Base - one of Washington's most important radar stations.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0ef3/live/02cce890-f101-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Exterior shot of the US military Pituffik military base in Greenland \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">US military's Pituffik Space Base in Greenland</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The coastline here is particularly important. There is a maritime choke-point in the waters between Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK gap - that's viewed as crucial to keep an eye on Russian and Chinese ships, and especially submarines moving between the Arctic and Atlantic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had asked Denmark to boost its surveillance capacity. Copenhagen recently pledged $4 billion for Greenland security though the Trump administration has been dismissive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But will Nato proposals for a bigger, better Arctic presence be enough for the Trump administration?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Julianne Smith was the US ambassador to Nato until President Trump's re-election; she is now the president of Clarion Strategies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This week's meeting is absolutely critical,\" she told me. \"I think it will be a turning point one way or another. The representatives from Denmark and Greenland are coming prepared. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are taking this moment very seriously, but the real question is whether any of these proposals will actually satisfy a White House that seems more determined and interested in expanding US territory than actually addressing the security of Greenland itself.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Is this actually about security?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If security was really all that Donald Trump was concerned about, then the Pacific High North is a far more sensitive area of the Arctic for the US than Greenland, argues Ian Lesser, a Distinguished Fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That's where Russian and US presence and interests come into close contact, he told me. In fact, there are two small islands in the middle of the Bering Strait, where you could potentially walk from the United States to Russia in midwinter. Big Diomede is in Russia, and Little Diomede is in the US state of Alaska.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But tensions have risen here since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The waters of the Bering Strait are key to Russia for the transit of strategic nuclear assets and American and Canadian fighter jets have repeatedly been forced to scramble to intercept Russian military planes off the Arctic coast.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ian Lesser believes Donald Trump's focus on Greenland, rather than Alaska, suggests more of an interest in economic security, rather than security in the traditional sense. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, he says, both could be dealt with without touching Danish or Greenlandic sovereignty: Nato could help boost security and defence, and the US could negotiate investment rights in Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is rich in natural resources, including rare earths and minerals that the US and every other global power crave because of their importance to high-tech industries, including advanced defence technologies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington also has its eye on the potential for new, potentially lucrative shipping routes opening up as the Arctic ice melts.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9087/live/b99b0fd0-f0fb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen standing side-by-side at two separate lecterns with microphones during a press conference in Copenhagen, Denmark.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen speaking at a press conference on 13 January in Copenhagen. </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it's hard to see how Donald Trump's appetite for territorial expansionism can leave room for negotiation on Wednesday.  These were his words at the beginning of the week:</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We're talking about acquiring not leasing.... We have bases on Greenland. I could put a lot of soldiers if I want but you need more than that. You need ownership. You really need title.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is a territory of Denmark and therefore politically European, but geographically, it is part of North America. The island is closer to Washington than Copenhagen and Donald Trump seems to have a keen interest in making America great-er in terms of size and dominance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most Greenlanders say they want to be independent of Denmark but even more of them (85% in polls) reject the idea of being American.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of Wednesday's meeting in Washington, Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said his country faced a geopolitical crisis, \"and if we have to choose between the US and Denmark here and now, then we choose Denmark.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But however the meeting with the US vice president and secretary of state goes on Wednesday, Donald Trump is the Joker in the pack of cards, says Sara Olvig of Greenland's Centre for Foreign and Security policy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What will happen will come down to the president,\" she told me. \"And he's very unpredictable.

Russia, he said, was testing Poland's defences and testing Nato's solidarity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Polish president then thanked Britain for sending over <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g7752w1ygo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">RAF Typhoon jets to help defend his borders</a>. He said Poland had been in a state of hybrid war with Russia since 2021, as it dealt with drones and disinformation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Russian grey zone activity showed \"we are living in dangerous times\", he added.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was asked about his friendship with Donald Trump, particularly in the light of the US president's <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c78vj5n7jg3o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">threats to take over \"by any means\" the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland</a>, something which has rattled Europe and which threatens to rupture the 77-year old Nato alliance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, he insisted, despite recent statements by US officials to the contrary, was still the guarantor of security in Europe. What Donald Trump was doing on behalf of the Europeans, he said, \"deserved support and great respect\". President Nawrocki said he could see Europe \"detaching\" itself from the United States and said this was good neither for the economic security nor the military security of the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That still left the awkward question of Greenland. This discussion, he said, should remain a matter between the Danish prime minister and President Trump. Karol Nawrocki was convinced that this question would be resolved through Nato and through dialogue between Denmark and the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But President Nawrocki also used this interview to criticise European leaders for, as he put it, being \"involved in not so important things, in ideological issues such as green deal for instance, climate policy, migration issues\". Europe, he said, was not building its resilience and security over the years, whereas Poland was now allocating close to 5% of its GDP to defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Britain, though, he had some warm words. Relations between Poland and the UK were \"extremely important\" and today around one million Poles lived in the UK. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would like to express my very deep appreciation for the British soldiers who are stationed in Poland... taking responsibility for Nato's Eastern flank,\" he said. He expressed his hope that, with Poland's economy growing rapidly, Britain as host of next year's G20 summit would invite Poland to participate.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Kyiv's Mayor, Vitali Klitschko, somewhat controversially this week also suggested that city residents, who could, should leave Kyiv to help ease pressure on critical resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a comment seized upon by Russia as a sign of resignation and defeatism.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But despite such obvious hardships, most people here in Kyiv remain stoic and are prepared to put up with them.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For Yulia Mykhailiuk, Ihor Honcharuk and their one-year-old son Markiian, that means heating building bricks on a gas stove to try to warm up the rest of their small apartment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flat, in an old Soviet-era apartment block on the east side of the Dnipro river, is a temporary move because their own home was partially damaged in a Russian attack last August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We've had electricity today for something like four minutes,\" Ihor tells me. \"All of our charging stations and power banks have no energy left in them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the first time in a while we have a real winter in Ukraine,\" says Yulia somewhat ironically. \"With this -12 to -16 cold and no heating, the apartment gets cold pretty soon.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ihor and Yulia say they will leave Kyiv temporarily because of the energy crisis</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The large batteries the couple have bought, like many city residents, to charge up when electricity does return are of no use when it comes to heating appliances because they run down so quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, dressing the baby up in multiple layers of clothing is the only solution, but Yulia says at the weekend they will heed Mayor Klitschko's call and temporarily move away from Kyiv to her parents' home outside the city, although she says it's a decision they have made for themselves and not because of pressure from the mayor's office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The energy crisis is not the only reason to move.

Everything is under ice, and repairs of cables and grids are now two to four times more complicated,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Engineers are working to locate and repair damaged cables</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around the clock and across the city, engineers from private energy companies and the municipal authority are repairing power plants hit directly in Russian strikes or installations indirectly affected by them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On another bitterly cold morning we found hardy engineers using mechanical diggers and working with their bare hands to locate and repair damaged power cables which serve the huge multi-occupancy tower blocks on the river's east bank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city authorities have repeatedly asked people and business not to use high-energy consumption devices because they use so much power, and when the electricity supply returns, the surge in demand for power causes the system to collapse – hence the damaged power cables we saw being repaired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the engineer in charge here acknowledged it was a temporary fix.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take years and years. We are currently working literally in emergency modes,\" says Andrii Sobko from Kyiv Electric Networks. \"The equipment is literally operating at its critical parameters so that at least the residents have light.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the war drags on, it's hard to find anyone in Ukraine who has not been directly impacted by the conflict.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kyiv is enduring its fourth winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stanislav or \"Stas\" has also come down to the Invincibility Train to get warm, meet friends and get some power for his phone. The eleven-year-old says his home is very cold and there'd recently been no power in the family's apartment for 36 hours.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recalls with clarity the opening day of the war almost four years ago when he could see bright flashes in the sky - a \"bright orb\" - as Russia launched its attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These days it is the threat of Russian drones that keeps him awake at night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When I hear something flying it's really scary, because you don't know if it will explode now, or if it will fly on and you survive.\"  As we perch on the top bunk of the carriage where he is sitting with another friend, Stas is frank about the impact of the war on his generation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I forget the times when there was no war, I don't remember those moments – life is difficult,\" says Stas, his smile wide and demeanour remarkably bubbly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are all kinds of people seeking warmth, comfort or company on the train. But my next conversation with an elderly lady, who says her discomfort is nothing compared with what soldiers on the front are enduring, is abruptly cut short as the familiar high-pitched sound of an air raid alert rings out on our phones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The conductor orders everyone off the train and directs them to a shelter, about a kilometre away. Most head home instead, to the cold and their interrupted power supplies but all - including Stas and Alina - say they'll be back tomorrow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Everyone in Kyiv is putting a brave face on things. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This extraordinarily cold winter, even by Ukrainian standards, will not last for much more than a couple of months and the energy crisis will ease. What most people fear is that, despite some optimism at the end of last year, there is no end in sight to the war itself and the inevitable loss of life.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

She was 86 years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin's protest, which led to her arrest, came in 1955 at the age of 15 while she was living in Montgomery, Alabama. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It happened nine months before the arrest of Rosa Parks, who also famously refused to give her bus seat to a white person, in a move that led to widespread boycotting of public transportation in the city, and a Supreme Court decision that outlawed such racial discrimination. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin's arrest was largely unknown until 2009, when the first detailed book about her experience was published. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"She leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history,\" said a statement from the Claudette Colvin Legacy Foundation, which announced her death.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One year after her arrest, the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation on buses must end. The legal case turned on the testimony of four plaintiffs, one of whom was Colvin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with the BBC in 2018, Ms Colvin recalled that she \"was not frightened, but disappointed and angry\" because she knew she \"was sitting in the right seat\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was the first person to be arrested for challenging Montgomery's bus segregation policies, but her story remained relatively unknown for decades. It was Rosa Parks who became one of the main figures of the civil rights movement after her very similar case led to the large-scale boycott of the bus system in the city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colvin said she had been inspired by the great anti-slavery campaigners Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Whenever people ask me: 'Why didn't you get up when the bus driver asked you?' I say it felt as though Harriet Tubman's hands were pushing me down on one shoulder and Sojourner Truth's hands were pushing me down on the other shoulder,\" she told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Later in life, she became a nurse in New York. According to her organisation, she died in Texas.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The two leaders also exchanged signed drumsticks after their performance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When we met at APEC last year, [Lee] said it was his dream to play the drums, so we prepared a surprise,\" Takaichi later wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Footage of the jam session has won praise on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Music seems to have the power to connect hearts at a deeper level than words ever could,\" one X user wrote in Korean. \"Exchanges like this may be quiet, but they will surely help move relations between Korea and Japan forward.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There have long been sore spots between the two neighbours, including historical grievances from Japan's colonial rule and territorial disputes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But both countries are allies of the US, and have worked together to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, Takaichi said in a statement that cooperation between Japan, South Korea and the US has become increasingly important amid heightened tensions in the region's \"strategic environment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee and Takaichi have also agreed to boost economic cooperation - a pledge that comes as China has been tightening its export of rare earths and dual-use goods to Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Just seeing them actually playing drums together - not just posing - looks like they are having so much fun, and that's what matters most,\" an X user wrote in Japanese. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Both Korea and Japan are facing tough situations, but if we can meet each other halfway, I truly believe things will move in a positive direction.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee's smoothness as a diplomat has boosted his approval ratings back home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Days before his viral jam session with Takaichi, he met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, with whom he took selfies on a Chinese smartphone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last October, he flattered US President Donald Trump with a large golden crown. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only leader he hasn't been able to charm is North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Pyongyang has rejected Lee's overtures for peace and shown little interest in reconciliation. This week, Pyongyang demanded an apology from Seoul after accusing it of flying surveillance drones in its territory.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee's rise to become president of South Korea had previously sounded alarm bells in Tokyo and Washington. Relatively unknown outside his own country at the time, Lee had a reputation as a firebrand who was sympathetic to socialist economic causes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US feared South Korea would tilt towards China, South Korea's largest trading partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Japan, meanwhile, feared a repeat of a spat in 2019, when South Korea threatened to pull out of an intelligence-sharing agreement after Japan tightened its exports to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That fight broke out after a South Korean court ordered Japanese companies to compensate the survivors of Japan's wartime forced labour, an issue Japan now considers resolved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since taking office, however, Lee has walked a diplomatic tightrope among the region's major powers, from the US to China and now Japan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lee heaped praise on Takaichi's drumming skills in a post on X, and likened their diplomatic efforts to the musical duet.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if our timing was slightly different, our intention to find the same rhythm was shared,\" he wrote. \"In that same spirit, we will continue to build a future-oriented Korea–Japan relationship together, with one heart.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

Chinese customers must also show \"sufficient security procedures\" and cannot use the chips for military uses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The H200 chip is a generation behind Nvidia's Blackwell processor, which is considered to be the world's most advanced AI semiconductor and remains blocked from sale in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese embassy spokesman Liu Pengyu told the BBC on Wednesday that Beijing has consistently opposed the \"politicisation and weaponisation of tech and trade issues\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We oppose blocking and restricting China, which disrupts the stability of industrial and supply chains,\" he said. \"This approach does not serve the common interests of both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia has been caught in a geopolitical tug-of-war between the US and China - two sides of a global AI race.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump reversed the chip-selling restriction last July, but demanded that Nvidia pay a cut of its earnings from China to the US government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing then reportedly ordered its tech companies to boycott Nvidia's China-bound chips and prioritise semiconductors made domestically. That move was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmz2vm3yv8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">designed to bolster China's tech industry</a>, though experts have consistently said that the country's chips still lag behind the US.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout 2025, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang continually <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxz29pe1v0o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">lobbied Washington</a> to allow the sale of the firm's high-powered chips to China, arguing that global market excess is essential for America's competitiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some officials in the US, however, have expressed concerns that the chips would benefit  Beijing's military and hurt America's progress in AI development.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Beijing is likely concerned about domestic firms becoming over-reliant on Nvidia, local firms will be eager to secure H200 chips - at least until homegrown alternatives get better, said semiconductor analyst Austin Lyons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nvidia will also be happy to get any revenue from China, even if it comes at a lower margin due to the US government taking a cut of the sales, Lyons added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's \"unique\" proposal to collect a cut of Nvidia's sales could also set a precedent for his negotiations in other trade tariffs, said Marc Einstein from Counterpoint Research.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will be interesting to see if this tariff model expands to other sectors.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

President Donald Trump has said he did not \"know anything\" about the investigation.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The probe is linked to testimony Powell gave to a Senate committee about renovations to Federal Reserve buildings. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It follows a year of relentless attacks on the Fed chair by Trump, who has pushed the Fed to lower borrowing costs more aggressively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as criticising Powell's decisions on interest rates, Trump has made personal comments, calling the Fed chair a \"major loser\" and a \"numbskull\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Commenting on the Fed chair, the global central bankers said in their joint statement: \"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Until the weekend, Powell had stayed largely silent in the face of Trump's attacks but on Sunday, he publicly pushed back and warned that the independence of the US central bank was at stake.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Fed has cut interest rates three times since September, leaving its key lending rate at around 3.6%. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But policymakers are divided about what to do next. Some are worried additional reductions could stoke inflation, which continues to bubble. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumer prices rose 2.7% over the 12 months to December, according to official figures published on Tuesday. That was the same rate as in November and remained higher than the Fed's 2% target. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their joint statement on Tuesday, the international financial institutions said: \"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Powell, who Trump nominated as Fed chair in 2017 during his first term in the White House, is set to step down in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump is expected to name his successor in the coming weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Republicans have spoken out against the justice department's move against the Fed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, until the matter was \"fully resolved\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The committee must approve the next Fed nominee so if Tillis keeps that pledge, it could delay the nomination of any Trump pick to replace Powell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His Republican colleague on the committee, Senator Kevin Cramer, said he thought Powell was a poor Fed chairman but did not believe he was a criminal. To restore confidence in the Fed, he added, the investigation should be swift.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski, described the investigation as \"an attempt at coercion\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Powell has also been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c394xwdve9lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">backed by three former chairs of the Fed</a> - Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan.

The Dubai chewy cookie has been selling like wildfire - and even restaurants that don't usually offer baked goods are trying to get a nibble of the market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite its name, the cookie's texture more closely resembles a rice cake, and is made by stuffing pistachio cream and knafeh shreds into a chocolate marshmallow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shops are selling hundreds of cookies within minutes and the frenzy has sent prices of key ingredients surging, local media reported.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This South Korean twist on the viral Dubai dessert first took off last September, after Jang Won-young from the girl band Ive posted a photograph of the chewy cookie on Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While they currently sell for between 5,000 ($3; £2.5) and 10,000 won, prices are expected to climb due to strong demand. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And apart from dessert shops and bakeries, other restaurants - from sushi bars to cold-noodle shops - are now offering the dessert. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local convenience store chain CU launched its Dubai chewy rice cake in October, and has sold some 1.8 million pieces of it in the last few months. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our manufacturing plant's production capacity cannot keep up with demand,\" a company representative told Yonhap News.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So obsessed are the South Koreans with the cookie that someone even created a map that tracks shops selling the dessert, as well as their stock levels, in real time. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some stores have started imposing limits on how many cookies each customer can buy. The trend has also sparked online chatter among gig workers on whether hardware stores and cleaning companies should also start cashing in on Dubai chewy cookies, The Korea Herald reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such demand has driven up the price of pistachios, with local media reporting that a major supermarket chain has raised prices by 20% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counterfeits have also emerged, spurring some consumers to call them out in their online reviews. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I bought two for 11,000 Korean won, but there's no knafeh, and the exterior isn't marshmallow. It's heartbreaking,\" wrote one, in a review quoted by The Chosun Daily.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several food critics say the Dubai chewy cookies have taken off in South Korea because of how thick and dense they are.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It reflects Korean food culture, where visual overwhelmingness matters more than balance or harmony of ingredients and flavours,\" food critic Lee Yong-jae told The Chosun Daily. </p></div></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors have asked for South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol to be handed a death sentence if he is found guilty over his botched attempt to impose martial law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A court in Seoul heard closing arguments in Yoon's trial, in which he was accused of being the \"ringleader of an insurrection\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The charge stems from Yoon's attempt in December 2024 to impose military rule in South Korea - an act that lasted just hours but plunged the country into political turmoil. He was later impeached by parliament and detained to face trial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon has denied the charges against him, arguing that martial law was a symbolic gesture to draw public attention to the wrongdoings of the opposition party.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Leading an insurrection - the most serious charge against Yoon - carries sentences of the death penalty, or life imprisonment. Under South Korean law, prosecutors had to ask the judge for either one sentence or the other.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea has not executed anyone in nearly 30 years. In 1996, former military dictator Chun Doo-hwan was given the death penalty for seizing power in a military coup in 1979, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The prosecutors in Yoon's case argue that although no one was killed in his martial law attempt, Yoon's intent was no less violent. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Closing their arguments at Seoul Central District Court on Tuesday, prosecutors said the former president had been motivated by a \"lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The greatest victims of the insurrection in this case are the people of this country,\" they told the court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are no mitigating circumstances to be considered in sentencing, and instead a severe punishment must be imposed,\" they said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors had called to the stand the military commander who testified that Yoon had ordered the arrest of lawmakers during his abortive coup. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also presented as evidence the memo made by one of the planners of the martial law, a former military officer, containing the suggestion of \"disposing\" of hundreds of people including journalists, labour activists and lawmakers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon's insurrection trial has been merged with those of two other senior figures in his administration, former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors sought life imprisonment for Kim, and 20 years in jail for Cho for carrying out Yoon's illegal orders. There are five other defendants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon was in court to hear the final legal arguments. He has argued that as president, he had the power to declare martial law. Yoon was quoted by Yonhap news agency as saying he had done so to fend off the \"wickedness that would ruin the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Legal arguments were expected to end last Friday, but continued into Tuesday amid reports defence lawyers had delayed proceedings.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court is expected to deliver its verdict in February. Sentences sought by prosecutors are not always upheld in courts in South Korea.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yoon, 65, was removed from office in April, and is the country's first sitting president to be taken into custody. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has been detained for months while facing several criminal trials. Last month, prosecutors sought a 10-year prison term for Yoon for obstruction of justice and other charges related to his martial law attempt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 3 December 2024, Yoon shocked the country - and the world - by declaring martial law over South Korea. He said at the time it was to protect the country from North Korean communist forces, but some saw it as a ploy by Yoon to get a grip on power amid domestic political woes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The short-lived martial law declaration sent South Korea into months of political turmoil, while Yoon became South Korea's first sitting president to be arrested and charged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Korea's incumbent president, Lee Jae Myung, was elected in June following a snap election after Yoon's impeachment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his downfall, Yoon retains loyal supporters in right-wing circles who see him as a martyr who dared to rail against the liberal Democratic Party led by Lee.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Clinton also visited Epstein's New York apartment around that time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Citing flight logs, US media have previously reported Clinton flew on Epstein's jet more than two dozen times, occasionally without his Secret Service detail.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress has the authority to detain someone until they comply with a subpoena, send a contempt certification to the justice department for prosecution or ask a court to force compliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the court finds that the party is legally obligated to comply, continued non-compliance may result in the party being held in contempt of court,\" according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Where the target of the subpoena is an executive branch official, civil enforcement may be the only practical means by which Congress can effectively ensure compliance with its own subpoena.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Criminal contempt of Congress is a misdemeanour offence punishable by a fine up to  $100,000 (£74,500) and imprisonment up to a year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the last year, lawmakers from both parties have pushed to learn about Epstein's associations with powerful people and passed a law demanding that the justice department release all  files from federal investigations into the sex offender by the middle of December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After the department only released a portion of the files, the legislation's authors - Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna - went to court last week and asked a federal judge to appoint a special master to make sure the government complies with its requirements.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Starting March 17, around 2,500 Somalis will lose their work authorisations and legal status, making them eligible for deportation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump has made it known he does not want Somali immigrants in the US, and has launched a major effort in Minneapolis to detain and deport people in the country illegally.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Temporary means temporary,\" Noem said in a statement to the BBC. \"Further, allowing Somali nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interests. We are putting Americans first.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congress established TPS in 1990 to give refuge to people from countries that experienced war or environmental disasters. Immigrants with TPS authorisation are typically allowed to live and work legally in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the BBC that there are 2,471 Somali nationals with TPS, and 1,383 people with pending applications. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">DHS responded to an online post about the announcement that the protective status was ending for those people with a Trump portrait carrying the caption: \"I am the captain now.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Noem last month announced a surge of immigration officers in Minnesota, home to a large Somali diaspora community and where a sprawling federal fraud investigation found problems in the state's childcare industry, which the administration has linked to Somali immigrants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jonathan Ross, an immigration enforcement agent, fatally shot US citizen Renee Good in her car last week during the Minneapolis operation sparking large protests locally and nationally. The Trump administration says the agent acted in self-defence but local officials insist the woman posed no danger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has for months said he wants Somali immigrants to leave, saying they should \"go back to where they came from\" and \"their country is no good for a reason\". Trump also said the US would \"go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ahead of Tuesday's announcement, Trump also posted online saying \"FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA, THE DAY OF RECKONING &amp; RETRIBUTION IS COMING!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">TPS for Somalia was first designated in 1991 by Republican President George H W Bush, following the outbreak of civil war in the country, and has been renewed since then by both Democratic and Republican presidents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Biden administration had renewed TPS for Somalia for the maximum 18 months allowed under the law, which are set to end in March.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the last year, the Trump administration has moved to end TPS for immigrants from other countries previously deemed unsafe, including Venezuela, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Nepal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those attempts have been challenged int he courts and in September a federal judge ruled that a move to end TPS for Haitians and Venezuelans was unlawful.</p></div></div></body></html>"

She was handed a €100,000 (£82,635) fine and banned from seeking public office \"with immediate effect\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 20 RN figures were also found guilty in last year's trial and the party was ordered to pay a €2m fine, with half the amount suspended. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eleven of Le Pen's colleagues are taking part in the Paris appeal, but 12 have decided not to challenge the original verdicts, including her sister Yann Le Pen who was given a one-year suspended prison term.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With Le Pen standing, presiding judge Michèle Agi started the hearing by reading the charges and last-year's verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The RN leader then returned to her seat, in the company of some of the other co-defendants and her lawyers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Judge Agi then read a report summarising facts of the case, after which Le Pen and her co-defendants took the floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We have never concealed anything, neither in the publication of our organisational charts, nor in the contracts filed, nor in the numerous press articles,\" the RN leader said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the French legal system, an appeals court reviews the decision of the lower, first-instance court in its entirety - including facts as well as points of law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Le Pen will be hoping the Paris appeals court overturns last year's verdict and clears her name and path to run for the highest office in France for the fourth time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A second possible outcome would be for the appeals panel to affirm the guilty verdict but remove the \"immediate effect\" clause. This would enable her to run even if she decided to appeal to the country's highest court – the Court of Cassation – to overturn the guilty verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A third outcome could see the appeals judges curtail the five-year ban sufficiently to enable Le Pen to register by the March 2027 deadline.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And a fourth would be to leave the lower court's decisions intact. This would make it next to impossible to run – even though she would still be expected to take the case to the Court of Cassation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fifth - which would definitely rule Le Pen out of the race - would be for the original conviction to be upheld and the sentence to be stiffened. After all, the offence may be punishable with up to 10 years in jail.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the presidential election expected to be held around April 2027, much will depend on the substance – as well as the timing – of the judgements. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The far-right leader has twice made it to the run-off stage and many of her supporters think she has a chance of winning if she is cleared to run next year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday, the president of her National Rally party, Jordan Bardella, said barring her from the election would be \"deeply worrying for democracy\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bardella said he would not stand for president but would instead seek the lower-ranking post of prime minister.   </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An opinion poll - published by Le Monde newspaper on the eve of the appeal - suggested Bardella may have a better chance of winning the French presidency - 49% against 18% for Le Pen.</p></div></div></body></html>"

He died pretty quickly from his injuries,\" said Corsican prosecutor Nicolas Septe.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We'd just finished burying Alain's mother - it was a moment of pain and grief,\" said Father Roger-Dominique Polge who had led the funeral service.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Suddenly we hear a gunshot and Alain falls down dead. In the middle of a cemetery, after a religious ceremony, I ask where are we, what kind of home are we living in? It's as if Corsica is worse than Sicily - it's unimaginable.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No motive is yet known but Orsoni was for decades a high-profile figure in Corsican society and his graveyard murder in his native village shines a light on the criminal clans that have blighted the island.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The investigation into his murder is being handled by a newly created national anti-organised crime prosecutor alongside the Marseille-based specialised regional crime office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A police source told Le Monde newspaper there were similarities with recent gangland killings targeting people linked to Orsoni's son, Guy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2023, two of Guy Orsoni's associates were shot dead, both by a gunman firing from some distance away. Guy Orsoni is himself serving a 13-year jail term for the attempted murder of a member of the so-called Petit Bar gang in 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alain Orsoni led a storied life in Corsica and abroad. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Renowned for his good looks and rich singing voice, he became attracted to Corsican nationalism in the 1970s and took part in a gun attack in front of the Iranian embassy in 1980. Three years later his brother was kidnapped and presumed murdered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Father, brother and son all found themselves thrust over time into the heart of politics and criminal cases,\" criminologist Alain Bauer told Ouest-France newspaper.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alain Orsoni later founded the separatist Movement for Self-Determination (MPA), which won four seats in elections in 1992. He was unable to take up his seat because of campaign irregularities and later spent time in jail for a series of offences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amid violent splits among Corsican nationalist leaders, he left the island for Central America in 1996, eventually returning to become president of football club AC Ajaccio in 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Weeks after his return, police thwarted a plot to kill him by the Petit Bar gang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His role at AC Ajaccio ended in 2015 but he returned as club president in 2022, before returning to exile in Nicaragua and then resigning from his post in September last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was long aware of the risk to his life and, after the killing of four of his associates over a two-year period, he told Le Figaro newspaper in 2012 that he had bought an armoured car under pressure from his family after he was targeted in 2008.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not afraid of dying. I don't wake up every morning thinking I'm going to be killed. I live a normal life, without a squad of bodyguards,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm portrayed as a godfather, even though I don't even own a business on Corsica.

The defence department was \"aware of the litigation,\" a spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As a matter of policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kelly had a prominent career as an astronaut before being elected to the US Senate for Arizona in 2020. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also founded a gun safety group along with his wife, former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head at an event in 2011 and survived.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He staked out a position as a centrist Democrat focused on defence, and has criticised Trump's use of National Guard troops to patrol US cities. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, Washington DC, and elsewhere has sparked major court battles. The Trump administration argues that the forces are necessary to suppress crime, and to protect federal immigration agents as they conduct sweeps in major US cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, Kelly, along with five other Democrats, filmed a video that told military personnel: \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The video irked Trump, who posted \"LOCK THEM UP???\" on Truth Social. The president's account also reshared another user's post, that read, \"HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD !!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump later clarified to Fox News: \"I'm not threatening death, but I think they're in serious trouble.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hegseth then announced he would open retirement-grade determination proceedings against Kelly and issue a formal letter of censure. He described Kelly's comments as \"seditious in nature\" and a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The case filed by Kelly argues that Hegseth \"is disciplining Senator Kelly solely for the content and viewpoint of his political speech\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kelly also alleges that Hegseth did not have a legal basis to open a review of Kelly's retirement grade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nothing in the statute authorizes the Department of Defense to reopen that determination based on post-retirement political speech - and if it did, it would raise serious constitutional concerns and subject all of the nation's retired veterans to an ever-present threat against their retirement,\" the case states.</p></div></div></body></html>"

The car turns away from the officers and crashes on the side of the road.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local and state officials say the videos demonstrate that Good was not a threat as she was turning away from the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials, meanwhile, say the videos are evidence that Good was trying to drive her car into the officer and that his only choice was to use deadly force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former law enforcement officials told the BBC that judgements from both sides of the argument should have been withheld until a full investigation had been completed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a politically charged situation where people on both the left and on the right have come to their conclusions before the investigation even started,\" said Ken Gray, a former FBI agent and a professor at the University of New Haven's Criminal Justice Department.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Justifying deadly force</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9d39/live/9d9bcb10-effe-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock A woman wearing a dark jacket with a hood over her head holds a candle and a picture of a Minneapolis woman fatally shot by an agent of ICE, the US  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">TOLGA AKMEN/EPA/Shutterstock</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The shooting last week led to protests around the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When analysing whether the ICE officer was justified in shooting Good, investigators will have to compare Ross's actions in the videos to the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) policy on the use of deadly force. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former law enforcement agents said a previous episode in which Ross was injured on duty - as well as the quick determinations he had to make about the threat level - will likely be seen by federal investigators as providing that official justification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under DHS policy, agents are authorised to use deadly force if they believe they are at risk of death, imminent threat of death or grievous bodily harm, Gray said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A specific clause states that officers cannot fire at a moving vehicle unless someone in the car is threatening the officer or unless the vehicle is \"operated in a manner that threatens to cause death or serious physical injury\" and \"no other objectively reasonable means of defence appear to exist, which includes moving out of the path of the vehicle\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under the policy, officers are allowed to shoot at a threatening person inside the vehicle, but they cannot try to stop the car by shooting it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gray said Good may not have been purposely trying to run over the agent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But from the point of view of the officer or agent, all he knows is that this car is about to hit him,\" he said. \"If I were placed in the same situation, I think I would have shot.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials conducting the review will also consider that, just months earlier, Ross was dragged by a car and injured after confronting someone else in a vehicle. The incident could have convinced him Good was a similar threat, law enforcement experts said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">D'Amico said that even if officials determine Ross's first shot at Good was justified, it might be harder to justify the second and third rounds Ross appeared to fire after the vehicle pulled away from him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that it would have been easy to find justification to use deadly force during arrests made during his own career, such as when a suspect reached for an unspecified object. But that did not mean such force was always the best course of action.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think they're going to find that (the shooting) was justified,\" said D'Amico. \"But just because you can take the shot doesn't mean you should.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Reconstructing the scene</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In their review process, federal agents will also examine evidence beyond the videos, including reconstructing the scene physically and digitally, said Christopher Piehota, former head of the FBI Science and Technology Programs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witness accounts, background information about Ross and Good and details about what else was going on that morning will help them examine what Piehota called the \"totality\" of the circumstances.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Minnesota officials have said the federal government has blocked them from participating in the investigation. And Governor Tim Walz has expressed concerns that a probe conducted only by federal officials could be biased. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Local officials have said they will conduct their own review.

data centres and cryptocurrencies saw US emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years, a new analysis shows.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year homes burned more gas for heating while the use of coal surged by 13% to meet rising electricity demands, the data finds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although solar power also shot up last year, overall, greenhouse gas emissions went up by 2.4% after two years of decreases, outpacing the level of economic growth, according to estimates from the Rhodium Group.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authors say the policies of the Trump administration didn't \"meaningfully impact\" the rise in emissions but they expect this to change in the coming years.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the colder parts of the United States, most homes rely on natural gas and other fossil fuels for their heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The low temperatures experienced in early 2025 saw consumption of these fuels increase by nearly 7% compared with the previous year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Extra electric power was also needed by the boom in data centres and cryptocurrency mining operations in places like Texas and the Ohio Valley region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rising demand for power combined with the higher cost of gas was behind the 13% surge in US coal use last year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That was in marked contrast to both India and China, where coal use for electricity dropped 3% and 1.6% respectively as both countries added record amounts of wind and solar energy, according to an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-coal-power-drops-in-china-and-india-for-first-time-in-52-years-after-clean-energy-records/?utm_source=cbnewsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=2026-01-13&amp;utm_campaign=Daily+Briefing+Venezuelan+oil+and+1+5C+Historic+coal+drop+in+India-China+UK+net-zero+row\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">analysis</a> for the website, Carbon Brief.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The grid decided to meet that additional load this year, in part with renewables, in part with fossil but because of higher natural gas prices, there was some fuel switching that saw marginally more coal than there was in 2024,\" said Michael Gaffney, from Rhodium Group, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://rhg.com/research/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2025/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the report</a>'s lead author. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other observers see the high price of gas in the US as closely related to continuing large exports of gas to the rest of the world.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Higher natural gas prices means that finally, coal, which had been kind of driven to extinction by low natural gas prices, well [gas is] now so expensive that coal's worthwhile again,\" said Jesse Lee, from Climate Power, a US-based environmental campaign group. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And that's what is allowing coal to make this comeback.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 2007 coal power generation in the US has shrunk by 64%, with last year's rise only the second in the last decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year also saw a slowdown in the rate of coal plant retirements, as electricity companies delayed closures to meet demands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So is 2025 the start of the revival of coal?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's more than just a blip,\" said Michael Gaffney.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a response to the demand growth in the sector, a lot of it is coming from data centres, cryptocurrency operations, other large load customers, and that demand growth is here to stay.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Solar power also experienced a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%, the fastest rate since 2017.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Transport in the US, by road, rail and air remains the largest source of warming gases, with road traffic volumes increasing for the fifth year in a row.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, emissions from this sector were virtually flat in 2025 due to increasing numbers of hybrid and electric vehicles on the roads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hybrids, in particular, showed strong growth, up 25% compared to 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While President Trump has been forceful in his determination to rollback the climate-related policies of his predecessor, and to boost US extraction of fossil fuel, Rhodium analysts who carried out this report say those changes made little difference in 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some others disagree.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is a data centre explosion, that is somewhat independent of Trump,\" says Lee, of Climate Power. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You could argue maybe his policies haven't all kicked in full blast yet, but I don't think you can really divorce his natural gas exports and his blind support of AI and data centres from this dynamic that's driving up emissions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0

Iranian anger and frustration have exploded into the streets before, but the latest explosion comes on top of all the military blows inflicted on Iran in the last two years by the US and Israel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But more significant for hard-pressed Iranians struggling to feed their families has been the impact of sanctions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the latest blow for the Iranian economy, all the UN sanctions lifted under the now dead 2015 nuclear deal were reimposed by the UK, Germany and France in September. In 2025 food price inflation was more than 70%. The currency, the rial, reached a record low in December.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the Iranian regime is under huge pressure, the evidence is that it's not about to die. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crucially, the security forces remain loyal. Since the Islamic revolution in 1979 the Iranian authorities have spent time and money creating an elaborate and ruthless network of coercion and repression.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the last two weeks, the regime's forces obeyed orders to shoot their fellow citizens in the streets. The result is that the demonstrations of the last few weeks have ended - as far as we can tell in a country whose rulers continue to impose a communications black out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the forefront of the suppression of protest is the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), the most important single organisation in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has the specific task of defending the ideology and system of government of the Islamic revolution of 1979, answering directly to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The IRGC is estimated to have something like 150,000 men under arms, operating as a parallel force to Iran's conventional armed military. It is also a major player in the Iranian economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A potent mix of power, money, corruption and ideology means it has every reason to defend the system.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48e3/live/657dc850-f099-11f0-b841-f5ca2eea5c88.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"West Asia News Agency via Reuters A street scene at night showing protesters gathering around parked cars. Smoke can be seen and there are some fires near the crowd.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">West Asia News Agency via Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Iran's judiciary chief has vowed \"swift and harsh\" punishment for \"rioters\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The IRGC has an auxiliary force, the Basij militia, a volunteer paramilitary organisation. It claims to have millions of members. Some western estimates put its active duty contingent in the hundreds of thousands, still a very substantial total. The Basij are at the sharp end of the regime's crackdowns against protesters.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I saw the IRGC and the Basij in action in Tehran in 2009, as they moved to suppress huge demonstrations that followed a disputed presidential election. Basij volunteers lined the streets armed with rubber truncheons and wooden clubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Behind them were uniformed men with automatic weapons. Motorcycle squads roared around Tehran's broad avenues, descending on groups trying to protest. In less than two weeks, protests that had choked the streets were reduced to small groups of students chanting slogans and setting fire to rubbish skips. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At dusk, people went to their balconies and rooftops to chant God is greatest, as their parents had against the Shah, until that petered out too.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The seeming resilience of the internal security forces does not mean that the supreme leader or his lieutenants can or will relax. US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action. The millions of Iranians who want the fall of the regime must be seething with resentment and anger.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran, the government and the supreme leader appear to be looking for ways to release some of the pressure they are facing. Bellicose official rhetoric is mixed with an offer to resume negotiations with the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to see how the two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks. But negotiations could buy time for Iran, especially if Trump can be convinced that a deal, however unlikely, is possible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As part of his pressure campaign, Trump says that he will slap a 25% tariff on the goods of any country that does business with Iran. Again, it is hard to see how that might work. China buys most of Iran's oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and China's President Xi Jinping agreed a truce in their trade war last autumn, with a summit due to be held in Beijing in April. The summit will deal with the biggest issues facing the world's two superpowers. Would Trump want to jeopardise or disrupt the summit simply to keep up pressure on Iran?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Tehran the biggest priority for the ageing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei is to preserve the Islamic Republic's system of rule. More eruptions of protest can expect a severe response. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An advantage for the regime is lack of coherent leadership among protesters. The eldest son of the Shah deposed by the revolution almost half a century ago has been trying to be the leader they lack. His appeal seems to be limited by his family's history and his close links with Israel.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One lesson that might worry the clerics and military men in Tehran comes from their erstwhile ally, former President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. He seemed to have won his war, and was being slowly rehabilitated by Saudi Arabia and the Arab League when he was faced at the end of 2024 with a well organised rebel offensive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Russia and Iran, his two most important allies were neither willing or perhaps able to save him. Within days, Assad and his family were flying into exile in Moscow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An authoritarian regime decays gradually, then suddenly. When Assad's Syria collapsed, it went very fast. Another example that might be studied in Tehran is the downfall in 2011 of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, when the army moved to protect protesters from the internal security forces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall of Ben Ali precipitated the resignation of Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. He might have survived huge demonstrations had not the armed forces decided that to save their own position he had to go. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Could that happen in Iran? Perhaps. Not yet. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Opponents of the Islamic regime will hope for more pressure at home and abroad and the emergence of credible leadership, so that the process of decay will speed up, accelerating from gradual, to sudden.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trade will be on the agenda, along with agriculture and international security, Carney's office said. Beijing's foreign ministry said the two countries have \"shared interests\" and should work to \"increase people-to-people ties and cultural exchanges\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday, Carney meets the Premier of China, Li Qiang, as well as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Zhao Leji.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, the prime minister is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping one-on-one, after the pair met last year on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This official visit is a significant step in the rapprochement after Canada-China relations hit a low in 2018, following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a US warrant on fraud charges related to Iran sanctions violations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The detention in Canada of the executive of a Chinese telecom giant angered Beijing, and China subsequently arrested two Canadians on espionage charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All three were released in 2021 after Meng cut a deal with US prosecutors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More recently, China has been accused of meddling in Canada's politics, though a public inquiry on foreign interference found its impact in recent federal elections to be minimal. China has repeatedly denied allegations of foreign meddling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada and China have struggled to forge meaningful ties in the past. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.international.gc.ca/transparency-transparence/indo-pacific-indo-pacifique/index.aspx?lang=eng#a2_1_1\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Ottawa views China as \"an increasingly disruptive global power\" </a> that \"increasingly disregards\" international rules and norms, though it recognises China's size and influence make some cooperation necessary. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Carney government does not see this upcoming visit as a deviation from that view, senior Canadian government officials told reporters this week. But they added that Canada cannot achieve its objective of reducing economic reliance on the US without increasing trade with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Carney is said to be approaching talks with an eye on increasing collaboration in areas of mutual interest like energy and climate, and putting guardrails on areas where the two countries clash, like defence and critical minerals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think we are approaching the relationship now with the realism that we haven't seen for decades,\" Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat, told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson added that it could result in a \"healthier relationship if both sides understand where they're coming from and what the red lines are\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has already proven to be a careful line to walk. Ahead of Carney's visit, two Liberal MPs cut a sponsored trip to Taiwan short, telling <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/politics/article-liberal-mps-trip-taiwan-carney-china/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the Globe and Mail newspaper </a>that while Canada's position on Taiwan \"has not changed\", the trip ended early to \"avoid confusion with its foreign policy, given the overlap with the Prime Minister's engagement in Beijing\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of Canada's main objectives during this trip is to ease Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola that have hurt farmers in the country's prairie provinces. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">China last year imposed the agriculture tariffs in a move widely seen as retaliation for Canadian levies on Chinese electric vehicles announced in 2024, mirroring similar levies by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an editorial this week, state-run newspaper Global Times pointed to frustration expressed by Canadian farmers, suggesting \"perhaps this was the heavy price (Canada) paid for blindly following the US\". China has made it clear it wants the tariffs on EVs lifted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For China, Canada is seen as an important trading partner, with trade between the two countries valued at around $118bn in 2024. But crucially for Beijing, if President Xi manages to make a deal with Carney, it would give China more influence in a country that is on America's doorstep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Global Times op-ed called on Ottawa to set a foreign policy path separate from that of the US and to exercise \"strategic autonomy\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One big unknown about this visit is how the US would react to any deals struck between Canada and China. Canada's economy has been hit by US tariffs, especially those on its steel, aluminium and automotive sectors. Talks to ease those levies remain on pause.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Canada will soon, however, be engaged in consequential talks on renewing a long-standing North American free trade agreement with the US and Mexico that has shielded it from the bulk of Trump's sweeping tariffs. That review is set to be completed later this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Robertson, the former diplomat, said it is likely that the Americans are watching the Canada-China relationship \"very closely\", and that Canada is keeping the US \"well informed\" of its intentions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"At the end of the day, there's Canadian interests that we're pursuing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"with-additional-reporting-from-jessica-murphy-in-toronto.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">With additional reporting from Jessica Murphy in Toronto. </i></p></div></div></body></html>"

According to Indian law, she should have been produced before a Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) - a three-member bench that deals with matters concerning children in conflict with the law - within 24 hours of her arrest. But this was not done, Yamina Rizvi, a lawyer who took over Pooja's case in 2024, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs, which comprise of a principal magistrate and two social workers, decide if a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult in case of heinous crimes - a provision <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35161193\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">introduced</a> in India's Juvenile Justice law after the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20765320\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">2012 Delhi gang rape case</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But instead of appearing before a JJB, Pooja was lodged in a prison for six years while her case was heard in an adult court.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"JJBs are also required to make regular visits to prisons to check if minors have been lodged there. But not a single check was conducted while Pooja was in prison,\" Rizvi alleges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2024, Pooja's case was finally transferred to a JJB, which found that she was indeed a minor at the time of the alleged crime. She was released on time served as the maximum sentence for a juvenile is three years and Pooja had already spent six years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Pooja is one of thousands of children who have been let down by the juvenile justice system,\" Rizvi says.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been nearly four decades since India passed its first comprehensive legislation to deal with children in conflict with the law - the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act. It has been amended several times since then to strengthen its provisions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The law aims to protect children and create opportunities for reform so that they can reintegrate into society and live meaningful lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts who work with children say that there is a long way to go before the system can properly implement the ideals the law preaches.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strength of India's juvenile justice system depends heavily on the health of its JJBs - quasi-judicial panels tasked with ensuring that a child's rights are protected even as they face the legal consequences of their actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs, established in 2000, don't function in isolation but are the fulcrum of a network comprising child-friendly services including sensitised police units, legal aid services and rehabilitation centres.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But research shows that all is not well with these pivotal panels. For one, getting information about them is difficult as there is no single government portal that tracks and publicly shares data related to them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Data shared in November by the India Justice Report (IJR) - a report created by civil society organisations to track the effectiveness of India's justice system - shows that as of 2023, more than half the cases before 362 JJBs were pending hearing. The report doesn't cover all of India's JJBs as it is based on answers from states that responded to a set of questions sent by IJR through the Right to Information Act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the report, India's  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://indiajusticereport.org/files/IJR_JJ%202025_Main%20Report_.pdf\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">745 districts have 707 JJBs</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The report also found that one in four JJBs lacked a full bench, even though the law mandates that every district should have at least one fully-staffed JJB.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2236/live/9ca2dff0-f05d-11f0-963f-9521d78d3d01.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Protesters hold posters and placards demanding the death sentence for the convicts in the Delhi gang rape case on September 13, 2013 in New Delhi, India.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Massive protests sparked by the 2012 Delhi gang rape led to a change in India's juvenile justice law</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maja Daruwala, editor at IJR, says that the dearth of accurate data indicates poor oversight and creates a lack of accountability, which in turn seriously impacts the quality of care and rehabilitation opportunities juveniles receive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fr Antony Sebastian, founder of Echo, an NGO working for the welfare of juveniles, says that in the absence of JJBs, children lose not just the protection guaranteed to them by law, but also the chance to reform.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"These children largely come from poor backgrounds and dysfunctional families, and they grow up witnessing violence and scarcity. When the police beat them and dump them in jails, they're revictimised all over again,\" says Fr Sebastian, a former principal magistrate on two separate JJBs in Bengaluru city. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For minors not sent to jail, there isn't much scope for reformation in child care institutions (facilities that house children in conflict with the law), says Deeksha Gujral, programme director at iProbono, which offers legal aid to vulnerable people. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs can send children accused of crimes to observation homes, while those found to have committed an offence are placed in special homes. A separate facility, called a 'place of safety', houses children aged 16-18 years who are accused or found guilty of committing heinous offences.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">JJBs are mandated to inspect these facilities every month to ensure they meet the standards prescribed by law. However, many children's rights advocates say that regular checks seldom happen and even if they do, they're conducted in a superficial manner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gujral, who has visited several observation and special homes in the course of her work, says that many of them are overcrowded, and lack counsellors or meaningful recreational, educational and vocational facilities. Additionally, while there are separate facilities for boys and girls, the mandated age-based segregation within these facilities is not always adhered to.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b6c1/live/7cf9a100-ed26-11f0-bd16-1f0cdc962a12.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Echo/Fr Antony Sebastian A photo of an expansive building that is the Echo special home in Bengaluru city.

On 28 December, traders selling imported electronic goods in Tehran were jolted by the sudden currency collapse; they shuttered their shops, went on strike, and urged others in the bazaar to follow suit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government's initial response was quick and conciliatory. President Masoud Pezeshkian promised dialogue and acknowledged \"legitimate demands\" in a country where inflation soars near 50%, and currency depreciations play havoc with people's hardscrabble lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A new monthly allowance, amounting to about $7 (£5), was soon deposited in everyone's bank account to help ease the pain.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prices shot up further; the wave of unrest swelled.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Less than three weeks later, Iranians were marching everywhere - from small deprived provincial towns to major cities, chanting for economic and political change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are no quick and simple fixes now; it's the system.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran is broken by years of crippling international sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, deep seated rage over restrictions on social freedoms, and agony over the cost of this prolonged standoff with the West.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But, so far, the centre appears to be holding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The most important element still missing from a full collapse is repressive forces deciding that they no longer benefit from, and are no longer willing to kill for, the regime,\" explains Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before this crisis erupted, the most powerful players in Iran's ruling circles were known to be bitterly divided on key issues: if and how to resume the ill-fated negotiations with the US over a new nuclear deal, as well as how to restore strategic deterrence after the blows to its military proxies and political partners during the Gaza war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But survival of the system, their system, matters above all else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ultimate authority still rests with the ailing 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, but he's encircled by his most loyal defenders, among them the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), who now hold sway over the economy, politics and security of the Islamic Republic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Trump's almost daily threats are known to have concentrated minds at the top. It has also provoked speculation far and wide over the impact of any outside intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Military action could bolster the protesters; it could also backfire.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The primary impact would be to shore up elite unity and suppress fractures within the regime at a moment of heightened vulnerability,\" says Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa programme at the London-based think tank Chatham House.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3127/live/953db190-efdb-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, poses after an interview with Reuters about the situation in Iran and the need to support Iranians, in Paris, France, June 23, 2025\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's former shah, is among those calling on the US to intervene</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of the loudest Iranian voices calling on President Trump to intervene has been the exiled former crown prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown as Iran's shah in the 1979 Islamic revolution. But his call, and his close ties to Israel, are controversial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Other voices, from Nobel peace laureate Narges Mohammadi - still imprisoned in Iran, to award-winning filmmaker Jafar Panahi, insist that change must be peaceful,  and must come from within.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this current unrest, Pahlavi has shown his capacity to help galvanise and give shape to this uprising. His appeals at the start of last week for coordinated chanting appear to have drawn more people out into the bitter winter cold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's impossible to know the depth of his support, and whether this profound yearning for change leads some to hold fast to a familiar symbol. Iran's pre-revolutionary flag, with its lion and sun, has been unfurled again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pahlavi emphasises he's not trying to bring back the monarchy but to lead a democratic transition; but in the past he has not been a unifying figure in the divided Iranian diaspora.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fears of collapse and chaos, financial woes, and more, also weigh on the minds of Iranians including those who still back the ruling clerics. Reform not revolution is on some minds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">History tells us that when fervour and force meet on the streets, change can come from above, or below. It is always unpredictable - and often perilous.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Hamas fighters used paragliders to cross the high-tech security fence into Israel at the start of the attack, landing in civilian areas where many residents died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 1,200 people were killed in the attack. It triggered a massive Israeli military offensive on Gaza, which has killed more than 71,419 people since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdel-Fattah confirmed to Australian broadcaster ABC that she had posted the image, but said she had done so before the true extent of the attacks was known.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"At that point, I had no idea about the death toll, I had no idea about what was happening on the ground...

Upon news of the growing walkout, he added: \"I think for everyone who has dropped out that it's rather pathetic because that means they agree with what Dr Fattah is on about... Namely, that Israel should not exist.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskus - whose government is a key backer of the festival - said that he \"wholeheartedly\" supported Abdel-Fattah's exclusion and had \"absolutely made clear to the board that I did not think it was wise\" to invite her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Malinauskus denied having played any role in the board's decision, telling the ABC on Monday that, though he shared his opinion, he had not threatened to withdraw funding or sack anyone. He also denied that his position was influenced by Jewish lobby groups.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adler said the board's decision had been taken \"despite my strongest opposition\" and added: \"In my view, boards composed of individuals with little experience in the arts, and blind to the moral implications of abandoning the principle of freedom of expression, have been unnerved by the pressure exerted by politicians calculating their electoral prospects and relentless, coordinated letter-writing campaigns.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The board's statement cites community cohesion, an oft-referenced anxiety which should be treated with scepticism,\" she said. \"One doesn't have to be a student of history to know that art in the service of 'social cohesion' is propaganda.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After her appearance was cancelled, Abdel-Fattah said Australian arts and cultural institutions had displayed \"utter contempt and inhumanity towards Palestinians\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The only Palestinians they will tolerate are silent and invisible ones.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It isn't the first time Abdel-Fattah has been at the centre of the derailment of a writers' festival.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two days before it was due to begin in August last year, Bendigo Writers Festival issued a code of conduct requiring speakers to \"avoid language or topics that could be considered inflammatory, divisive, or disrespectful\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A subsequent walkout - led by Abdel-Fattah and others over concerns it could prevent free discussion of the Israel-Gaza war - led to the cancellation of around a third of the programme.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Allegations of hypocrisy</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However Abdel-Fattah has been accused of double standards, by sections of the media and Malinauskus, who claim that she had successfully demanded the exclusion of New York Times journalist Thomas Friedman from the  Adelaide festival two years ago.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A letter sent by her and nine other academics to the board followed his publication of a column in which he compared players in the Middle East to members of the animal kingdom, including caterpillars, wasps and spiders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Call it what you like, after the correspondence from Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah, they removed a pro-Jewish Israeli speaker. Fast forward two years and I think it's reasonable for the board to apply the same principle,\" Malinauskus said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdel-Fattah rejected the allegations of hypocrisy, saying in a statement to the BBC that Friedman's article had \"compared various Arab and Muslim nations and groups to insects and vermin requiring eradication at a time when talk of 'human animals' was being used to justify wholesale slaughter in Gaza\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In contrast, I was cancelled because my presence and identity as a Palestinian was deemed 'culturally insensitive' and linked to the Bondi atrocity,\" her statement continued.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She also denied that Friedman had been removed at her behest. In a letter dated February 2024 and quoted by Australian media, the board wrote that cancelling a writer was an \"extremely serious request\" and that while Friedman had been scheduled to attend he would no longer take part due to \"last-minute scheduling issues\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If he was in fact quietly cancelled, it only underscores the racism of cancelling me in such a brazen and publicly humiliating manner,\" Abdel-Fattah said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has contacted Friedman for comment.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What have other writers said?</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/29e7/live/9cee1630-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Jacinda Ardern wearing a linen blazer\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jacinda Ardern did not make a statement but confirmed her withdrawal on Monday</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Adler said at least 180 writers had withdrawn from the festival, devastating its programme. Some said that while they did not necessarily agree with Abdel-Fattah, they defended her right to free speech.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Australian journalist Peter Greste, who was jailed in Egypt a decade ago in what human rights groups called a sham case, in an opinion piece for the Guardian Australia wrote that her exclusion meant \"we are undermining our capacity to hold those difficult conversations\" and \"doing the work\" of extremists for them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kathy Lette in an Instagram post argued that audiences should be trusted to \"make up their minds about all speakers – me included.

He told the Guardian Australia he believed some of her previous statements had been counterproductive to the Palestinian cause and that given the circumstances after the Bondi attack the decision was not unreasonable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Adelaide writers' festival has supported hearing Palestinian voices, its record on this is unimpeachable,\" Carr said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was one of the only festival speakers to publicly back the board.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b1b4/live/e851b550-f00f-11f0-bc34-d1ffe99377e2.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Former Foreign Minister Bob Carr speaks at a press conference\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Former Foreign Minister Bob Carr has been a regular critic of Israel</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Former Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis posted a video on X in which he tore up his \"precious\" and \"coveted\" invitation to speak, claiming the festival had been \"destroyed\" by the \"Zionist lobby\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Award-winning First Nations poet Dr Evelyn Araluen said she was \"so disappointed to witness yet another absurd and irrational capitulation to the demands of a genocidal foreign state from the Australian arts sector\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Erasing Palestinians from public life in Australia won't prevent antisemitism,\" she added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">ABC journalist and presenter Sarah Ferguson, who had been due to host conversations with Tina Brown and Jacinda Ardern – both now cancelled – said the festival had \"created a place where debate flourished… including on our most difficult subjects\" and that it \"should be defended in our cultural life\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What happens next?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In its latest statement, the board said: \"This is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia's worst terror attack in history.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The focus would now turn to re-assembling the board, the statement said, and \"ensuring a successful Adelaide Festival... which safeguards the long and rich cultural legacy of our state.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it is \"committed to rebuilding trust with our artistic community\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Abdel-Fattah has rejected the board's apology as \"disingenuous\". \"It is clear that the board's regret extends to how the message of my cancellation was conveyed, not the decision itself,\" she wrote in a post on Instagram.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Bondi shooting does not mean I or anyone else has to stop advocating for an end to the illegal occupation and systematic extermination of my people -
