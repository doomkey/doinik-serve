The day before, Ukraine's security services had carried out searches and arrests targeting alleged Russian spies at the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The passing of the legislation instantly sparked the largest protests since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 in several cities across Ukraine, with many worrying the law would severely undermine the Nabu and Sap's authority and effectiveness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9w19vxjr44o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Thousands of people gathered in streets and squares across Ukraine</a>, holding placards calling for the legislation to be vetoed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Several commentators accused Zelensky of democratic backsliding. Their concerns were further exacerbated when Ukraine's Western partners signalled their displeasure with the bill. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukraine has official EU candidate status and a spokesman for European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen previously warned Kyiv that the rule of law and the fight against corruption were \"core elements\" of membership to the bloc. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Thursday, the Commission said it \"welcomed\" the Ukrainian government's decision to take action against the bill. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We are working [with the Ukrainian government] to make sure that our concerns... are indeed taken into account,\" the spokesman said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The creation of Nabu and Sap in 2014-15 was one of the requirements set by the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund to move towards a relaxation of visa restrictions between Ukraine and the EU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Opposition MP Oleksiy Goncharenko noted Zelensky's comments that \"the independence of anti-corruption institutions must be guaranteed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"First we take it away, and then we say that it must be guaranteed. So why was all this necessary?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his message on social media on Thursday, Zelensky did not acknowledge the protests or the backlash but said it was \"important that we respect the position of all Ukrainians and are grateful to everyone who stands with Ukraine.\"</p></div></div></body></html>"

She added that \"the Crown cannot meet its onus on any of the counts before me\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The central issue of the trial was whether EM, who was 20 at the time, had consented to every sexual act in the room that night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lawyers for the players contended that she asked the men to have sex with her and they believed she gave consent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Carter Hart were all  players with the National Hockey League (NHL) when the allegations surfaced, although one was playing in Europe. Only one, Mr Hart, testified in his own defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The trial attracted significant attention in Canada, and so many people attended court to hear the ruling on Thursday that clerks had to open two additional overflow rooms.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In explaining her ruling, Justice Carroccia pointed to inconsistencies in EM's testimony, including about who had bought drinks that night, and said EM's statements reflected an \"uncertain memory\" that did not line up with evidence presented in the trial. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There were differences in what the woman told police investigators and those for Hockey Canada, which settled a C$3.5m ($2.5m; £1.9m) lawsuit for an undisclosed sum in 2022, as well, the judge said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Two videos from the incident were shared in the trial, where EM was recorded giving her consent to the activities. The first was taken without her knowledge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While, under Canadian law, the videos did not establish consent, the judge said they did show EM \"speaking normally, smiling,\" and that she \"did not appear to be in distress.\" That undercut the Crown's argument that EM did not leave the room out of fear, she said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is unclear if the Crown will appeal the ruling, with prosecutor Meaghan Cunningham saying in a statement that they will carefully review the decision. She also said they had received \"dozens of messages from people across Canada and abroad\" expressing thanks and support for EM.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"A successful prosecution is not measured solely by whether there are guilty verdicts at the end,\" she said. \"The Crown's goal throughout this proceeding has been to see a fair trial, a trial that is fair to the men charged, and one that is also fair to EM.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout the trial, the Crown argued the woman's testimony was credible, that \"intoxication does not equal unreliability\" and that any inconsistencies in her testimony were minor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They also argued the woman did not have a motive to fabricate a story and that she had initially reported the alleged assault to police in 2018, four years before filing the lawsuit against Hockey Canada.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They added that text messages between the players allegedly showed it was Mr McLeod's idea to invite his teammates to the room and that the players allegedly engaged in \"getting their story straight\" by drafting a narrative that EM had consented to all sexual activity.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dFZIgd\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/af2d/live/c0703a90-68c2-11f0-89ea-4d6f9851f623.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Reuters Protesters in front of courthouse hold signs showing support for EM that read \"We believe her\", \"Justice for EM\" and \"My dress is not a yes\"' class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Reuters</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Defence lawyers, however, argued that EM's testimony was undermined by eyewitness evidence , in which other players who were in the hotel room that night but were not charged said she was \"vocal\" about what she wanted sexually.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">They said the evidence suggested the woman was a willing participant who later experienced regret, and added that intoxication in this case did not equal \"incapacity\", submitting video evidence suggesting EM had not shown signs of extreme intoxication.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Cambodia banned imports from Thailand such as fruits and vegetables, and stopped importing power and internet services.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Both countries have also strengthened troop presence along the border in recent weeks.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">What exactly happened on Thursday?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand and Cambodia have given differing versions of what happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand's National Security Council (NSC) claims that just after 07:30 local time (00:30GMT) on Thursday, Cambodia's military deployed drones to conduct surveillance of Thai troops near the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shortly afterwards, Cambodian military personnel carrying rocket-propelled grenades gathered near the border. Soldiers on the Thai side attempted negotiations by shouting, but were unsuccessful, the NSC spokesman said, adding that Cambodian soldiers opened fire at around 08:20, forcing the Thai side to retaliate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand has accused Cambodia of deploying heavy weapons, including BM-21 rocket launchers and artillery, causing damage to homes and public facilities including a hospital and a petrol station along the Thai side of the border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Cambodia claims that Thai soldiers initiated the conflict at around 06:30, when they violated a prior agreement by advancing on a Khmer-Hindu temple near the border and placing barbed wire around its base.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thai soldiers then deployed a drone just after 07:00, and fired shots \"into the air\" at around 08:30, according to Maly Socheata, a spokesperson from Cambodia's Ministry of National Defence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At 08:46, Thai soldiers \"pre-emptively\" opened fire on Cambodian troops, leaving them no choice but to exercise their right to self-defence, according to the Phnom Penh Post newspaper quoting Socheata.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Socheata further accused Thailand of deploying excessive troops, using heavy weapons and carrying out air strikes on Cambodian territory.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Will this escalate into a full war?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Thailand's acting premier Phumtham Wechayachai said that its dispute with Cambodia remains \"delicate\" and must be addressed with care, and in line with international law.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said his country wants to resolve the dispute peacefully and that it has \"no choice\" but to \"respond with armed force against armed aggression\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While there have been serious exchanges of fire in the past, they de-escalated relatively quickly -  a path our correspondent Jonathan Head thinks will be followed again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, he warns, there's a lack of leadership with the strength and confidence to pull back from this confrontation in both countries at the moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">You can read more of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c98j77zde86t?post=asset%3A42bba343-787f-4138-a30c-63e004b4cc3f#post\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">his analysis here</a>.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Is it safe to travel to Thailand and Cambodia?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The fighting as it stands is very localised, and as yet the British Foreign Office has not issued a specific travel advisory at the time of writing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, it had already urged travellers to take \"extra care\" in the area following the closure of the border crossings in recent weeks - \"especially at tourist destinations such as the Preah Vihear temple, the Ta Kwai temple and the Ta Muen Thom temple\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">You can check the latest travel advice on the FCDO site</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile China has urged its citizens in Cambodia to avoid the Thai border.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The students have denied any involvement in his disappearance. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For years, India's crime-fighting agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has been trying to figure what may have happened to Mr Ahmed - the agency took over the case from city police in 2017. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now a court in Delhi has finally shut the investigation after the CBI said it had exhuasted all possible leads in the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"As a parting note, the court earnestly hopes that Najeeb Ahmed shall be traced soon,\" the court said in the order, which was announced last month. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Ahmed's family, however, have alleged the inquiry was not conducted in a proper manner and said they would appeal the decision in a higher court. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"What message does it send, that India's premier investigating agency has not been able to find a missing student from one of India's best universities?\" Mr Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees told BBC Hindi. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We will not give up until we find our son.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Born in a village in Uttar Pradesh, Mr Ahmed, the son of a carpenter, was the eldest of four.

JNU is known for its vibrant and intense student politics, with ideological groups often clashing over campus issues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In his testimonies to the CBI, his roommate Mohd Qasim said that Mr Ahmed got injured in the altercation and had to be taken to a public hospital, where he was allegedly refused treatment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The doctors told him they could not treat his wounds without a formal crime complaint having been made to the police, his roommate alleged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">According to the court order, Mr Ahmed chose not to file a complaint and returned to campus. He went missing the next day, leaving behind his phone, wallet, and clothes in his hostel room.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A CBI report says Mr Ahmed last used his phone and laptop around 10am the day he disappeared. A hostel warden told the agency that he saw Mr Ahmed getting into a tuk-tuk in the morning and leaving campus. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees, who had been informed of the scuffle over phone by Mr Ahmed's roommate, was on her way to Delhi to see her son. She arrived in the morning and upon finding him missing, filed a missing persons complaint on 15 October 2016. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For days, there was no progress. Protests erupted on campus as students and activists accused authorities of inaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In November 2016, Ms Nafees filed a petition in the Delhi High Court, accusing the police of being \"slow, misdirected and subjective\" and called for a court-monitored probe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A month later, Delhi Police conducted two extensive searches using sniffer dogs across JNU's sprawling campus - but again, nothing was found. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In May 2017, the court handed over the investigation to the CBI. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A year later, the CBI told the court it had exhausted all possible leads - and asked the bench to close the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had examined more than 500 witnesses, collected information from taxi, bus, train and flight operators, and searched hospitals and morgues, but had found nothing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A one million rupees [$11,600; £8,600] <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://cbi.gov.in/press-detail/MjU0Mg==#:~:text=CBI%20ANNOUNCES%20A%20REWARD%20OF,STUDENT%20OF%20JAWAHARLAL%20NEHRU%20UNIVERSITY\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reward for information</a> about Mr Ahmed also failed to yield results, investigators argued. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The case dragged on for two more years, when in 2020, Ms Nafees returned to court, this time to challenge the CBI's conclusions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">She alleged the agency failed to properly probe the students involved in the scuffle with her son. She said they had a \"clear motive\", had threatened him, and should have been arrested. The CBI denied all allegations saying they had left \"no stone unturned\" in looking for Mr Ahmed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The agency said it had tracked the phone locations of the nine students involved in the fight with Mr Ahmed that night, but found no evidence linking them to his disappearance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250711-084946-a521911844-web-2.25.0-9/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/96cc/live/bad236d0-65ff-11f0-a91e-6325aab01240.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Hindustan Times via Getty Images) JNU students with people from different organisations, during a protest march and dharna against Delhi Police over missing JNU student Najeeb Ahmed at Jantar Mantar, on December 14, 2016 in New Delhi, India.\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Hindustan Times via Getty Images)</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Najeeb Ahmed's disappearance sparked massive protests in Delhi in 2016</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Explaining its decision to finally shut the case, a court in Delhi said that the CBI has investigated \"all plausible avenues\" thoroughly but \"no credible information\" could be received about Mr Ahmed's whereabouts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The judge dismissed Ms Nafees' plea, noting that while witnesses confirmed verbal threats, there was no \"direct or circumstantial\" evidence linking Mr Ahmed's disappearance to the fight with ABVP members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Such scuffles and exchanges are not unheard of\" in the charged atmosphere of JNU, the order added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The court, however, added that the CBI could reopen the case if new information comes to light.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The order has been a huge blow for Mr Ahmed's family and well-wishers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Colin Gonsalves, who represented Ms Nafees in the Delhi High Court in 2018, said he still questioned the investigation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The police routinely arrest people for minor crimes in India.  It's shocking then, that none of the students were taken into custody for questioning,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees alleges that her son's religion had affected the seriousness of the investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"If the victim had been a Hindu boy, would the police have responded the same way?\" she asked. <b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They would have demolished the houses of those suspected,\" she alleged, referring to the rising instances where homes of individuals accused of crimes are bulldozed by Indian authorities. The BBC has reached out to the CBI for comment. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the agency has consistently maintained that they have carried out the probe impartially. In 2018, the Delhi High Court had said that they had found no evidence that CBI investigated the case unfairly or \"under political compulsions\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Nafees says she's not done fighting.
