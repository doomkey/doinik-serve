They will be joined by President Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Witkoff has spoken with Zelensky, Macron, Ukrainian chief negotiator Rustem Umerov, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and is expected to relay the result of the discussions to Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week Putin said a draft peace plan had been shown by the Americans to Russia, and that it could become the \"basis\" for a future agreement to end the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cde6yld78d6o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">initial US-Russia draft peace plan circulated in November</a> sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billions' worth of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62np269qv9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">frozen Russian assets</a> currently held in European financial institutions should be invested and dictated the terms of Kyiv's access to EU markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Macron said there was currently \"no finalised peace plan to speak of\". He also insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders have been scrambled to get a seat at the negotiating table since the peace plan was leaked, and have urged the US to involve them in drafting any future agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Macron said that the territorial question could \"only be finalised by President Zelensky\" and pointed out that issues of frozen Russian assets, security guarantees, and accession to the EU needed to involve European nations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the French leader also praised efforts by Donald Trump's administration to end the conflict, which began in 2014 with Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea and was followed by its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now we are waiting the Russian answer: are they ready to stop fighting and make peace? I want to point out that for three, four times the Russians have said no,\" he added. \"So they don't seem in a rush.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Throughout the year Moscow has appeared to engage with US attempts to end the war or discuss a ceasefire, but several of its demands directly counter Ukraine's sovereignty and are seen as unacceptable by Kyiv. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While the question of territory is the major sticking point, the issue of security guarantees for Kyiv has also proved contentious.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv and its European partners are keen for Ukraine to be given security guarantees - such as Nato membership - that would protect it from being attacked again. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia vehemently opposes this and Donald Trump too has ruled out allowing Ukraine to join the military alliance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Away from the negotiating table, the war continues.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Monday morning a Russian missile attack on the eastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro killed four people and injured 40, authorities have said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unconfirmed reports say a ballistic missile was used in the strike.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Videos shared online showed a large explosion occur on the side of a motorway, and local media said an office block, cars and shops were hit or badly damaged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are trying to end this war with all our might and to end this war in a dignified manner,\" Zelensky said in Paris. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Russia must end this war that it started, it is its war and it is up to it to put an end to it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The latest diplomatic push comes as Zelensky is mired in a serious corruption scandal. His chief of staff Andriy Yermak, who had also led the Ukrainian delegation at peace talks, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0nljm4y74o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">resigned on Friday after anti-corruption investigators raided his home</a> - although he has not been accused of wrongdoing. Two cabinet ministers have also been fired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday Trump told reporters on Air Force One that Ukraine had \"some difficult little problems\", referring to the scandal, and repeated his view that both Russia and Ukraine wanted to end the war. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Trump has filed an appeal against that conviction. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before Habba took on the role of US Attorney for New Jersey, Trump had announced he was appointing her as his presidential counsellor during his second administration, describing Habba as \"unwavering in her loyalty\" and a \"tireless advocate for justice\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The appellate court's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that the prosecutor's appointment was unlawful, the BBC's US partner <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">CBS News</a><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/alina-habba-new-jersey-us-attorney-unlawfully-judge-rules/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> reported</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A federal judge ruled in their favour in August. That order had been on hold while the appeals court heard the case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Habba is not the first Trump-appointed US prosecutor to face a legal challenge. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A federal judge last week dismissed criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that the US attorney in the case, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney in Virginia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, a US district judge disqualified Bill Essayli from his role as acting US attorney for the Southern District of California, finding that he had stayed in the temporary post longer than the law allowed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the judge allowed Essayli to continue overseeing the office - the most populous US federal judicial district, serving around 19 million people - in his role as first assistant US attorney. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Defence attorneys have filed a motion to get that part of the judge's ruling reversed in an attempt to fully oust Essayli. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, another US district judge disqualified Nevada's lead federal prosecutor Sigal Chattah, finding that she, too, was not lawfully serving as acting US attorney. </p></div></div></body></html>"

In fact, he said, \"it was worse when trying to wash it off\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili wanted to find out if others had suffered similar effects. So he appealed, via social media, for those also targeted by crowd control measures during the first week of the demonstrations to fill out a survey. Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lasha Shergelashvili Lasha wearing army fatigues and a cap standing on an armoured vehicle and resting his arm on a mounted rifle \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Lasha Shergelashvili</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lasha Shergelashvili used to be in charge of weaponry for Georgia's riot police</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas.

He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our next step was to work out what these chemicals were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Shutterstock Hundreds of people demonstrating in the Georgian capital - massing on the street in the darkness with the parliament lit up to the side.

Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Camite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards. Ms Edwards has previously written to Georgia's government regarding allegations of police violence and torture during the protests.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The UN's Alice Edwards: \"Populations should never be subjected to experiments\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of strict regulation around the use of chemicals in water cannon is a problem she would like addressed: \"It does lead me to consider [this practice] as an experimental weapon. And populations should never be subjected to experiments. This is absolutely in violation of human rights law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She stressed that any effect of a riot control measure should be temporary under international law, and that the symptoms described \"are beyond what would be considered temporary and acceptable. So all of those cases should be investigated, including under the rubric of torture or other ill-treatment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia's authorities described our findings as \"deeply frivolous\" and \"absurd\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said that law enforcement had acted \"within the bounds of the law and constitution\" when responding to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue have dwindled in their size since the government increased fines and jail terms, but not in their frequency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208w378gg7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Almost every night for the past year</a>, demonstrators have called for the resignation of a government they accuse of rigging elections, siding with Russian interests, and passing increasingly draconian legislation against civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling Georgian Dream party denied the government or the party's honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, are either pro-Russian or pursuing Russian interests.

a sense that this would not be an entirely straightforward election but few would have foreseen the vote count being this close.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly before casting their ballots, voters at a farmers' market in Tegucigalpa spoke of their desire for change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People must vote based on reality in front of us, and not stay blindly

We heard his words, but we don't share his views.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In one social media post, Mr Trump also controversially promised to pardon the disgraced former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who is currently serving 45 years in a US prison for smuggling drugs and weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Remember, it wasn't even the Honduran justice system which tried and sentenced our ex-president for drug trafficking.

now climbed to more than 500, with rescue workers still battling to reach affected areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The floods, which were caused by a rare cyclone that had formed over the Malacca Strait, have hit three provinces and impacted some 1.4 million people, according to the government's disaster agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another 500 people remain missing, while thousands more have been injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Indonesia is just one part of Asia which has been hit with torrential rain and storms in recent days, with Thailand, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka all also reporting deaths.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Indonesia, the provinces of Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra have been hardest hit, with thousands still cut off and without critical supplies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Arini Amalia, a resident from Aceh's Pidie Jaya Regency, told the BBC the flood waters had been \"like a tsunami\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"According to my grandmother, this is the worst, the worst in her life,\" Amalia said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aid workers have been trying to reach people on foot and by motorcycle, as many roads are impassable to larger vehicles.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures from the region show bridges washed away, roads covered in mud and debris, and logs piled high.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At West Sumatra's Twin Bridges landmark, where flood waters swept through and deposited enormous amounts of mud and debris, Mariana watched as excavators cleared the roads, hoping they would find her missing family members including her 15-year-old son.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him?\" she said. \"Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><figure><div

In Sri Lanka, some 355 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Neither she nor SABC has commented on her arrest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her arrest, along with four others, follows the dramatic resignation from parliament last Friday of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, the daughter of South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma, who has been accused of duping the 17 South African men - including some of her relatives - into fighting for Russia, an allegation she denies. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) said that Mantula had been arrested with four men, aged between 21 and 46.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They each face a charge of contravening the Regulation of Foreign Military Assistance Act.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said the arrests followed a tip-off from police at South Africa's main international airport in Johannesburg.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They were \"intercepted\" as they attempted to travel to Russia via the United Arab Emirates, and \"were removed from the boarding gate after being deemed suspicious\", it added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said it was further alleged that Mantula \"had been facilitating the travel and recruitment of her co-accused into the Russian Federation military\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mantula and her co-accused appeared briefly at the Kempton Park Magistrates' Court near Johannesburg on Monday, and were remanded in custody.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The NPA said it was \"committed to ensuring that individuals who violate the laws of the country are held accountable and will continue to work with other law-enforcement partners to protect the integrity and security\" of South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accused are due to make their next court appearance on 8 December for a bail application. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In November, South Africa's government said it had received distress calls from 17 citizens who were trapped in Ukraine's war-torn Donbas region after joining mercenary forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It added that it was working through \"diplomatic channels\" to bring them back, but this has not yet happened. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The men were lured to join the mercenary forces under the pretext of lucrative contracts, the government said, adding that it condemned \"the exploitation of young vulnerable people by individuals working with foreign military entities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa has an unemployment rate of more than 30%, which is even higher among young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Sambudla's resignation as an MP came after her half-sister, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, filed a complaint with police, accusing her of tricking the 17 men to fight for Russia as mercenaries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Mncube said that eight of them were members of her family, and they had been \"handed to a Russian mercenary group to fight in the Ukraine war without their knowledge or consent\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa's elite police unit, the Hawks, said the case was being investigated by its officers who focus on \"crime against the state\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zuma-Sambudla, who became a member of parliament for the largest opposition party, uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), last year, has said in an affidavit that she thought the men were going to Russia for \"lawful\" training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">MK says it was her decision to resign as she wants to focus her efforts on ensuring the return of those trapped in a war zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, Kenyan police said they had rescued more than 20 people from a suspected trafficking ring that had lured them with job offers in Russia but intended to send them to fight in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has previously said that it was holding citizens of various countries - Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka - at prisoner-of-war camps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2022, Senegal's foreign ministry said it had summoned Kyiv's ambassador to demand the withdrawal of an embassy post on Facebook urging foreigners to enlist for its war effort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the time, Nigeria also warned that it would not tolerate Ukraine's recruitment drive, forcing it to back-pedal.</p></div></div></body></html>"

So this is trial by media, which is deeply unfair.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since Hasina's regime was overturned, prosecutors in Bangladesh have launched a number of wide-ranging legal cases against the former leader, her past associates and family members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The trial involving Siddiq - who <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk2e7x42zo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">quit as a Treasury minister in January over controversy</a> around her ties to her aunt - has been playing out in Dhaka since August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq continues to face a number of outstanding charges. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Court documents included claims that Siddiq \"forced and influenced her aunt and the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina using her special power to secure [a plot of land] for her mother Rehana Siddiq, sister Azmina Siddiq and brother Radwan Siddiq\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A prosecutor for Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) previously said Siddiq was tried as a Bangladeshi citizen as authorities had obtained her Bangladeshi passport, ID and tax number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq's lawyers have disputed she is a Bangladeshi citizen, telling the Financial Times she has \"never had\" an ID card or voter ID, and \"has not held a passport since she was a child\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620). If she fails to pay, six months will be added to the sentence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the trial began, the MP said prosecutors had \"peddled false and vexatious allegations that have been briefed to the media but never formally put to me by investigators\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A statement on her behalf continued: \"I have been clear from the outset that I have done nothing wrong and will respond to any credible evidence that is presented to me. Continuing to smear my name to score political points is both baseless and damaging.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A Labour spokesperson said the party could not recognise the judgement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As has been reported, highly regarded senior legal professionals have highlighted that Tulip Siddiq has not had access to a fair legal process in this case and has never been informed of the details of the charges against her,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is despite repeated requests made to the Bangladeshi authorities through her legal team. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Anyone facing any charge should always be afforded the right to make legal representations when allegations are made against them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is understood Siddiq is not subject to investigation or party disciplinary proceedings and retains her Labour Party membership and the Labour whip in the House of Commons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last week, a group of senior lawyers raised concerns with Bangladesh's representative in the UK over how the trial had been conducted. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Signatories to that statement included ex-Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, and Lady Cherie Blair, a human rights lawyer and wife of former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter first reported by <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/25/uk-lawyers-condemn-bangladesh-trial-london-labour-mp-tulip-siddiq\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the Guardian</a>, they said Siddiq had not been able to secure proper legal representation during the trial, adding: \"Such a process is artificial and a contrived and unfair way of pursuing a prosecution.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The verdict comes <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial</a> over her role in a brutal crackdown against the protests which ultimately forced her from office in July 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was found guilty of crimes against humanity over the deaths of an estimated 1,400 people at the hands of the police. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That trial was held in Hasina's absence, as she has been in exile in India since being ousted. She denied the charges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq, whose mother is the former prime minister's sister, continues to face a number of outstanding charges in Bangladesh, including two ongoing trials in relation to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq and her family have also been investigated in relation to allegations of embezzlement around a £3.9bn deal in 2013 connected to a Russian-funded nuclear power plant deal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq has repeatedly denied wrongdoing in relation to the allegations, which originated with claims made by Bobby Hajjaj, a political opponent of Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bangladeshi authorities have said they estimate that around $234bn (£174bn) was appropriated through corruption during Hasina's reign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Responding to the latest verdict, the Awami League, the political party which Hasina leads, described it as \"entirely predictable\" and \"firmly denied\" the allegations against the former prime minister and her family members.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The process fails to pass any reasonable test of judicial fairness - a point that has been made forcefully by both local and international legal experts,\" the party said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina also accused Bangladesh's judiciary of being controlled by an \"unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents\", namely the interim government headed up by Dr Muhammad Yunus.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prior to Siddiq's resignation from the British government, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's independent ethics adviser Sir Laurie Magnus said he had not found \"evidence of improprieties\" following an investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he said it was \"regrettable\" Siddiq had not been more alert to the \"potential reputational risks\" of her ties to Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While Siddiq continued to insist she was not guilty of any wrongdoing, she quit her junior ministerial role in order not to be a \"distraction\" for the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UK does not have an extradition treaty in place with Bangladesh. It is categorised as a 2B country, meaning clear evidence needs to be presented to lawyers and judges to authorise any extradition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Siddiq was not compelled to return to Dhaka for the trial despite authorities there issuing an arrest warrant. </p></div></div></body></html>"

Both were hit off the Turkish coast on Friday, with the Virat reportedly struck again on Saturday. No casualties were reported. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks appear to be an escalation by Kyiv as it tries to hit Russia's oil revenues, which are critical for funding its war in Ukraine.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Kairos was struck in the south-west area of the Black Sea and the Virat in a central area further east. Both are on a list of ships subject to sanctions, according to London Stock Exchange data.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attack employed Sea Baby drones - a type of naval drone produced by Ukraine's security services, known as the SBU.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Turkish authorities said they had been assisting the vessels, and released footage showing two Turkish boats trying to extinguish the fire on the Kairos.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The attacks are seen as a warning by Ukraine, suggesting that ships carrying Russian oil in the Black Sea face the risk of direct attack, not just Western sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, a major consortium transporting oil from the Caspian region said it had suspended loading in the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, after an attack by unmanned boats overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Caspian Pipeline Consortium said the attack had caused significant damage to a mooring point. Russia and Kazakhstan are major stakeholders in the company, which is also part-owned by Western firms including Exxon Mobil, Chevron and Shell.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister Aibek Smadiyarov expressed his indignation with the attack, which he said was the third of its kind.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Kazakhstan attached particular importance to ensuring a \"stable and uninterrupted\" energy supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident had harmed relations between his country and Ukraine, Smadiyarov added, calling on Kyiv \"to take concrete measures to prevent the recurrence of such situations\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation led by top security official Rustem Umerov was on its way to the US to continue talks on an agreement to end the war. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Umerov is set to lead the Ukrainian delegation as the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky's influential chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned after anti-corruption detectives <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0nljm4y74o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">searched his apartment</a> on Friday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian delegation is expected to meet US officials in Florida on Sunday.

Her father, a soldier, had been killed in battle.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\".

It sees the Sun transition from calm to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - massive bubbles of fire that blow out of the Sun's outermost layer called corona.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Made up of charged particles, a CME can weigh up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth. At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three CMEs a day,\" says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). \"Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it gathers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Studying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of India's maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images The aurora borealis glows above rural Monroe County as a strong geomagnetic storm from recent solar activity pushes the Northern Lights unusually far south on November 12, 2025, in Bloomington, Indiana.

Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a \"medium-sized\" one. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space.

It may affect production and exports of the country's famous feta cheese.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anastasia Siourtou walks through her deserted farm on the outskirts of Karditsa, a city in the Thessaly region of central Greece.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An eerie silence hangs over the place where 650 sheep were being raised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 12 November veterinary officials culled all the livestock after a case of sheep and goat pox was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is another farm two kilometres away. They had pox cases, but hid it,\" she says, alluding to how she believes her herd contracted the disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Siourtou is a veterinarian herself and has expanded the farm that her father built.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Losing the animals means financial ruin - besides the livestock the farm lost, the sheep's milk, which is sold for the production of feta cheese, is often referred to as Greece's \"white gold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than the financial blow, however, Ms Siourtou speaks of the emotional toll. \"I was here the day the sheep were culled. It is very cruel, I felt that I failed to protect them.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Anastasia Siourtou says she feels that she failed to protect her sheep</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat pox is a viral infection. The first cases were detected in northern Greece in August 2024, and the disease has since spread across many regions of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A total of 1,702 incidents had been recorded by mid-November, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Detecting a single case on a farm means the entire herd must be culled for preventive reasons. Some 417,000 sheep and goats have been disposed of so far, which is roughly 4-5% of the previous total.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Approximately 80% of Greek sheep and goat's milk <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2020/01/03/Everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-Feta\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">goes towards making feta cheese,</a> which is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/geographical-indications-and-quality-schemes/geographical-indications-food-and-drink/feta-pdo_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">protected designation of origin</a> within the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This means that while similar cheese can be produced elsewhere in the EU it cannot be called feta. The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feta has to be made of at least 70% sheep's milk, with the remainder being goat's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Small dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep's milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market,\" says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. \"The shop is closed,\" he says bitterly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. \"I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The day they were culled, I was here.

Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such vaccination is allowed in an emergency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/animal-diseases/diseases-and-control-measures/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under EU rules,</a> and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Tassos Manakas says he is closed for business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide.

However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Katsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open. In addition, the community requested a guarantee that they would not be attacked and that bandits would not enter the community with guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the bandits in Jibia, they requested access to clean drinking water and safe passage for their cattle as they moved to new grazing pastures. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also requested that their women be allowed to buy and trade in local markets.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP/Getty Images A Fulani man in silhouette in northern Nigeria tending cattle with long horns.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Cows are prized possessions for ethnic Fulanis, who walk for hundreds of miles to find pasture for them</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High on the agenda - for both sides - was the release of those kidnapped. The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Audu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Access to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult. It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life had become expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-chris-ewokor-in-abuja\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly.

My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life?
