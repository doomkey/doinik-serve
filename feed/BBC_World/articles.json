It's another sign of the steady Russian advance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, the last station is now on the western side of the Donetsk border. This is where civilians and soldiers wait for a ride towards relative safety - their train to get out of Dodge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin has been sounding more bullish since the leak of US proposals to end the war, widely seen as being in tune with his maximalist demands. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says territory remains the most difficult issue facing US-led peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the last station on the line, soldier Andrii and his girlfriend Polina are parting after an all-too-brief time together. Andrii has to return to the front and they don't know when they'll see each other again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He laughs when I mention peace talks, which have seen Donald Trump's envoys speak to Ukrainian negotiators before heading to Moscow, and dismisses them as \"chatter, just chatter\".

They are taking some of their 20 days of leave. Most look exhausted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russian forces now control some 85% of the Donbas, made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. On Tuesday they claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in Donetsk. Ukraine said fighting was continuing in the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denys, who has been serving in the Ukrainian army for the past two years, tells me \"everyone's drained, everyone's tired mentally and physically\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some of his comrades have already fallen asleep. His unit has been fighting in the besieged city of Kostyantynivka.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's scary, really scary,\" he says, describing drones flying around \"like flies\". But he makes it clear they are not ready to give up after sacrificing so much.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nobody will give Putin the Donbas. No way, it's our land,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ceding territory where at least a quarter of a million Ukrainians live - the Donetsk \"fortress belt\" cities of Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka - will not be acceptable to most Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has spent well over a year trying to capture Pokrovsk and Ukraine is reluctant to hand over such important strategic hubs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But US officials believe Ukraine is both outnumbered and outgunned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There's already been an exodus of civilians from the Donbas. It's continuing as  peace talks take place. We witness dozens, old and young, arriving at a reception centre just over the border in Lozova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They had taken advantage of heavy fog to make their escape. Less chance of being targeted by drones. Around 200 people arrive at this one reception centre every single day. They're given basic supplies and some money.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/431e/live/275255f0-cfab-11f0-932c-9d1f4bca4809.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Matthew Goddard A train station in the mist.

She had tried telling them the explosions they heard while seeking shelter in their cellar were just fireworks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The main thing is that there will be peace,\" Inna says. When I ask whether that means giving up her home for good, she replies, \"in this situation, yes\". They're already making plans to rebuild their lives elsewhere.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some soldiers sent to the Donbas are also voting with their feet. There have been nearly 300,000 cases of desertion, or soldiers going  absent without official leave, since the start of Russia's full scale invasion - and numbers have risen dramatically over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them is Serhii - not his real name. We met him in hiding. His home has become his prison as he tries to evade arrest. Serhii volunteered to fight at the start of the year, whereas most of the men in his unit were forcibly mobilised - \"taken off the street\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says his unit was already below strength when it was sent to the front, near Pokrovsk, and they weren't properly trained or equipped. \"I ended up in a battalion where everything was a mess,\" he says, although he still believes this was the exception, not the norm.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii deserted in May after two of his friends went awol.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I wouldn't have gone if we had proper leadership and someone experienced in charge,\" he says. \"I came to serve, not to run\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Serhii is still thinking about his next move, and the possibility of returning to the army. But he echoes recent US warnings that the odds in this war are stacked against Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked whether he believes Ukraine can win, he is doubtful. \"If you think logically, no.

Each announcement from US officials is usually accompanied by  grainy video, but no evidence of the alleged drug trafficking, and few details on who or what was on board each vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration says it is acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and have vowed congressional reviews of the strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats, including Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada, have also said that Hegseth should resign if he ordered a strike against the two people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If the reports are true, Pete Hegseth likely committed a war crime when he gave an illegal order that led to the killing of incapacitated survivors of the U.S. strike in the Caribbean,\" said Rosen, who sits on the Armed Services Committee, in a statement where she also called for a thorough investigation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Democrats on the committee, many of whom served in the military, had already requested that Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi publicly release the Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion that laid out the legal basis for the strikes, as some experts raised concerns that they could be unlawful</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During the Monday press briefing, Leavitt said that President Donald Trump and  Hegseth \"have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The press secretary neither confirmed whether the first strike left two survivors, nor that the second attack was intended to kill them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Media reports that Hegseth had given the directive to kill all those on board the vessel during the 2 September strike have renewed concerns about the legality of US military strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hegseth has pushed back against accusations in the report, calling them \"fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory\". On Monday, he tweeted that Admiral Bradley \"is an American hero, a true professional, and has my 100% support. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I stand by him and the combat decisions he has made — on the September 2 mission and all others since.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump: Hegseth said he 'did not order the death of those two men'</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks the US has expanded its military presence in the Caribbean, as part of what it calls an anti-narcotics operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump warned on Thursday that US efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking \"by land\" would begin \"very soon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the weekend, the Senate Armed Services Committee said it would be \"conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts\" related to the 2 September strikes. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Republican chairman of the committee, Senator Roger Wicker, said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the \"admiral that was in charge of the operation\". He added that it was also seeking audio and video to \"see what the orders were\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives also said it would lead a \"bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body of the highest-ranking US military officers, met both the House and Senate's armed services committees over the weekend. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Discussions centred around the operations in the region and \"the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks\", the group said. </p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. The survivors may have been subject to protections provided to shipwrecked sailors, or to those given to troops who have been rendered unable to continue fighting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The rules of engagement in such armed conflicts - as set out in the Geneva Conventions - forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be apprehended and cared for.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under former-President Barack Obama, the US military came under scrutiny for firing multiple rounds from drones, in a practice <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24557333\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">known as the \"double tap\"</a>, that sometimes resulted in civilian casualties. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Venezuela's National Assembly condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a \"rigorous and thorough investigation\" into the 2 September strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In an interview with BBC Newsnight on Monday, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab said Trump's allegations stem from \"great envy\" for the country's natural resources.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also called for a direct dialogue between the US and Venezuelan governments, \"to clear the toxic atmosphere we have witnessed since July of last year\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Sunday, Trump confirmed that he had held a brief phone call with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in which he pressured him to resign and leave Venezuela with his family. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to reports, during the call last month, Trump told Maduro that he could go to a destination of his choosing, but only if he agreed to depart immediately. After he refused, Trump posted on social media that the airspace over Venezuela should be considered \"closed in its entirety\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro requested amnesty for his top aides, and that he be allowed to continue control of the military after giving up the government. Trump refused both demands,  according to The Miami Post and Reuters, reporting the BBC has not confirmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US officials have alleged that Maduro himself is part of a \"terrorist\" organisation called the Cartel of the Suns, which they say includes high-ranking Venezuelan military and security officials involved in drug trafficking.

The code is  essentially the phone's serial number.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, India's Department of Telecommunications said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose \"serious endangerment\" to telecom cyber security.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"India has big second-hand mobile device market.

A Reuters report, citing official figures, says the app has helped recover more than 700,000 lost phones - including 50,000 in October alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But experts say the app's broad permissions raise concerns about how much data it can collect, widening the scope for surveillance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Technology analyst Prasanto K Roy says the bigger concern is about how much access an app might eventually be allowed on the handset.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We can't see exactly what it's doing, but we can see that it's asking for a great deal of permissions - potential access to just about everything from flashlight to camera. This is itself worrying,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Google's Play Store, the app says it doesn't collect or share any user data. The BBC has reached out to the department of telecommunications with questions about the app and the privacy concerns related to it.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Roy adds that compliance will be difficult, since the order runs counter to the policies of most handset-makers, including Apple.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">“Most companies prohibit installation of any government or third-party app before the sale of a smartphone,\" he says, \"barring in China and Russia”.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While India's smartphone market is dominated by Android, Apple's iOS powered an estimated 4.5% of the 735 million smartphones in the country by mid-2025, according to Counterpoint Research. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Apple has not commented publicly, but Reuters reports it does not intend to comply and \"will convey its concerns to Delhi\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India is not the only country to have tightened rules on device verification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August, Russia ordered all phones and tablets sold in the country to come pre-installed with the state-backed MAX messenger app, sparking similar privacy and surveillance concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"follow-bbc-news-india-on\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"instagram\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Instagram</i></a><i id=\",\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"youtube,\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">YouTube,</i></a><i id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"></a><i id=\"and\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"facebook\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Facebook</i></a><i id=\".\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years and the death toll could rise further as officials continue to recover bodies.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct \"comprehensive reform\", adding that he would work to \"prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked at a news conference why he should keep his job, Mr Lee acknowledged that reform was needed but failed to directly address the question. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Yes, it is a tragedy, it is a big fire. Yes, we need reform. Yes, we have identified failures in different stages. That is exactly why we must act seriously to ensure that all these loopholes are plucked,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fire - which spread quickly both upwards and between the blocks - was only fully doused by Friday morning, some 40 hours after it started, and took more than 2,000 firefighters to bring under control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The same day, police began entering the buildings to gather evidence. Authorities say the investigation could take three to four weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out. Hong Kong's fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ef12/live/a89036a0-cf42-11f0-8564-7b16d0b8c391.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Firemen get ready after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The fire is the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Separately, police reportedly detained a 24-year-old man on suspicion of sedition on Saturday.

whether prosecutors illegally obtained evidence from Mr <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/videos/c7vez5y57y8o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Mangione when they arrested him</a> in

after being arrested - including allegedly giving them a false name.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They argue he did so before police read him his rights, including the right to remain silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His attorneys are also hoping to exclude from the trial a 9mm handgun that prosecutors say matches the one used in the killing, as well as writings found

written in his notebook about \"the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But defence lawyers are arguing his backpack was searched without a warrant,

href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceqlj130rxpo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">DNA or fingerprints</a> on items discarded near the crime scene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's attorneys are probably aware of the long odds of getting evidence excluded, Mr Shakhnevich said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that the main reason why defence lawyers hold these type of proceedings is to preview trial testimony from law enforcement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So far, the court has heard from New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Sgt Chris McLaughlin, who was asked to review surveillance images from after the shooting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors in court also played CCTV showing the killing. A worker who handled security cameras at the McDonald's in Altoona testified as well.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prosecutors played a 911 call for the court from a manager at the fast food restaurant who said customers had told her one patron looked like the suspect in Mr Thompson's killing.<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>The manager said she had looked online for pictures of him but could only make out Mr Mangione's eyebrows as he ate in the restaurant, since he wore a hat and face mask. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The court also heard from a correctional officer at the jail where Mr Mangione was being held who said he appeared \"unbothered and logical\" as the two discussed literature and health care, though Mr Mangione did not give his opinion on the latter topic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The officer said Mr Mangione was placed under a high level of security because they wanted to avoid an \"Epstein-style situation\", a reference to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while in a federal detention centre. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shakhnevich said the legal team wants to have this type of information from witnesses so they can be aware of what people might say at trial, and to be on the lookout for any inconsistencies in their statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The benefit of the hearing is that you get to have law enforcement officials testify, and you get to bind them to testimony for a trial later on,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Mangione's legal team has also been pushing to bar the federal government from <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c30qlr528elo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">seeking the death penalty</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They have said comments from high-ranking officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing Mr Mangione of the murder have prejudiced his case, which they claim is motivated by politics.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In Sri Lanka, at least 390 people died, while in Thailand the death toll has reached at least 176.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, there is no single weather event that has caused the floods. Instead, a combination of weather features have been to blame.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to BBC Weather, one element is the north-east monsoon, which affects East and South Asia from around November until March. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the name suggests, it brings north-easterly winds, which deliver a lot of rain to coastal areas exposed to this monsoon flow as moisture is picked up from the ocean and deposited over land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Sri Lanka, the rainfall has been significantly enhanced by Cyclonic Storm Ditwah, which became very slow moving, delivering over half a metre of rain over a few days in some locations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That storm has now weakened and moved away northwards to bring rain in south-east India, with the forecast for Sri Lanka looking much drier over the coming days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and southern Thailand, Cyclonic Storm Senyar had a similar effect, enhancing the monsoon and delivering more than a metre of rain in some places. This was a particularly rare storm, forming unusually close to the equator where cyclones do not normally develop.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vietnam, the last few weeks have been exceptionally wet, with the monsoon rains having been enhanced by tropical cyclones. Now the remnants of ex-Typhoon Koto are drifting towards the Vietnamese coast, threatening more heavy downpours and further flooding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is likely that climate change has also had a part to play. While global warming is not expected to lead to more tropical storms and cyclones, those that do occur have the potential to be more intense - with heavier rainfall leading to more flooding.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The goal of EU membership is enshrined in Georgia's constitution.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Konstantine Chakhunashvili ran a study on protesters' symptoms after he himself suffered ill-effects from the water cannon</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia's police responded with a variety of riot-control measures including the use of water cannon, pepper spray and CS gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili, a paediatrician who was among those sprayed by the cannons, and who has taken part in many of the demonstrations, said his skin felt like it was burning for days, and the sensation couldn't be washed away. In fact, he said, \"it was worse when trying to wash it off\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili wanted to find out if others had suffered similar effects. So he appealed, via social media, for those also targeted by crowd control measures during the first week of the demonstrations to fill out a survey. Nearly 350 people got in touch, and almost half said they had suffered one or more side-effects for more than 30 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These long-term symptoms ranged from headaches, to fatigue, coughs, shortness of breath and vomiting.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His study has since been peer reviewed and has been accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sixty-nine of those surveyed by Dr Chakhunashvili were also examined by him and found to have \"significantly higher prevalence of abnormalities\" in the electrical signals in the heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dr Chakhunashvili's report echoed the conclusion that local journalists, doctors, and civil rights organisations had come to - that the water cannon must have been laced with a chemical. They had called on the government to identify what had been used, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs - responsible for the police - refused.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several high-level whistleblowers connected to the Special Tasks Department - the official name of Georgia's riot police - helped the BBC determine this chemical's likely identity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former head of weaponry at the department, Lasha Shergelashvili, believes it is the same compound he was asked to test for use in water cannon in 2009.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c17/live/753a04a0-cb89-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Lasha Shergelashvili Lasha wearing army fatigues and a cap standing on an armoured vehicle and resting his arm on a mounted rifle \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Lasha Shergelashvili</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Lasha Shergelashvili used to be in charge of weaponry for Georgia's riot police</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The effects of that product, he says, were unlike anything he had previously experienced. He found it difficult to breathe after standing close to where it had been sprayed, and he and the 15-20 colleagues who tested it with him could not easily wash it off.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We noticed that the effect was not wearing off, as is the case for [regular] tear gas. Even after we washed our faces with water, and then with a special solution of baking soda and water, which was prepared in advance, we still couldn't breathe freely.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Shergelashvili says that as a result of his tests, he recommended against the chemical's use.

These were simply listed as \"Chemical liquid UN1710\" and \"Chemical powder UN3439\", along with instructions for how they should be mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We wanted to check whether this inventory was authentic, so we showed it to another  former high-ranking police officer from the riot police who confirmed it seemed genuine. He identified the two unnamed chemicals as those likely to have been added into the water cannon.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our next step was to work out what these chemicals were.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN1710 was easy to identify as this is the code for trichloroethylene (TCE), a solvent that enables other chemicals to dissolve in water. We then had to work out which chemical it was helping to dissolve.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN3439 was much harder to identify because it is an umbrella code for a whole range of industrial chemicals, all of which are hazardous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The only one of these we found to have ever been used as a riot-control agent is bromobenzyl cyanide, also known as camite, developed by the Allies for use in World War One.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We asked Prof Christopher Holstege, a world leading toxicology and chemical weapons expert, to assess whether our evidence pointed to camite being the likely agent used.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f8e/live/6d293540-cbbd-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Shutterstock Hundreds of people demonstrating in the Georgian capital - massing on the street in the darkness with the parliament lit up to the side.

Camite is markedly irritating [and] persistent with its irritation.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He speculated it would have been used because it would act as a strong deterrent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would keep people away for a long time. They couldn't decontaminate [themselves]. They would have to go to the hospital. They would have to leave the area. If that is indeed the case - that this chemical has been brought back - that is actually exceedingly dangerous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Camite was briefly used as a riot control agent by the American police post-World War One, but was abandoned after safer options such as CS gas were invented.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under international law, police forces are allowed to use chemicals as crowd-control agents as long as they are considered proportionate and have only short-term effects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Given there are safer and more conventional riot-control agents available to police, an obsolete and more potent agent could be classed as a chemical weapon, according to weapons experts consulted by the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Our findings were concerning, said UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Edwards. Ms Edwards has previously written to Georgia's government regarding allegations of police violence and torture during the protests.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The UN's Alice Edwards: \"Populations should never be subjected to experiments\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lack of strict regulation around the use of chemicals in water cannon is a problem she would like addressed: \"It does lead me to consider [this practice] as an experimental weapon. And populations should never be subjected to experiments. This is absolutely in violation of human rights law.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She stressed that any effect of a riot control measure should be temporary under international law, and that the symptoms described \"are beyond what would be considered temporary and acceptable. So all of those cases should be investigated, including under the rubric of torture or other ill-treatment\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Georgia's authorities described our findings as \"deeply frivolous\" and \"absurd\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It said that law enforcement had acted \"within the bounds of the law and constitution\" when responding to the \"illegal actions of brutal criminals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests on Tbilisi's Rustaveli Avenue have dwindled in their size since the government increased fines and jail terms, but not in their frequency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c208w378gg7o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Almost every night for the past year</a>, demonstrators have called for the resignation of a government they accuse of rigging elections, siding with Russian interests, and passing increasingly draconian legislation against civil society.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The ruling Georgian Dream party denied the government or the party's honorary chairman, Bidzina Ivanishvili, are either pro-Russian or pursuing Russian interests.

These militias are part of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces and are widely seen in the country as wielding considerable behind-the-scenes power in government and in commerce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the brief periods between torture, she tried to strategise. \"I had to learn all sorts of weird conspiracy theories. They live in an alternative reality in which Israel and the United States and Saudi Arabia together created ISIS [the Islamic State group], and the US spreads homosexuality through single sex cafes.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She created confessions about herself to try to avoid torture, based on spy plots and her captors' \"quite insane worldview\", while not implicating any Iraqis. Many of her friends, she says, were activists whom the militants also wanted to kidnap and torture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But her strategy had one major downside. \"They would torture me so I would give them these confessions that I would invent, and then they simply got greedy. So, they would return, hang me by my wrists and start beating me with a stick and using even harsher methods of torture and saying, 'I want something new.'\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov says she does not understand why, after 100 days of abuse, she was moved to another location. She was still in solitary confinement with no outside light, but the torture stopped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What she is certain about is how she came to be released. The US businessman Mark Savaya, who campaigned for Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, was appointed US special envoy to Iraq this October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Ms Tsurkov, one month before, he had travelled to Baghdad to speak to Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Among the messages he conveyed, she says, was that President Trump was extremely annoyed about her captivity, and that if she were not freed within a week, the leadership of Kataib Hezbollah would be killed. Within days, she was released.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When he announced Ms Tsurkov's freedom from captivity on 9 September, Iraq's prime minister described it as \"a culmination of extensive efforts exerted by our security services over the course of many months\". He also stressed Iraq's commitment to law enforcement and state authority.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He made no mention of Kataib Hezbollah or any US threat. But two weeks later, a senior official in Kataib Hezbollah, Abu Ali al-Askari, put out a statement saying that Sudani's government had sought Ms Tsurkov's release in order to prevent a US strike on Iraq and to oblige the US to comply with its agreement to withdraw its forces from the country. He also claimed that Ms Tsurkov had been released after \"giving out all the information she had\" under interrogation by the \"entity\" holding her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US State Department did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b63d/live/270a5f40-cee1-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters File photo showing a mourner carrying a Kataib Hezbollah flag during a funeral in Baghdad, Iraq, for a commander of the Iraqi militia who was killed in an Israeli strike in Syria (22 September 2024)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">President Trump said Ms Tsurkov was held by Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov's long road to rehabilitation - mental and physical - is beginning in Israel. But she is determined to complete her PhD at Princeton. Since her release, she has watched the parties associated with the Iran-backed militias grow in strength in recent parliamentary elections in Iraq.  More broadly, she says, it is ordinary Iraqis who lose out from a \"horribly corrupt system in an incredibly rich country\", where the commanders of the militias \"continue to operate above the law\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov, who has lived in Israel since her release, says she sees a country transformed in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 and Israel's protracted war in Gaza. \"I'm undergoing therapy, and many of the kind of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder are collectively experienced by Israelis since October 7th. There's a great sense of insecurity and desire to unleash the anger that exists within people.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Tsurkov has been a long-standing critic of Israeli government policy towards Palestinians and within the region. She has a wide circle of Palestinian, Lebanese and Iraqi friends. She's worked for the Israel NGO Gisha, which campaigns to protect freedom of movement for Palestinians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The events of the last two years have, she says, left her much more pessimistic about the possibility of peace. \"October 7th was a literal massacre of the left, because many of the people who live in the kibbutzim, the communities along the Gaza border, were peace activists. And it's a massacre of the left in the sense that the voices who support peace have gotten much weaker and more demonised.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More immediately, she has her own recovery to concentrate on. She had, she says, previously worked with victims of torture. \"But nothing prepares you for the horror of undergoing it.\" She also reveals the toll of the false confessions. \"It kind of seeps through in some way; maybe like the situation of a battered wife who internalises to some extent the view of the abuser of herself.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is one key fact to cling to: that she got out. \"For sure, I have more recovery ahead of me. But I think I was lucky, in a very unlucky situation.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Some environmentalists, however, claim as much as 1.5 million tonnes was spilled, with one expert saying a full clean-up could take longer than a decade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The spill has killed the fish around the towns of Chambishi and Kitwe, made the water undrinkable and destroyed crops, farmers have told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are fears that, now the rainy season has started, heavy metals still sitting in the mud will further infiltrate the land and waterways, causing a second wave of pollution.

The mine is owned by Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, a subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned firm, which has created - according to Chinese sources - more than 2,000 jobs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chinese companies like these provide jobs and much needed revenue in Africa. Although the US has recently become the biggest foreign investor across the continent, China is still one of the largest investors in Africa's rich minerals and metals industry - not least in Zambia's Copperbelt Province, the scene of the dam collapse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 30,000 jobs have been created by Chinese companies across Zambia, according to the Chinese embassy. Investment from China was estimated to be worth $1.7bn (£1.3bn) last year. And - in a sign of the close links between the two countries - Chinese Premier Li Qiang visited Zambia late last month, ahead of the G20 Leaders' Summit in South Africa. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But China has also been accused of neocolonialism, with critics arguing that its infrastructure loans trap African countries in unmanageable debt, that it doesn't upskill local workers, preferring to bring its own in instead, and that its focus on mineral extraction sometimes comes at the expense of safeguarding the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In September, 176 farmers filed an $80bn (£58bn) lawsuit against Sino Metals and NFC Africa, the Chinese firm that owns the land the mine is on. It is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers alleging the spillage has already affected 300,000 households.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They say the dam's collapse was caused by a number of factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The lawsuit is being seen by some as a test case of how much African countries can hold China accountable for wrongdoing in their territories.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All eyes are on this case,\" says Prof Stephen Chan from the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Because of the huge extent of the damage that has been caused, the huge extent of the carelessness that was very obviously involved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People found it hard to believe at first \"because something of this scale had not happened before,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chinese embassy in Zambia says Sino Metals has cooperated fully with the investigation into the incident, that compensation has been paid to 454 households and that all staff at the site have continued to be employed and receive their salaries, despite a six-month pause in mining.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts, however, argue the incident shows that Zambia needs to prioritise safety, sustainability and the national interest when dealing with Chinese companies. The power dynamic could be further complicated by the estimated $5bn debt (£3.7bn) Zambia owes to China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But this debt does not hamper the Zambian government's ability to deal with the crisis, insists the Permanent Secretary for Green Economy and Environment, Dr Douty Chibamba.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is no treating them [China] with kid gloves here,\" he told the BBC in a rare, sit-down interview. \"We don't care whether we owe them, that's not the issue.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zambia is not alone in owing money to the Chinese.

These measures are currently being implemented, according to the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sino Metals might have to pay more after a full assessment of the area has been made, says the government. At the time of the spill, the company pledged to compensate the affected communities and restore the environment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial payments have already been made to some locals in the Copperbelt. Some told us they had received as much as $3,000 (£2,400) in compensation from Sino Metals - but others said they had got as little as $700 (£500) from the company.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One contract we saw suggests that some locals have signed away their entitlement to any further compensation when they accepted these initial payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the presence of a second superpower in the country may help the Zambian government to get even more money out of Sino Metals, according to Prof Stephan Chan. The United States has also been courting the southern African country economically and politically. Zambian copper, important in the global transition to cleaner energy, is in high demand - as well as reserves of another metal, cobalt, used in electric car batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Chinese don't have that much leverage over Zambia because it has a foreign policy that also speaks to the Americans,\" says Prof Chan. \"The last thing the Chinese want is to drive the Zambians closer to the Americans.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Total trade between Zambia and the US was worth an estimated $296m (£226m) in 2024. And there are recent signs that both countries are becoming closer diplomatically, with some regional commentators suggesting the US may be turning to Zambia as a preferred ally in southern Africa because of increased tensions with neighbouring South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African countries, including Zambia, are choosing to work with different superpowers to meet their needs, Prof Chan says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not Africa being taken for a ride, it's Africa coming of age, becoming a player in the world, with all of the different actors in the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">African governments are \"not always getting it right\", he says, however \"this is not something you get right at the very beginning. Africa is becoming fully integrated in a complex world, making mistakes, the same kind of mistakes that other countries everywhere make.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For its part, China denies taking advantage of Zambia, and told the BBC it was \"grossly unfair\" to characterise Beijing's relationship with African countries as neocolonial.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Most in Zambia would agree that the Chinese investors and the Chinese community as a whole are bringing to this country the much needed capital, technology, skills training opportunities, job creation and managerial expertise - and they are doing their best to blend in as law-abiding and responsible players,\" a statement from the Chinese embassy in Lusaka says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It would be grossly unfair to label China-Zambia and China-Africa cooperation as neocolonialism based on the opinions of very few, while neglecting the larger picture of win-win cooperation between China and Zambia, and the wider Africa.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-ed-habershon\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Ed Habershon</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Her father, a soldier, had been killed in battle.

class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Francis wrote in his autobiography that when his papacy began in 2013, he felt that he would only have two or three years in the role. He certainly acted like a man on a mission, quickly trying to put into motion his vision for the Church.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six months into his papacy, Pope Leo still looks like a man who is taking in the gravity of the role, and weighing up his options. There are times when he can appear slightly emotional about where he finds himself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit in Istanbul, as he stood at the altar before the congregation made up of the tiny Christian minority that had welcomed him so warmly and joined worship with him, the pope took a moment where he even appeared to be holding back tears.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a way, it was reminiscent of that moment in May when he stepped on to the balcony of St Peter's Basilica, having just agreed to take on the daunting task of leading well over a billion people in something so personal and sensitive as their faith.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a statesman leading the Vatican, he can often appear to be in listening mode, but on this trip, Pope Leo has shown that he can still issue some strong statements.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Standing next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he decried powerful countries flexing their economic and military might, blaming that for heightened levels of conflict around the world and saying \"the future of humanity is at stake\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At an event marking 1,700 years since a hugely significant Christian council in what is now the Turkish city of Iznik, he said: \"We must strongly reject the use of religion for justifying war, violence, or any form of fundamentalism or fanaticism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the plane from Istanbul to Beirut, when addressing the decades old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, he said the only solution had to include a Palestinian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all know that at this time Israel still does not accept that solution,\" he said but quickly followed that up by saying the Vatican was still \"friends with Israel\" and was seeking to be a mediating voice.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ab27/live/b5210000-ce36-11f0-b0ac-d13c1508eb1d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Excited young women in Islamic scarves wave papal flags outside a building.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">People of all major faiths turned out in southern Beirut with papal flags </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pope Leo's first act in Lebanon, a country with huge governance issues, was to sit alongside the country's leading politicians and remind them they should be dedicated to the service of their people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Pope himself has described the purpose of his visit to both Turkey and Lebanon as to be \"a messenger of peace\".

It sees the Sun transition from calm to stormy and is marked by a huge increase in the number of solar storms and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) - massive bubbles of fire that blow out of the Sun's outermost layer called corona.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Made up of charged particles, a CME can weigh up to a trillion kilograms and can attain a speed of up to 3,000km (1,864 miles) per second. It can head out in any direction, including towards the Earth. At top speed, it would take a CME 15 hours to cover the 150 million km Earth-Sun distance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the normal or low-activity times, the Sun launches two to three CMEs a day,\" says Prof R Ramesh of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). \"Next year, we expect them to be 10 or more daily.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Ramesh is the principal investigator on Visible Emission Line Coronagraph, or Velc - the most important of the seven scientific instruments on Aditya-L1 - and closely monitors and decodes the data it gathers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Studying CMEs is one of the most important scientific objectives of India's maiden solar mission, he says. One, because the ejections provide an opportunity to learn about the star at the centre of our solar system, and two, because activities that take place on the Sun threaten infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c71b/live/73677c60-cc2a-11f0-83b4-73da040a79fa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images The aurora borealis glows above rural Monroe County as a strong geomagnetic storm from recent solar activity pushes the Northern Lights unusually far south on November 12, 2025, in Bloomington, Indiana.

Its mass was 270 million tonnes - the iceberg that sank Titanic was 1.5 million tonnes, he says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At origin, its temperature was 1.8 million degrees Celsius and the energy content was equivalent to 2.2 million megatons of TNT – in comparison, the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 15 kilotons and 21 kilotons respectively. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though the numbers make it sound incredibly large, Prof Ramesh describes it as a \"medium-sized\" one. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The asteroid which wiped out the dinosaurs on Earth was 100 million megatons and during the Sun's maximum activity cycle, he says, we could see CMEs with energy content equal to even more than that.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I consider the CME we evaluated to have occurred when the Sun was in the normal activity phase. Now this sets the benchmark that we'll be using to evaluate what is in store when the maximum activity cycle occurs,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The learnings from this will help us work out the countermeasures to be adopted to protect satellites in near space.

It may affect production and exports of the country's famous feta cheese.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anastasia Siourtou walks through her deserted farm on the outskirts of Karditsa, a city in the Thessaly region of central Greece.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An eerie silence hangs over the place where 650 sheep were being raised.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On 12 November veterinary officials culled all the livestock after a case of sheep and goat pox was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There is another farm two kilometres away. They had pox cases, but hid it,\" she says, alluding to how she believes her herd contracted the disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Siourtou is a veterinarian herself and has expanded the farm that her father built.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Losing the animals means financial ruin - besides the livestock the farm lost, the sheep's milk, which is sold for the production of feta cheese, is often referred to as Greece's \"white gold\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than the financial blow, however, Ms Siourtou speaks of the emotional toll. \"I was here the day the sheep were culled. It is very cruel, I felt that I failed to protect them.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Anastasia Siourtou says she feels that she failed to protect her sheep</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat pox is a viral infection. The first cases were detected in northern Greece in August 2024, and the disease has since spread across many regions of the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A total of 1,702 incidents had been recorded by mid-November, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Rural Development and Food.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Detecting a single case on a farm means the entire herd must be culled for preventive reasons. Some 417,000 sheep and goats have been disposed of so far, which is roughly 4-5% of the previous total.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Approximately 80% of Greek sheep and goat's milk <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2020/01/03/Everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-Feta\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">goes towards making feta cheese,</a> which is a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/farming/geographical-indications-and-quality-schemes/geographical-indications-food-and-drink/feta-pdo_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">protected designation of origin</a> within the European Union.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This means that while similar cheese can be produced elsewhere in the EU it cannot be called feta. The UK continues to respect this 2002 ruling following Brexit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year, Greece exported €785m ($909m; £690m) of feta, figures from the Greek Exports Association show. Of this, €520m went to fellow EU nations, and €90m to the UK.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Feta has to be made of at least 70% sheep's milk, with the remainder being goat's.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Small dairies say they are already having problems sourcing sheep's milk, which could mean possible shortages of feta going forward. While prices have not yet increased in turn, this will likely be the result if the outbreak is not eradicated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The limited amount of available milk increases production costs and makes it more difficult to maintain current quantities [of feta] on the market,\" says Prof Dimitris Gougoulis from the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Thessaly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another sheep farmer near Karditsa, Tassos Manakas, saw his 873-strong herd culled on 9 October.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He now spends his days sitting in a small room in his barn. \"The shop is closed,\" he says bitterly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Manakas walks past the empty metal feeders and the milking room now gathering cobwebs. \"I used to come in in the morning, hear the animals bleating, stroke them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The day they were culled, I was here.

Farmers respond that the payments fall far short of covering their losses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has also been criticised for its wider response to the outbreak. A National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox was only established only in late October - a full 14 months after the first case was detected.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, no lockdown zones were established in the areas where the first cases were recorded in late summer of 2024, and critics say that the state veterinary service is significantly understaffed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the same time, farmers have been arrested for the illegal transport of animals in trucks into areas considered disease-free. And local reports say infected animals have been buried in fields without notifying the authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesman for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food tells the BBC: \"We implemented the plan to eradicate sheep pox from the very beginning, as provided for in the European protocols.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The result was to reach almost zero cases in the spring of 2025. The decision to establish the scientific committee in October 2025 was taken under the pressure of one factor - many farmers did not comply with biosecurity measures, resulting in an explosion in cases.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greece's Supreme Court has now ruled that prosecutors must investigate possible violations of biosecurity measures, which many critics say is overdue.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Across the country, there are still farms operating under 1960s standards – tin shacks, walls made of baked soil or cement bricks, and no fencing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC visited one such farm on the outskirts of the city of Larissa, in Thessaly. Two dead lambs were lying on the ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner insisted that there were no cases of pox on his farm. He refused to allow photographs. \"Some animals have lumps on their chest. It's not pox, but no one will believe me,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sheep and goat farmers in Thessaly are calling for approval of mass vaccination of their herds, which they say is how the problem is tackled in Bulgaria and Turkey.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Such vaccination is allowed in an emergency <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/animals/animal-diseases/diseases-and-control-measures/sheep-pox-and-goat-pox_en\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">under EU rules,</a> and farmers are putting a lot of pressure on the government to request vaccines from the Commission's available stock.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the Greek government responds that mass vaccination could lead to Greece being classified as an endemic country for the diseases, which would bring restrictions on the export of sheep and goat's milk - and especially of feta cheese. Greek authorities also stress that there is currently no certified vaccine against sheep pox.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Gougoulis points out that the existing older vaccines are effective in countries where pox is endemic, but \"are not a tool for eradication [of the disease]\". \"They do not completely prevent infection, and the virus can continue to circulate within vaccinated populations.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Farmer Tassos Manakas says he is closed for business</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet the situation now seems to be getting out of control.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the National Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox recently told journalists that livestock farmers in different parts of the country may have carried out as many as one million illegal vaccinations. This distorts the epidemiological picture and makes disease control even more difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But many livestock farmers are angry with the officials' assumption. They say it is an arbitrary calculation and accuse the scientific committee of endangering the export of feta.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Farmer Haris Seskliotis, in the village of Rizomylos near Volos, listens to all this with deep concern. One infection was detected on his farm, leading to the preventive culling of 700 sheep.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was the second time his farm was ruined, following the devastating floods in Thessaly in 2023.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's extremely harsh,\" he tells the BBC, walking through his sheep empty pens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are stacks of hay bales around meant for sheep to eat, now left unused in the yard of the farm and soon to rot.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Seskliotis is not the kind of farmer who sits and counts his wounds. \"I am thinking of setting up a new unit with my son for fattening calves,\" he says. \"We have not learned anything other than raising herds.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"links-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"><div class=\"sc-666b6d83-0 sc-c4fb5674-0 jYmMqa kGPvxx\"><span data-testid=\"links-title\" class=\"sc-c4fb5674-2 bBuHEW\">Read more global business stories</span></div></div></article></div></body></html>"

About 250 are still reportedly missing, though state officials have said this number is exaggerated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The incident is part of a recent wave of mass abductions in north and central Nigeria - some of which have been blamed on criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", who see kidnapping for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our village is remote, we are close to the bandits,\" explained Aliyu, whose son is still among the missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's a three-hour drive to where they hide.

However, if they are not paid hostages can be - and have been - killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Relatives tend to crowdfund or in the case of mass school abductions, the authorities are sometimes suspected of negotiating for their release.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind these two recent school kidnappings, though the government has recently told the BBC it believes it was jihadists, not bandits, who are responsible. Locals in Kebbi and Niger states are likely to be curious for more information on this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yusuf, the legal guardian to some of the Maga girls and whose name has also been changed to protect his identity, believes such kidnappings could not have happened without informants in the community.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All these abductions are not common in Kebbi. These kidnappings can only happen with the connivance of someone from the community, because no stranger can come to a place and pull something like this off without the help of locals,\" he told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They need the help of someone who knows the terrain very well.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there has been a surprising change of approach in some areas where villages have been at the mercy of bandits for the last decade and have given up hope of getting help from the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has led some of these rural communities, who live in close proximity to the kidnapping gangs and in the woeful absence of effective policing, to come up with their own solutions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In the north-west, those communities that have been severely affected by these mass kidnappings have struck so-called peace deals with these bandits in exchange for access to mines,\" David Nwaigwe, a security analyst for security risk consulting firm SBM Intelligence, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many states in the north-west are rich in untapped mineral deposits - especially gold, a profitable prospect for bandit gangs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These deals, according to Mr Nwaigwe, have been effective in some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we've seen over time is that there seems to be some sort of a decline in the rate of attacks,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Katsina state, in Nigeria's far north, is a case in point. It has long been synonymous with insecurity - particularly banditry and mass kidnappings. But in the past year, things have begun to shift, thanks in part to several peace deals struck between bandit leaders and community leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting on mats under the shade of wide trees, representatives from both sides hash out their terms and conditions before eventually coming to an agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Bandit leaders have been willing to negotiate, though have faced criticism for attending peace talks armed with AK47 guns and other weapons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The area of Jibia was an early adopter of the peace negotiation process, reaching a deal in March this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After enduring more than 10 years of insecurity, life had become untenable, said community leader and lawyer Ibrahim Sabiu, who represented Jibia during the peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our homes and sources of livelihood were destroyed,\" he told the BBC in September.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Schools and hospitals all closed down. Hundreds of people were killed and hundreds more kidnapped for ransom.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A main stipulation of the peace deal was that the schools re-open. In addition, the community requested a guarantee that they would not be attacked and that bandits would not enter the community with guns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for the bandits in Jibia, they requested access to clean drinking water and safe passage for their cattle as they moved to new grazing pastures. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They also requested that their women be allowed to buy and trade in local markets.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c2e/live/ade68bd0-cc9b-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP/Getty Images A Fulani man in silhouette in northern Nigeria tending cattle with long horns.\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Cows are prized possessions for ethnic Fulanis, who walk for hundreds of miles to find pasture for them</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">High on the agenda - for both sides - was the release of those kidnapped. The BBC does not know how many people were released in Jibia, but 37 villagers had been freed in Kurfi, another area of Katsina state, by late September - a month after a deal was struck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We had to accept the peace offer because there was no end in sight to the violence,\" said Mr Sabiu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is a crisis that the police should handle but the security agencies were brought in and yet, they couldn't end it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Audu Abdullahi Ofisa, a bandit leader who took part in the Jibia talks, endorsed the move towards peace: \"Life is full of ups and downs, we are happy to go into another phase.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rural communities stand to gain from a return to peace, but what is less immediately obvious is why bandits have entered into peace processes - especially in cases where gold mines were not part of the deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Access to ransom money has traditionally made banditry a lucrative endeavour, yet in Kurfi, it was bandit leaders who requested peace talks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They live relatively nomadic lives, which makes access to clean drinking water difficult. It also drives up the prices of food because they are not able to access markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Life had become expensive and uncomfortable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all tired of violence,\" Nasiru Bosho, one of the bandit leaders who took part in the Kurfi peace negotiations, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We were all living together in the same community until the unfortunate violence began. We have agreed to live and let live. No more harassment or kidnapping by either side.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is also a view that such communities have been bled dry and can no longer come up with ransom payments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While peace deals in the north like those struck in Kurfi and Jibia have yielded tentative security gains, analysts say that this has only shifted insecurity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some gangs may find it more rewarding to set their sights on regions further south.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"As you move further south, people are better off economically,\" said Mr Nwaigwe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The more these gangs push southwards, the more they're likely to find places that they can attack. Parents in those schools are more able to gather enough funds to pay ransoms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In a lot of the north-west whole rural communities have been vacated. Anybody that has the means, has left the rural areas to run towards the major city centres.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some have questioned whether the resurgence in attacks in the last few weeks is linked to Donald Trump's recent threats of military intervention in Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president criticised the Nigerian government for failing to adequately protect Christians from attacks by Islamist insurgents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A jihadist insurgency erupted in the north-east of the country in 2009 - and the kidnapping of more than 200 girls by Boko Haram militants from Chibok 11 years ago was one of the first mass abductions.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government and security analysts have been at pains to point out that both Muslims and Christians have been targets in mass kidnappings. For example, the BBC was told the schoolgirls recently abducted from Maga were Muslim.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Nigeria's security situation is now very complicated. We don't know how to draw the lines between violent extremist groups or bandits. Because they operate almost in the same areas and in a fluid manner,\" Christian Ani, from the Institute for Security Studies, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He is not convinced there is a resurgence of high-profile mass kidnapping of schoolchildren because of Trump's comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They might have ideological motives but they're more motivated by profit,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Nwaigwe agrees one cannot make a causal link between Trump's comments and the recent uptick in attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For now, I just think they're just going after soft targets like schools because they're easy to get money from. It's too early to draw other conclusions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As far as he is concerned, stopping the violence will require a two-pronged approach - a combination of armed confrontation and negotiating amnesty deals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's kind of like the stick and carrot approach - show them that you can use overwhelming military force against them, then try to convince the rest to surrender,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think purely using military power is going to work here, you need to complement that with other measures.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for the parents of Papiri, the prospect of living peacefully with the enemy remains a far-off dream as they pray for their children's safe return.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-the-bbc's-chris-ewokor-in-abuja\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by the BBC's Chris Ewokor in Abuja</i></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Should I drink another one?'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amanda doesn't think people will pay much attention to the health warnings and reckons they might even make some more inclined to drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I just don't think they care,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a night out in Dublin Amanda says she will usually limit herself to a maximum of three drinks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I like to be in control of what I do when I'm out,\" she says. \"I don't really drink that much for letting loose.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She's mindful of how young people are perceived on social media, and that influences her own drinking choices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't like taking photos with myself with a glass of wine or Guinness,\" she says. \"You don't want to be in compromising positions, you don't want people to have a negative image.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Amanda has seen the new warning labels on alcohol - but isn't sure how effective they'll be</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Twenty-one-year-old Sean lives in the capital and likes to socialise with friends - some are drinkers, while others are not.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike in other parts of Europe, Sean says if you want to socialise in the evenings there aren't many options here, other than going to the pub.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's not much to do in Dublin after a certain time,\" Sean says. \"Six to seven or so the city kind of shuts down. At times you'd just be like, 'I'm really not in the humour to have a pint, but I want to sit somewhere and see my friends' - so you have to get a pint.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's seen the alcohol warning labels too, but isn't sure they will put him off drinking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Everyone kinda knows it's bad for you, but we do it anyway,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cigarette warning labels are \"far more graphic\", Sean's friend Mark adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ireland was the front-runner in restricting smoking and since 2004 you can't smoke in the workplace or restaurants and bars.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sean (left) with friends Mark, Ted, Nikita, Darragh and James in a courtyard near Temple Bar, Dublin's nightlife hub </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even before the introduction of the new warning labels, some young Irish people in their 20s have been finding they are better off without alcohol in their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mark rarely drinks. It's \"one for my birthday, one for Christmas\", he says, in part because alcohol is expensive and it's cheaper to opt for something else.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't really like the taste of it,\" the 21-year-old says. \"Guinness is probably the one I would have, but also the cost of it - I am saving so much money by just getting the Club Orange.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen is 27 and when she was younger used to drink regularly. Although she hasn't given up alcohol completely, like Mark she says she can largely live without it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The last time I had a drink was February,\" Helen says. \"It just kind of dwindled off to this point where I'm more or less sober, but I just don't identify as that because I may have a drink again - or maybe I won't.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sam and Helen are good friends who encourage each other not to drink</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Helen's friend Sam - who started drinking when he was \"16 or 17\" - has gone a step further.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a bit of fun then [I] went to college and the drinking kind of took off,\" Sam, who's now 27, says. \"One day I just kind of realised it was going too far. My dad said to me, 'What are you doing with your life? You really need to pack it in.'\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2021 Sam signed up to a year-long no-beer course and then quit alcohol completely. He's not had a drink now in three years and has even given up playing the concertina in pubs because it was so ingrained to have a drink at a session. When he does go to a pub he'll opt for a zero-alcohol drink.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he says it sometimes seems difficult for people to accept he's teetotal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's the odd person that you meet and you tell them you're not drinking and they kind of look at you sideways.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Unlike Sam, Jack's not keen on zero-alcohol drinks, and thinks they're \"a waste of time, because it's the same price as a pint\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He's thought about giving up drinking, but his inner resolve never lasts long.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Honestly, it's quite difficult to try and embark on the sober journey in Ireland - because it is intrinsically entwined into our culture,\" Jack says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I always kind of flirt with the idea of going totally sober - but then I instantly dissuade [myself] and have a pint.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c05f/live/d02f0df0-cc75-11f0-a892-01d657345866.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Temple Bar pub and street area in Dublin, Ireland, with people gathered outside\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC asked the Irish government why it had postponed the compulsory introduction of the new alcohol warning labels until 2028.
