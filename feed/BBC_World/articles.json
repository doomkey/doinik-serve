Iran blamed the US for turning peaceful protests into what it called \"violent subversive acts and widespread vandalism\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reacting to the latest developments, President Trump posted on social media: \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before.

Hundreds of protesters are believed to have been killed or injured, and many more detained. BBC Persian has confirmed the identities of 26, including six children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members of the security forces have also been killed, with one human rights group putting the number at 14. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC Persian has verified that 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht city on Friday night. The morgue there was at full capacity, so the bodies were taken away. The authorities asked the relatives of the dead for 7 billion rials (£5,222; $7,000) to release them for burial, a hospital source said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC and most other international news organisations are unable to report from inside Iran, and the country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A hospital worker in Tehran described \"very horrible scenes\", saying there were so many wounded that staff did not have time to perform CPR. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around 38 people died. Many as soon as they reached the emergency beds... direct shots to the heads of the young people, to their hearts as well. Many of them didn't even make it to the hospital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The number was so large that there wasn't enough space in the morgue; the bodies were placed on top of one another. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"After the morgue became full, they stacked them on top of one another in the prayer room,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The hospital worker said the dead or wounded were young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Couldn't look at many of them, they were 20-25 years old.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Protesters take to the streets of Tehran on Friday night</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor who contacted the BBC via a Starlink satellite connection on Friday night said Tehran's main eye specialist centre, Farabi Hospital, had gone into crisis mode with emergency services overwhelmed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Non-urgent admissions and surgeries were suspended and staff called in to deal with emergency cases, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's security forces often use shotguns which fire cartridges filled with pellets during confrontations with protesters. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'I saw one person who had been shot in the eye'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another doctor from the city of Kashan in central Iran told the BBC many injured protesters had been hit in the eyes, and that his colleagues in hospitals across the city reported receiving many wounded people during Friday night's unrest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thursday night produced similar accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A doctor at a medical centre in Tehran told the BBC: \"The number of injured people and fatalities was very high. I saw one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around midnight, the centre's doors were closed. A group of people broke the door and threw a man who had been shot inside, then left. But it was too late - he had died before reaching hospital and could not be saved.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC also obtained a video and audio message from a medic at a hospital in the south-west city of Shiraz on Thursday, who said large numbers of injured were being brought in, and the hospital did not have enough surgeons to cope with the influx. </p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Why are there huge protests going on in Iran?</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What footage is emerging from Iran shows protesters in Tehran taking to the streets en masse on Friday night, burning vehicles, and a government building set alight in Karaj, near the capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Iranian army has since said it will join security forces in defending public property.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It follows reports that Iranian security forces were spread thin as the unrest extended throughout the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian authorities issued a series of co-ordinated warnings to protesters on Friday, with the National Security Council saying \"decisive\" legal action would be taken against \"armed vandals\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iranian police maintained that no one was killed in Tehran on Friday night, though they said 26 buildings were set on fire, causing extensive damage.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An eyewitness who joined the protests on Thursday and Friday nights in Tehran told BBC Persian Television that Gen Z Iranians have been instrumental in encouraging their parents and older people to come out and join the protest marches, urging them not to be afraid.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday that Europe backed Iranians' mass protests and condemned the \"violent repression\" against demonstrators.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Friday the international body was very disturbed by the loss of life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz released a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to \"allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g49djqqjgo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">remained defiant in a televised address on Friday</a>, saying: \"The Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In later remarks broadcast on state television, Khamenei reiterated that his regime \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\" who he said were \"trying to please the president of the US\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the son of Iran's last shah, who was deposed by an Islamic revolution in 1979, described the protests as \"magnificent\" and urged Iranians to continue over the weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,\" Reza Pahlavi said in a social media video.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US-based Pahlavi also said he was preparing to return to the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But former UK ambassador to Iran Sir Simon Gass told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that \"we really shouldn't get too ahead of ourselves\" when discussing regime change. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said the lack of organised opposition within Iran meant people did not have an alternative figure to coalesce around as things stood.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, he noted the protests were \"a much wider movement\" than previous flare-ups, which were triggered by Iranians finding it \"almost impossible to make ends meet because of the disaster to the economy\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, President Trump reiterated his threat to Iran's leadership that the US would \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He clarified that this did not mean \"boots on the ground\". Last year, the US conducted air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, the US state department said accusations by Iran's foreign minister that Washington and Israel were fuelling the protests were a \"delusional attempt to deflect\" attention from the challenges the regime was facing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taghi Rahmani, an Iranian political activist who spent 14 years in prison and whose wife, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, was re-arrested in December, said any lasting change must come from Iranians instead of foreign intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The protests have been the most widespread since a 2022 uprising sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly.

Only the sense of someone setting off again,\" the post says, noting his hopes that his legacy and lengthy catalogue will live on.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post says he \"transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones\".</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him,\" the post continues. \"May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With a career spanning more than 60 years, Weir's big break was in 1965 with the founding of the Grateful Dead. Within a few years, they became a force within San Francisco's characteristic counterculture.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Quickly their style began shaping rock music - blending psychedelia and 1960s drug culture with musical tones that fused folk and Americana. They are considered one of the pioneers of jam bands.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Grammy's in 2007.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group officially halted in 1995 with the death of fellow co-founder Jerry Garcia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead &amp; Company, which had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in 2024 and 2025.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Weir was diagnosed with cancer in July and even while being treated, he continued to perform, according to the post on his page.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Those performances, emotional, soulful, and full of light, were not farewells, but gifts,\" the post says. \"Another act of resilience. An artist choosing, even then, to keep going by his own design.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He beat cancer before his death, the posts adds. It's unclear what type of cancer he had been diagnosed with.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His family, including wife Natascha and children Shala and Chloe, asked for privacy but said they appreciated the \"outpouring of love, support, and remembrance\".</p></div></div></body></html>"

What would it mean for the patients if the disease was never real?</b></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In early 2019, officials at a hospital in the small Canadian province of New Brunswick noticed that two patients had contracted an extremely rare brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, or CJD.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">CJD is both fatal and potentially contagious, so a group of experts was quickly assembled to investigate. Fortunately for New Brunswick, the disease didn't spread. But the story didn't end there. In fact, it was just beginning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the experts was Alier Marrero, a soft-spoken, Cuban-born neurologist who had been working in the province for about six years. Marrero would share some worrying information with the other members of the group. He had been seeing patients with unexplained CJD-like symptoms for several years, he said, including young people who showed signs of a rapidly progressing dementia. The number of cases was already more than 20, Marrero said, and several patients had already died.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because of the apparent similarity to CJD, Marrero had been reporting these cases to Canada's Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance System, or CJDSS. But the results had been coming back negative. Marrero was stumped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More worrying still, he was seeing a dizzying array of symptoms among the patients, according to his notes. There were cases of dementia, weight loss, unsteadiness, jerking movements and facial twitches. There were patients with spasms, visions, limb pain, muscle atrophy, dry skin and hair loss. Many said they were suffering with both insomnia and waking hallucinations. Patients reported excessive sweating and excessive drooling. Several exhibited Capgras Delusion, which causes someone to believe that a person close to them has been replaced by an identical-looking imposter. Others appeared to lose the ability to speak. One patient would report that she had forgotten how to write the letter Q.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero ordered test after test. But he was at a loss. \"I just kept seeing new patients, I kept documenting new cases, and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he recalled. \"And an image of a cluster became more clear.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Many of the cluster patients believe industrial poisoning has affected New Brunswick's environment. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Marrero and the CJDSS scientists began to suspect that instead of a small cluster of CJD patients, the province of New Brunswick might have on its hands a much larger cluster of people suffering from a completely unknown brain disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the next five years, Marrero's cluster would balloon from 20 to an astonishing 500. But there came no scientific breakthrough, no new understanding of neurology, no expensive new treatments. Instead, last year, a bombshell research paper authored by several Canadian neurologists and neuroscientists concluded that there was in fact no mystery disease, and that the patients had all likely suffered from previously known neurological, medical, or psychiatric conditions. The New Brunswick cluster was, one of the paper's authors told the BBC, a \"house of cards\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To report this story, the BBC spent time with Marrero and spoke to a dozen of his patients or their relatives — some of whom are telling their story for the first time — as well as key scientists, experts, and government officials, and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal emails and documents obtained by freedom of information requests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">We can reveal that at least one cluster patient has now opted for death via medical assistance in dying — legal in Canada since 2016. The diagnosis on the death certificate, according to the doctor who signed it off, was \"degenerative neurological condition of unknown cause\". At least one other cluster patient is currently considering assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The research paper published last year could have marked the end of a strange chapter in Canadian science. Except, hundreds of the patients disagree. Defiant, fiercely loyal to Marrero, and backed by passionate patient advocates, they argue that the paper is flawed and reject any notion that the cluster might not be real.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many believe instead that they have been poisoned by an industrial environmental toxin, and that the government of New Brunswick has conspired against them to cover it up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist type person, at all, but I honestly think it's financially motivated,\" said Jillian Lucas, one of the patients. \"There's all these different levels.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas first met Marrero back in early 2020, after her stepfather, Derek Cuthbertson, an accountant and military veteran, began experiencing cognitive and behavioural problems including sudden rage and loss of empathy. He was referred to Marrero, who ordered a battery of tests but was unable to explain his symptoms. Cuthbertson became one of the early cluster patients — the so-called \"original 48\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lucas had just gone through a divorce and suffered a bad concussion, and she moved back in with her mother and Cuthbertson in their rural community near the city of Moncton. Soon she began experiencing her own symptoms and went to see Marrero for herself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He ran so many tests, so much blood work and scans and spinal taps,\" Lucas recalled. \"We were trying to rule absolutely everything out and we just kept coming up with more questions.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Short on answers, Marrero added Lucas to the cluster. Over the coming months, her symptoms worsened and new symptoms appeared. She experienced light sensitivity, tremors, terrible migraines and issues with her memory and ability to speak clearly, she said. She felt unexplained stabbing pains. Cold water felt scalding hot.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas and her stepfather Derek Cuthbertson. Both were diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero, though, was attentive and caring. He took her symptoms seriously. \"He made me feel seen and that what I was experiencing was important,\" Lucas wrote in a Facebook post about her struggle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was a sentiment that seemed to be shared by everyone who saw Marrero. He held their hands during appointments. He remembered them, cried with them. He was \"the only one listening to them,\" said Lori-Ann Roness, one of the cluster patients.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an incredible human and physician,\" said Melissa Nicholson, whose mother died last year after being diagnosed with the mystery disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Watching our mom go through it was hard enough,\" Nicholson said. \"But he was such a pillar of support.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In March 2021, with Canada still in the grip of the Covid pandemic, the cluster suddenly became news. New Brunswick's chief medical officer had sent a memo to doctors alerting them to the apparent syndrome and suggesting they contact Marrero with possible cases. The memo leaked and the story hit the papers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero found himself inundated with new patients. But he was also drawing support from the highest levels of Canadian science. The working group set up to respond to the original CJD cases had evolved into a multi-disciplinary group studying the cluster, and the possibility of a mysterious new neurological condition seemed, at times, irresistible to the scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's like reading a movie script,\" emailed one researcher to colleagues, about an early story in the Toronto Star.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are all in the movie!\", a senior federal scientist replied.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero at home in New Brunswick. \"I kept documenting new cases and I kept seeing new people dying,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the heart of the working group was Marrero, along with Dr Michael Coulthart, the head of the CJD Surveillance System; Dr Neil Cashman, a leading Canadian neurologist; Dr Michael Strong, the head of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR); and Dr Samuel Weiss, one of the CIHR's senior neurologists. All agreed that Marrero needed considerable support. Strong said he could arrange additional staff and offered himself up as a consultant. The CIHR offered the province of New Brunswick C$5 million ($3.6m; £2.7m) to investigate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the mystery disease got a name: the \"New Brunswick Neurological Syndrome of Unknown Cause\". In an email to Marrero in April 2021, Strong called it \"one of the most unusual constellations of findings I have ever seen\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We all owe you a debt of gratitude,\" he wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But not everyone was on board. Dr Gerard Jansen, a neuropathologist who was attached to the CJD Surveillance System, had noticed something unusual when referrals from Marrero's office started piling up. Jansen recalled feeling \"flabbergasted\" at Marrero's notes, which he said featured an array of broad and unrelated clinical observations — a \"diarrhea of symptoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen saw clues in the patients' files that he said pointed to already defined neurological diseases. When he examined brain tissue samples of a few cluster patients who had died, he found signs of Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was alarmed. His superior, Coulthart, appeared to believe something unexplained was happening in New Brunswick, Jansen said. Keen to get his concerns down in writing, he sent Coulthart a long and detailed email.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"All available evidence and logic\" pointed to a collection of different diseases, Jansen wrote.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The patients are real, but the clustering as a mystery disease is not.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The early cases seemed to be grouped around two locations: Moncton and the Acadian Peninsula. Suspecting an environmental link, the scientists and officials considered various possible culprits, from a rare moose-borne parasite to blue-green algae blooms to Agent Orange sprayed on the province in the 1970s. Nothing bore fruit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero said he had observed an uptick in cases in late summer and early autumn — forestry spraying season — and he zeroed in on a controversial herbicide called glyphosate. Chronic exposure to glyphosate, which is used extensively by New Brunswick's forestry industry, has been linked by some studies to neuroinflammation and Parkinson's disease. (Forest NB, an industry body, told the BBC that glyphosate was used in compliance with regulations and was \"not expected to pose risks\" to human health or the environment.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Marrero, many of his patients were showing highly elevated levels of both glyphosate and various heavy metals. Though when asked by the BBC what proportion of his 500 or so patients had concerning results, he refused to say. \"I don't want to provide exact numbers of anything, but let's say it's an unusual number. Beyond 100.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By April 2021, the focus was firmly on a possible environmental toxin. Strong, the CIHR director, said he thought a full \"boots-on-the-ground\" investigation was needed. The same month, a specialist clinic — the Mind Clinic — was set up in New Brunswick with Marrero at the helm to treat the cluster patients. With the $5m on offer from the CIHR, and the backing of Strong and other top federal scientists, all the conditions appeared set to get to the bottom of the mystery.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But then, everything changed. In May, New Brunswick effectively suspended the collaboration with the federal scientists. The province also decided not to take up the $5m on offer from the CIHR. According to Marrero, the decision killed off any prospect of finding an answer. \"Everybody received that email like a cold shower,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of the provincial officials involved agreed to talk to the BBC on the record. But it is clear there was concern about Marrero's methods and about the nature of his contact with Coulthart, Strong and the other federal scientists. The view of some at senior levels of the New Brunswick government was that the informal working group, seduced by the possibility of a scientific mystery, was circumventing the province.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the decision to leave the money on the table, rather than spend it investigating, fuelled suspicions that New Brunswick wanted to avoid scrutiny of its environment. According to Kat Lanteigne, the executive director of Canadian health non-profit Bloodwatch and a tireless supporter of Marrero, the actions of the province amounted to a full-blown cover up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They pulled the plug because they just don't want anybody looking,\" Lanteigne said. \"Full stop.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Taking control of the process, New Brunswick mounted two investigations into the original cluster of 48 — one telephone questionnaire and one study of the patients' medical records by an oversight committee of six provincial neurologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jansen, the neuropathologist who had raised concerns, had by that point examined the autopsies of eight cluster patients and firmly believed they all had known, diagnosable illnesses. Troubled, he passed his conclusions on to the oversight committee and presented them to the Canadian Association of Neuropathologists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not long after that, the New Brunswick government finished its investigations, concluding in February 2022 that there was no common environmental cause and no common condition among the patients. In other words, no mystery disease.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">A protest sign in New Brunswick.

The patients — now 105 in number — were attending sporadic appointments with Marrero at the Mind Clinic but seeing little progress. Jillian Lucas's symptoms were worsening at such a rate that she had begun to weigh something once unthinkable to her: medically assisted dying.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At the clinic, appointments with Marrero could be strangely conspiratorial, patients said. During one appointment, Lucas's stepmother Susan recalled, Marrero put his hand up, told them to stop talking, and went to the door to listen. \"He said, 'I believe we are being recorded'.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stacie Quigley-Cormier, whose stepdaughter Gabrielle was the youngest member of the cluster, said Marrero always spoke in a hushed tone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The experience with Dr Marrero — and other patients talk about this too — is you make sure you start talking after the door is closed, and there's a quiet tone to his voice, and you make sure you're not talking in the hallways and things like that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero declined to discuss it. \"Some patients actually thought that way. And I… We wondered… But I don't want to comment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In August 2022, Marrero was sacked from the Mind Clinic. \"Despite our repeated attempts to inform you of our expectations and the deficiencies in your performance, you have not demonstrated a sustained ability to meet our expectations,\" wrote John Dornan, then-CEO of the health network. The 105 cluster patients each received their own letter, telling them they could stay at the clinic, with all the resources it had to offer, or strike out alone with Marrero.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Many were offended on behalf of their neurologist. \"When they called me to ask my choice, I said, it's not a choice, it's an ultimatum,\" Lucas said. \"And I choose him.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas at home with one of the family's 15 parrots. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She wasn't alone. Of the 105 patients, 94 chose Marrero. Just 11 people decided to stay with the clinic and get a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Outside of the clinic, increasingly isolated, Marrero continued to diagnose the mystery disease. He was sending patients for so many tests, for such obscure toxins or conditions, that some reported being met with an increasingly quizzical eye at the testing clinic, as if to say, \"What now?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others found it difficult to get an appointment with Marrero or even speak to his assistant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've messaged a couple of times but they're so busy, you can't even hardly get a hold of them by email,\" said Lucas. \"He just has so many patients.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the cluster generated more news coverage in Canada, little attention was paid to the 11 patients who had decided to stay with the Mind Clinic, and their stories have never been told.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kevin Strickland's partner April was referred to Marrero after she stopped her car in the middle of the road one morning and apparently forgot how to drive. April, then 60, had already been showing some dementia-like symptoms, but the driving incident scared Strickland. Marrero ran a series of tests on April and diagnosed the mystery illness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He told me it was the mystery illness and he wanted to look further into it, but he never really did much after that,\" Strickland said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Kevin Strickland at home with his rescue dog. His partner April was diagnosed by Marrero with the mystery illness. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The couple waited eight months to get important test results from Marrero, Strickland said, as April's condition worsened. Soon Strickland could no longer manage her care. But to get her a place in assisted living he needed a letter of support from Marrero. \"I think I waited four months for that letter,\" Strickland recalled. \"I kept phoning and asking.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Eventually he gave up and turned to the Mind Clinic, he said, and got the letter. And the Mind Clinic neurologists gave April something else she needed — a firm diagnosis. She was suffering from a form of frontotemporal dementia. In the end, Marrero \"did nothing for April,\" Strickland said. \"I guess he was more interested in proving the mystery illness than he was helping his patients,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sandi Partridge also chose to remain with the Mind Clinic. She felt a deep sense of loyalty to Marrero, but she also saw simple common sense in getting a second opinion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge had first seen Marrero in 2020, after suffering headaches and balance issues. He ordered a barrage of tests — according to Partridge she had two MRIs, two EEGs, a SPECT, a CAT scan and a spinal tap, as well as more than a dozen different antibody tests. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she recalled. \"Every time he would see me, it would be an hour and a half, sometimes two hours, and he would retest me every single time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But every test came back negative. Partridge had also provided Marrero with a video of her having a seizure at home, which he studied. He diagnosed her with the mystery illness. \"Those were the words he used,\" she said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Sandi Partridge in a park near her home. \"It was mostly a lot of testing with Dr Marrero,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One thing Marrero never mentioned to Partridge was functional neurological disorder, which was her eventual diagnosis. FND is a complex condition; previously known as psychosomatic or psychogenic illness, it describes physical symptoms with a psychological root. It presents a challenge to doctors, who have to guide patients through the stigma associated with it to an understanding that they have a real condition that requires complex treatment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge's neurologists at the Mind Clinic also reviewed the seizure video she had shown to Marrero. \"As soon as Dr Abdellah saw my seizure he said, that's FND,\" Partridge recalled. (Abdellah declined to speak to the BBC). Partridge threw herself into researching the condition. \"And I thought, that's me, that's me, that's me, that's me,\" she said. \"I hit every single marker.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Partridge is now on a multi-faceted FND treatment programme involving neurology, neuropsychology and occupational health. And she is at peace with her diagnosis. \"The stigma is difficult,\" she said, \"but I've accepted it.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gabrielle Cormier, the youngest patient in Marrero's cluster, would also receive a diagnosis of FND, but her journey would follow a different path.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier has featured heavily in the media coverage of the cluster, becoming a kind of poster child for the mystery disease. She was first referred to Marrero at just 18. A high school student, dancer and competitive figure skater, she had begun to experience fatigue-like symptoms and muscle soreness and then passed out at school.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier was already taking anti-anxiety medication, and the hospital emergency room doctor told her the incident was anxiety-induced. Unhappy with his assessment (he told Cormier, who is gay, that she \"just needed to find a boyfriend\", she said), the family looked to Marrero for answers.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier was diagnosed by Marrero at just 18. \"I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero was different — empathetic, caring. As he had with other patients, he ran Cormier through a gauntlet of tests. When nothing showed up, he diagnosed her with the mystery illness. Canada was deep in the isolation of the Covid lockdown, but Marrero reassured them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He said, there's a dozen other people at least that are experiencing similar things to what you're experiencing, and I don't have answers for it yet,\" stepmother Stacie Quigley-Cormier recalled. \"He told her that she wasn't alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There was one test Marrero couldn't secure: a PET scan, because the hard-up province was largely reserving them for cancer patients. So Cormier's parents took her to Toronto for the scan and a second opinion by a leading neurologist there, Dr Anthony Lang.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After a multi-day evaluation at a specialist neurology centre, Lang diagnosed Cormier with FND. Her tests showed that conscious movements were weak but forced reflex or automotive movements were normal and healthy. It pointed to psychology.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Quigley-Cormiers were initially prepared to accept the FND diagnosis, they said. But they left Toronto unhappy after Lang told them to stop treating Cormier as though she had a terminal illness because it was reinforcing her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A few weeks later, Lang called Cormier to inform her that a delayed test result had shown some reduced blood flow in her brain — something Marrero had also observed — and which can be caused by various medical or psychological issues including depression. Lang told Cormier the abnormality was slight and bore no relation to her symptoms, so she shouldn't worry about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call didn't sit well with the Quigley-Cormiers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There was no reason to call her personal phone when he knew she had memory problems,\" said her father Andre, angrily.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/bc5c/live/9cdddc70-ed44-11f0-8cc8-8329494b82ad.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Global News Jillian Lucas and other patients stand in front of a government building holding signs saying 'We are not a mystery, 'We stand by Doctor Marrero' and other slogans. \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Global News</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gabrielle Cormier, in her wheelchair, with other patients calling for suppport. Jillian Lucas is far left. (Global News)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The call pushed the Quigley-Cormier family away from Lang and his FND diagnosis and back towards Marrero, who the family had come to believe in deeply. Marrero had never crossed \"any kind of line,\" Stacie said. \"He's pristine.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why all his patients like him,\" Andre said. \"Love him, maybe.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero continued to test Cormier repeatedly. He prescribed anti-seizure medication to prevent possible seizures, though she had not had any. He referred her for a round of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment — which she said caused severe headaches, aches, nausea, dizziness and aseptic meningitis — and prescribed a powerful intravenous immunosuppressant used for blood cancers and autoimmune illnesses. Neither improved her condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cormier once dreamed of studying pathology. But her illness caused her to drop out of university and for years she has gone everywhere either in a wheelchair or with a cane, living, for a 24-year-old, a restricted life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've had this idea that my life has been wasted, or that I've done nothing with my life since I got sick,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So, yeah, it kind of feels like I've been robbed of that.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang, the Toronto neurologist, came away from his interaction with the Quigley-Cormier family troubled. His call to Cormier was not only appropriate, he said, he was ethically bound to communicate with her directly because she was a mentally competent adult who did not ask for her parents to act for her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the coming months, Lang watched with concern as the purported cluster ballooned in New Brunswick. He emailed Marrero and left messages with his secretary offering help, but never heard back. In late 2023, frustrated by what he saw as cluster misinformation everywhere, Lang decided with colleagues to mount a study. The results — published in May 2025 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA — landed in New Brunswick like a hand grenade.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lang and his co-authors — including several former Mind Clinic colleagues of Marrero and the concerned neuropathologist, Gerard Jansen — found that all 25 patients in their study had suffered from previously known conditions, from functional neurological disorder to dementia to cancer. The probability of there being no new disease was close to 100%, they said. The real cause of the cluster, they concluded, was serial misdiagnosis by Marrero, compounded by credulous media reporting, the limitations of New Brunswick's public health system, institutional distrust sown by the pandemic and the actions of a small group of people \"co-opting the crisis to suit their agenda\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Lang was the leading author on a paper casting doubt on the cluster. (Sammy Kogan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The cases in the JAMA paper consisted of 14 live patients and 11 autopsies. Most of the live patients were people who had chosen to remain at the Mind Clinic, like Sandi Partridge. A few, including Gabrielle Cormier, were included via a consent waiver — a legal process which allows researchers to use patient data without their express consent provided certain anonymity criteria are met.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The study's conclusions incensed the most vocal patients and patient advocates, including Kat Lanteigne and Stacie Quigley-Cormier, who allege that the research was unscientific and unethical. The Quigley-Cormiers are furious that Gabrielle's data was used for the study, and their lawyers have sent letters to Lang and to the journal alleging the paper was a violation of her privacy. JAMA declined to comment on the dispute. Lang said that the research was legal, ethical and appropriately anonymised. As for the alleged violation of privacy, he pointed out that the only reason anyone knew Cormier's data was used was because her father and stepmother had told the media, along with many other details about her life.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a bright morning this past September, Marrero was sitting in his home office in a large cottage-style house on a plot of land just outside of Moncton. A stone fountain burbled softly in his Japanese-inspired peace garden. Birds sang in his own patch of forest — untouched by herbicides or pesticides, he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Marrero is undeniably charismatic. He has a warm smile and demeanour. He speaks gently, but with authority. He remembers small details about people he barely knows and asks about their wellbeing in a manner that conveys genuine care.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Settled in his office chair, he recalled with obvious pleasure that not so long ago, some of Canada's top scientists had sat with him around that very desk, ready to take on a scientific mystery. But now, Marrero seemed increasingly isolated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are trying to present me as it,\" he said, dejectedly. \"I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Of Marrero's early federal collaborators — Drs Coulthart, Cashman, Strong, and Weiss — only Coulthart agreed to speak to the BBC about the cluster. He denied ever having been convinced by the idea of a unified, mystery syndrome. \"As a scientist, I use the word convinced very, very sparingly,\" he said. \"But don't let anybody kid you — if anyone says they know what's going on or isn't going on in New Brunswick, they're either lying or grossly mistaken. Because nobody has the facts.\"</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Marrero in his home office. \"I was part of it, but I was not it,\" he said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An upcoming provincial report could offer some answers. Unlike the previous studies, it will examine the claims of elevated glyphosate and heavy metals in the patients. At times, the stakes seem impossibly high. \"Lives hang in the balance,\" read a recent letter to Premier Susan Holt, signed by 72 of the patients. \"It is within your power to honour them, cherish them, and care for them,\" the letter said. \"Or you can abandon them and let them wither, fade, and ultimately die. Please join us on the right side of history.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The patient advocates, led by Bloodwatch director Kat Lanteigne, have arguably done more than anyone to keep the story of the cluster going, with an operation that includes lobbying the government, briefing the press and sending legal letters to scientists.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lanteigne has publicly attacked both Jansen and Lang over the JAMA study, branding their work inaccurate and unethical. She denied harassing Jansen, saying she had never spoken to him directly and emailed him only once. \"I have a record of speaking truth to power and I have always worked with integrity and honesty,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Both Lang and Jansen are standing their ground.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What we have here is a case of misdiagnosis, evolving to misinformation, and sadly resulting in suffering for patients and families,\" Lang said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I would even go further,\" Jansen said, regarding the alleged misdiagnosis of the patients. \"I would say they are being abused.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Few others are willing to criticise Marrero so openly. Privately, former senior government officials and colleagues of Marrero have questioned whether he should have been investigated. The Royal College of Physicians told the BBC it could not comment on whether there had been complaints against any individual physician, and none have been made public in relation to Marrero. Any sanction process would typically begin with a complaint.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And that was the issue, one former senior health official said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It has to be a patient complaint,\" they said. \"And all his patients love him.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The last time Jillian Lucas saw Marrero was more than a year ago. He tested her again, but she is yet to see the results. During the appointment, he told her that just getting a common cold could kill her, she said. So she rarely leaves the house — a cramped and densely cluttered property that the family shares with 15 parrots. \"She spends 90% of her time in her bedroom,\" her stepmother said. \"It's a very limited life.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kat Lanteigne told the BBC that Marrero \"deserves the Order of Canada for what he has done for these people.\" But many patients, like Lucas, are languishing. Largely untreated, they have undergone test after test in search of the mystery disease and ended up back where they began, or somewhere worse.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In response to criticisms in this story, Marrero said that he would not comment on patients or fellow physicians. \"The focus must remain on the hundreds of suffering patients, their families and communities who need to be the heart of our attention and care,\" he said.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Jillian Lucas in her back garden. \"I don't want to be in a nursing home, or be a burden,\" she said. (Chris Donovan/BBC)</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jillian Lucas has now seen a second doctor, but only because she has pushed ahead with her decision to explore medical assistance in dying, which requires two physicians to sign off. Canada has among the world's most permissive laws for assisted dying, allowing people to pursue it without a terminal diagnosis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Lucas told Marrero her plan, he became \"choked up\", she said. \"It eats him up, he's fighting back tears.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And yet, Marrero agreed to support her application, despite her not having a concrete diagnosis or testing positive for any known condition. (Marrero told the BBC he \"took the utmost care to abide by\" the laws around Maid and had \"never proposed it\" to a patient.) After all the years of uncertainty with the unknown neurological syndrome, the option of dying gave Lucas some sense of control. \"I have a limit in my mind of how far I can go,\" she said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sitting in his garden office, the sun streaming in, Marrero had no such limits in mind. \"I keep going because I know,\" he said, confidently. He had been able to meet \"with some of the best scientists in the country,\" he said. He had more than 500 cluster patients now, and every week the number was going up.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

No major financial commitments were immediately forthcoming.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has said he will unleash the South American nation's oil after US forces seized its leader Nicolas Maduro in a 3 January raid on its capital.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said in Friday's meeting at the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the oil bosses present expressed caution.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods said: \"We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Today it's uninvestable.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron is the last remaining major American oil firm still operating in the country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A handful of companies from other countries, including Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni, both of which were represented at the White House meeting, are also active.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: Mixed reactions among some Trump supporters to Venezuela operation</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The White House has said it is working to \"selectively\" roll back US sanctions that have restricted sales of Venezuelan oil. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Officials say they have been coordinating with interim authorities in the country, which is currently led by Maduro's former second-in-command, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they have also made clear they intend to exert control over the sales, as a way to maintain leverage over Rodríguez's government. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US this week has seized several oil tankers carrying sanctioned crude. American officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are open for business,\" Trump said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday, Trump signed an executive order that seeks to prohibit US courts from seizing revenue that the US collects from Venezuelan oil and holds in American Treasury accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Any court attempt to access those funds would interfere with US foreign relations and international goodwill, the executive order states.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump is preventing the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue that could undermine critical US efforts to ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the White House wrote in a fact sheet about the order. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's oil production has been hit in recent decades by disinvestment and mismanagement - as well as US sanctions. At roughly one million barrels per day, the country accounts for less than 1% of global supply.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Chevron, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's output, said it expected to bolster its production, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are ready to go to Venezuela,\" said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. \"In real estate terms, it is prime real estate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars,\" said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US state department special envoy for international energy affairs.</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfolded</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Exxon and Shell are \"not going to invest single-digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars\", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not really welcome from an industry point of view,\" he said. \"The conditions are just not right.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year, he said those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the \"fantastical\" $100bn figure that Trump has floated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact on production - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability. Americans should not expect the situation in Venezuela to lower oil prices anytime soon, he added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens,\" he said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-danielle-kaye\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Danielle Kaye</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

The White House recently said the administration was considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale.

Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She said she would never forget what she'd seen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors.  They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody.

A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the questions here are not just for the owners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74wexkd598o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They offered no explanation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Six Italians were killed as a result.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That includes for those with life-changing injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he's proud of how his team coped.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Add to that the anguish of surviving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It is a delicate moment.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019.

It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. </p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.</p></div></div></body></html>"

It comes after Trump said a military operation in Colombia \"sounds good\". Petro said that the US risks transforming from \"dominating the world\" to becoming \"isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He also accused US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents of acting like \"Nazi brigades\". Trump has significantly expanded ICE operations as part of what the administration says is a crackdown on crime and immigrants who illegally entered the US.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BBC has approached the White House for comment. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following US strikes on Venezuela and the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, US President Donald Trump said a military operation targeting Colombia \"sounds good\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has also repeatedly told Petro to \"watch his ass\", remarks Petro strongly condemned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and Petro spoke by phone on Wednesday evening, after which Trump said he <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98py70npj9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">would meet his Colombian counterpart at the White House in the \"near future</a>. Writing on his Truth Social platform late on Wednesday after the call, Trump described his conversation with Petro as a \"Great Honour\". A Colombian official said at the time that the conversation had reflected a 180-degree shift in rhetoric \"from both sides.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But on Thursday, Petro's tone suggested relations had not significantly improved.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He told the BBC the call lasted just under an hour, \"most of it occupied by me,\" and covered \"drug trafficking Colombia\" and Colombia's view on Venezuela and \"what is happening around Latin America regarding the United States.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro strongly criticised recent US immigration enforcement, accusing ICE agents of operating like \"Nazi brigades\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has accused countries like Colombia and Venezuela of not doing enough to tackle drug-trafficking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has conducted more than 30 strikes in recent months on vessels that the US says were being used for drug trafficking in the Caribbean and the Pacific, killing more than 110 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity in an interview that aired on Thursday night that after targeting drug trafficking by water \"we are going to start now hitting land\", adding that \"the cartels are running Mexico\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump has often blamed immigration for crime and trafficking in the US, using it to justify large-scale enforcement operations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since returning to the White House, the US president has sent ICE agents to cities across the country. The agency enforces immigration laws and conducts investigations into undocumented immigration. It also plays a role in removing undocumented immigrants from the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The administration says it<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp80ljjd5rwo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> deported 605,000 people between 20 January and 10 December 2025</a>. It also said 1.9 million immigrants had \"voluntarily self-deported\", following an aggressive public awareness campaign encouraging people to leave the country on their own to avoid arrest or detention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">About 65,000 people were in ICE detention as of 30 November 2025, according to data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse's immigration project, a compendium of government data from Syracuse University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This week a US immigration agent shot dead a 37-year-old US citizen in the city of Minneapolis, sparking protests overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Federal officials said the woman,<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jepdjy256o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> Renee Nicole Good</a>, had tried to run over immigration agents with her car but the city mayor, Democrat Jacob Frey, said the agent who shot her had acted recklessly and demanded agents leave the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said ICE had \"reached the point where it no longer only persecutes Latin Americans in the streets, which for us is an affront, but it also kills United States citizens.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that if this continued, \"instead of a United States dominating the world – an imperial dream – it is a United States isolated from the world. An empire was not built by being isolated from the world.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro said the US has for \"decades\" treated other governments, particularly in Latin America, as an \"empire\" regardless of the law.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two leaders have long been adversaries, frequently trading insults and tariff threats on social media. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Following the US's military action in Venezuela, Petro accused Washington of seeking wars over \"oil and coal,\" adding that if the US had not pulled out of the Paris Agreement, where countries agreed to limit global temperature rising by reducing fossil fuel use, \"there would be no wars, there would be a much more democratic and peaceful relationship with the world. And South America.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The Venezuelan issue is about this,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Trump's comments threatening military action in Colombia, demonstrations were held across the country in the name of sovereignty and democracy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro told the BBC that Trump's remarks amounted to a \"real threat\", citing Colombia's loss of territory such as Panama in the 20th century, and said \"the prospect of removing [the threat] depends on the ongoing conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked how Colombia would defend itself in the event of a US attack, Petro said he would \"prefer it to be about dialogue.\" He said that \"work is being done\" on this. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But he added: \"Colombia's history shows how it has responded to large armies.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not about confronting a large army with weapons we don't have. We don't even have anti-aircraft defenses. Instead, we rely on the masses, our mountains, and our jungles, as we always have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro confirmed he had also spoken to Delcy Rodríguez, Venezuela's acting president and former vice president and oil minister, and invited her to Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said Venezuela had \"long been subject to interference by various intelligence agencies,\" adding that while such agencies had permission to operate in Colombia, it was solely to combat drug trafficking. He denounced attempts at what he said were other \"covert operations\" in Colombia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He did not directly comment when asked whether he feared the CIA could carry out covert operations similar to their actions in Venezuela in Colombia, or whether he feared his own government or inner circles may have informants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro was captured by the US army's Delta Force, the military's top counter-terrorism unit, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmlz7r0zrxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">after a CIA source in Venezuelan government</a> helped the US track his location.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Gustavo Petro said Colombia preferred dialogue with the US, but added the country's history showed \"how it has responded to large armies\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the world's largest producer of cocaine, Colombia is a major hub for the global drug trade. It also has significant oil reserves, as well as gold, silver, emeralds, platinum and coal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has said it will control sales of Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking aboard Air Force One after the Venezuela operation, Trump described Petro as a \"sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States,\" adding: \"He's not going to be doing it for very long.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Petro denied the claims, saying it has \"always been proven that I'm not involved in that.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For 20 years I have been fighting against the drug cartels, at the cost of my family having to go into exile,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A former guerrilla, Petro has pursued a \"total peace\" strategy since taking office, prioritising dialogue with armed groups. Critics say the approach has been too soft, with cocaine production reaching record levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked what failed and whether he accepted responsibility, Petro said coca cultivation growth was slowing and described \"two simultaneous approaches.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"One, talking about peace with groups that are bandits. And the other, developing a military offensive against those who don't want peace.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said negotiations were ongoing in southern Colombia, \"where the greatest reduction in coca leaf cultivation has occurred\" and \"where the homicide rate in Colombia has fallen the most.\" Cocaine is made from the leaves of the coca plant. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The policy of dialogue, he said, was intended to \"de-escalate violence\", adding: \"we're not fools, we know who we're negotiating with.\"</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-68093155\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">US Politics Unspun</a> newsletter.

Today it's better known as the land of the Musang King — a buttery, bittersweet variety that the Chinese have dubbed the \"Hermès of durians\", as prized as the French fashion house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Raub is one of many South East Asian towns that sit at the heart of a global durian rush, pumped by China's growing demand. In 2024, China imported a record $7bn (£5.2bn) worth of durians — a three-fold increase from 2020. This is where more than 90% of the world's durian exports are now headed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Even if only 2% of Chinese people want to buy durians, that's more than enough business,\" says Chee Seng Wong, factory manager of Fresco Green, a durian exporter in Raub.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wong recalls how farmers cut down durian trees to make room for oil palms, the country's main cash crop, during an economic downturn in the 1990s.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Now it's the other way round.

It has been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-43940122\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">maligned for gas leaks</a>, and was <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46120507\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">the reason a plane was grounded</a> after passengers remonstrated against the smell wafting from the cargo hold.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Fans from the region have christened it the \"King of fruits\", but on the internet it has earned a less flattering tag — the world's smelliest fruit — as tourists unused to its odour seek it out with squeamish curiosity.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet it has found a growing fanbase in China: as an exotic gift exchanged among the affluent; a status symbol to be unboxed on social media; and the star of culinary heresies from durian chicken hotpot to durian pizza.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thailand and Vietnam are the top durian suppliers to China, accounting for nearly all of its imports. Malaysia's share of the market is sprouting fast, having earned a reputation with premium varieties such as the Musang King.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The average price of durian starts at less than $2 (£1.4) in South East Asia, where they are grown in abundance. But luxe versions like the Musang King could cost anywhere from $14 (£10) to $100 (£74) a pop, depending on their quality and the season's harvest. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once I ate Malaysian durian, my first thought was, 'Wow, this is delicious. I have to find a way to bring it to China',\" says Xu Xin, who has been sampling durians at a shop in Raub. The 33-year-old sells the fruit back home in northeastern China, and is on the hunt for the best durians to import.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8ab4/live/b6b1d0f0-ea08-11f0-b696-4d18e91c1002.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"BBC/Koh Ewe Side view of a middle-aged man in a white T-shirt holding a slice of durian in one hand and a yellow glob of durian in the other hand.

One of his earliest hits, Kadingo, was a song about personal hygiene.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His music, which features elements of reggae, Afrobeats and traditional Ugandan rhythms, gained a large following, and established him as a champion for social and political change.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his mounting fame, Bobi Wine chose to continue recording in a music studio he had built in the Kamwokya slum. He also worked as an actor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2016, many of the country's famous musicians backed President Museveni's re-election. Bobi Wine, however, held out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He released a song named Situka, in which he mused: \"When the going gets tough, the tough must get going, especially when leaders become misleaders and mentors become tormentors.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The following year, Bobi Wine turned his hand to politics.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He ran in a by-election for the Kyadondo-East constituency as an independent candidate, facing politicians from the ruling NRM and the FDC, which was Uganda's second-biggest party at the time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He won by a landslide, securing more than five times the total votes of his NRM opponent.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around this time, Bobi Wine developed the People Power movement, a pressure group campaigning for better democratic and social conditions. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Members began wearing red berets, which to this day remain a trademark for the opposition leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After Bobi Wine was repeatedly blocked from registering People Power as a political party, he joined the lesser-known, already-registered NURP. The party then changed its name to the NUP and Bobi Wine was chosen to be its leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">By 2021, he was ready to challenge Museveni in the presidential election.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the news of the ski resort fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And finally, this week - fury, when Crans-Montana's Mayor Nicolas Feraud revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crans-Montana sits in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Feraud and his colleagues, and are supposed to happen every 12 months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire. And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This was echoed by Romy Biner, mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: how well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And was there any possibility of corruption?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Absolutely not,\" was his indignant answer to the last question.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. \"We urgently need complete, transparent answers,\" she wrote on social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Elected officials in towns like Crans-Montana have many responsibilities as well as fire safety - running schools and social services, even collecting taxes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most of these officials work part-time and, once elected, continue with their day jobs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nowadays, some communes may be over-challenged trying to supply and oversee all the services a 21st-Century population expects, but Swiss voters expect better than what they heard from Feraud.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The headlines after his news conference were savage. Many demanded he and his colleagues resign. Feraud ruled this out, saying: \"We were elected by the people. You don't abandon ship in the middle of a storm.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A failure right across the board,\" wrote the broadsheet Tagesanzeiger. \"Now Switzerland's reputation is on the line.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"An utter disaster,\" wrote the tabloid Blick, \"a total failure of fire safety checks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Reputational damage is something the Swiss both hate and fear. Switzerland is a rich country, in part because of its reputation for safety, stability, reliability and, among its own citizens, accountability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If those in charge damage that reputation and put the country's success at risk, the Swiss are unforgiving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Heads rolled two decades ago when Swissair, the much-loved national airline, went bankrupt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Once nicknamed affectionately \"the flying bank\", Swissair's management had made a series of risky financial investments that left the airline dangerously over-extended.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In 2008, banking giant UBS, in which many Swiss, especially pensioners, had shares, had to be bailed out by Swiss taxpayers to prevent not just its own downfall, but disastrous consequences for the global economy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the bank's reckless over-exposure to subprime mortgages was revealed, there was outrage. At the bank's annual general meeting that year, normally sedate elderly shareholders hissed and booed. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One even jumped onto the stage, demanding the management give up their generous bonuses, ironically waving a string of Swiss bratwursts under their noses \"in case you go hungry\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Crans-Montana, too, has aroused that same angry feeling of trust being betrayed. But this is much worse than Swissair or UBS. Forty people, many of them teenagers, are dead. Dozens more have suffered life-changing injuries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Swiss authorities know there must be answers, quickly. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn7jxm7jkg1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Friday's memorial service</a>, the president of Valais, Matthias Reynard, was close to tears as he promised a \"strict and independent\" investigation, warning that \"relevant political authorities\" would be held accountable. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Switzerland's President Guy Parmelin said he expected justice \"without delay and without leniency\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The owner of the bar is now in custody, subject to a criminal investigation, but the role of the local government is sure to be examined, too. There are already calls for fire-safety inspection in Valais canton to be taken away from local town councils and given to canton authorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Romain Jourdan, a lawyer representing some of the families, has announced plans to file a case against Crans-Montana's town council. The families, he said, \"are demanding that all local officials be questioned so that such a tragedy never happens again\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is a deeper, nationwide soul-searching going on as well. The Swiss want to know why their beloved devolved system, which many, perhaps complacently, believed to be near-perfect, went so catastrophically wrong.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the first hours after the fire, many people, along with their shock and grief, felt a certain quiet pride that their emergency services had responded so quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Firefighters, ambulances crews and even helicopters were at the scene within minutes. The emergency services were present at the memorial service. Many openly wept.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shock and grief still sits deep, but the pride has evaporated. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What good are top-of-the-range, highly professional emergency services, the Swiss are asking themselves, if basic fire safety checks are neglected?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Switzerland's government says finding answers is a moral responsibility - to the families above all, but also to its own voters.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Ice and snow-capped mountains stretch as far as the eye can see, interrupted here and there by glittering fjords - all between the Arctic and the Atlantic Oceans. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is said to sit on top of the world; much of it above the Arctic Circle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland is nine times the size of the UK but it only has 57,000 inhabitants, most of them indigenous Inuit.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The scene on a snowy street in Nuuk, Greenland's capital city</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">You find the biggest cluster of Greenlanders on the south-western coast in the capital, Nuuk. We arrived there as a frozen twilight was creeping across snow-covered pedestrian streets. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Parents dragged their children home from school on sledges, and students mooched their way in and out of brightly-lit malls. Few wanted to talk to us about the Trump-related angst here. Those who did sounded very gloomy.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One pensioner banged his walking stick on the ground in emphasis as he told me the US must never plant its flag in Greenland's capital.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A lady who said she was mistrustful of everyone these days, and didn't give her name, admitted she was \"scared to death\" about the prospect of Trump taking the island by force after she watched his military intervention in Venezuela.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pilu Chemnitz (left) says Greenlanders \"just want to be left alone\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, 20-something pottery-maker Pilu Chemnitz said: \"I think we are all very tired of the US president. We have always lived a quiet and peaceful life here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course, the colonisation by Denmark caused a lot of trauma for many people but we just want to be left alone.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Never mind opposing a takeover by the US, which 85% of Greenlanders say they do, most also say they favour independence from Denmark - although many tell me they appreciate the Danish subsidies that help prop up their welfare state. While rich in untapped natural resources, poverty is a real issue here in Inuit communities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall, Greenlanders want a bigger, louder say, not only in their domestic policies, but in foreign affairs too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I went to the island's modest-looking parliament, the body of it built in a Scandinavian style with wooden slats and painted the same burnished red as the Greenlandic flags fluttering by the entrance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No security checks. All pretty relaxed. Except for the roaring polar bear emblem - a symbol of Greenland, etched onto every sliding glass doors we pass.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen hopes Marco Rubio's talks next week with Danish officials \"will end with understanding and compromise\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was there to meet Pipaluk Lynge-Rasmussen, co-chair of the foreign affairs committee in parliament. She is an MP with the pro-independence Inuit Ataqatigiit party that is part of the coalition government here.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think it's very important for us to speak out about what we want as a people,\" she told me. \"We have always worked towards independence when we got home rule in 1979 and more independence in 2009.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I asked Lynge-Rasmussen if she felt that big global powers - the US, Denmark, Nato, and the EU - were talking a lot about Greenland right now, rather than to the islanders about their fate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She nodded vigorously. Surprisingly, perhaps, she blames Denmark more than she blames Trump for overlooking Greenlanders' wants and needs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even though Greenland and the Faroe Islands are part of the Kingdom of Denmark, she says, she feels they have always been treated like second-class citizens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lynge-Rasmussen insisted that Greenlanders should not see themselves as victims in the current situation. Instead, she suggests they use the international spotlight now on them to show off their importance and push for their priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What of the meeting next week with Rubio, I asked?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I hope the meeting will end with understanding and compromise,\" she answered.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Maybe doing business with [the US] from here… maybe co-operating on trade, or mining, having more American [military] bases on Greenland, perhaps?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under a bilateral agreement with Denmark dating back to 1951 the US may bring as many US troops as it wants to Greenland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This has left European allies wondering out loud why Trump feels the need to \"take\" the island unilaterally: whether buying it - seemingly Washington's preferred option, or encouraging Greenlanders to vote in a plebiscite to become part of the US, or taking Greenland by force, something the Trump administration has refused to rule out.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It wouldn't take much flexing of military muscles. Greenland has few trained soldiers and no military bases of its own.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance justify their need to \"take\" Greenland because they say Denmark doesn't do enough to secure the island. Copenhagen disputes this.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's also worth noting that the US already has a military base on Greenland - and it chose to radically reduce its presence there from about 10,000 personnel during peak Cold War times to some 200 now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has long taken its eye off Arctic security, until recently.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's keen interest in the island is likely a mix of:</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">perceived national security concerns</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">a hunger for the rich natural resources Greenland boasts, including rare earths and minerals</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\"> and his loudly-trumpeted desire to dominate the Americas.</li></ul></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Snow-covered houses in Nuuk at nighttime</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Geographically Greenland is part of North America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's closer to New York City by about 1,000 miles (1,609 km) than to Copenhagen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This should give Greenlanders pause for thought, opposition MP Pele Broberg of the Naleraq Party told me.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He said people were scared of what Trump would do to Greenland because they were misinformed, largely because of media hysteria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's true, we are not for sale - but we are open for business. Or we should be.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Right now we are a colony. We are made to import our goods from Denmark: 4,000km away, rather than from the US which is much closer.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Broberg described his organisation as the island's true independence party, pushing he says for freedom, so Greenlanders can trade, on their terms, with any party or country they choose: the US, Denmark or others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But right now, the US is making demands, rather than business deals between equals.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what exactly are the national security priorities Trump sees in Greenland?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Briefly put: the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach continental US is via Greenland and the North Pole.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Washington DC already has an early warning air base on the island - but Greenland could serve as a base for missile interceptors as part of the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" system: a plan to shield the US from all missile attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has also reportedly discussed placing radars in waters connecting Greenland, Iceland and the UK - the so-called GIUK Gap. That's a gateway for Chinese and Russian vessels that Washington wants to track.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no evidence to the naked eye when you are in Greenland to back Trump's recent assertions that there are lots of Chinese and Russian ships currently around the island. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And last week Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticised Washington for \"using the so-called 'China threat' as a pretext for itself to seek selfish gains\" in the Arctic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Russia and China have been expanding their military capabilities, and have beefed up their co-operation elsewhere in the region - with joint naval patrols and co-developing new shipping routes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Under pressure from western sanctions over Ukraine, Moscow is keen to ship more to Asia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Beijing is looking for shorter, more lucrative maritime routes to Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The northern sea route is becoming easier to navigate due to melting ice, and Greenland opened its representation office in Beijing in 2023 in pursuit of deeper ties with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When it comes to Arctic security, Nato allies hope to persuade Washington that they are serious. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reportedly spoke more than once to the US president last week, telling him that Europe will step up its presence even further in the region. He's also been urging European leaders to increase their cooperation with the US there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Greenland, Denmark and their Nato allies believe there is room for negotiation with Rubio next week and that, at the very least, Trump swooping in to Greenland militarily is unlikely - though not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But if the Trump administration does choose that option, it's hard to know what Europe could or would do about it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The continent still heavily relies on the US for its own security and defence, and its leaders also desperately want to keep Washington onside in talks to end the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Arctic powers geographically are Denmark, the US, Canada, Russia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. An Arctic Council, representing them all, has long tried to maintain the mantra: high north, low tension.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But military chest-beating and unilateralism from Washington over Greenland, plus a wider scramble for advantage between global superpowers, adds to a real sense of jeopardy in the region.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The decades-long delicate balance in the Arctic, in place since the end of the Cold War, and even managed since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, could be dangerously upset.</p></div><figure></figure></article></div></body></html>"

Increasingly that includes decisions about relationships and parenthood – and these choices are, in turn, shaping the future of a country in which both marriage and birth rates are falling.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Millions of Ukrainian women who left at the start of the 2022 full-scale invasion have now built lives and relationships abroad. Hundreds of thousands of men are absent too, either deployed in the army or living outside the country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For those women who stayed, the prospect of meeting somebody to start a family feels increasingly remote.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Khrystyna, 28, says it's noticeable that there are fewer men around. She lives in the western city of Lviv and has been trying to meet a partner through dating apps without much luck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Many, I would say most [men] are afraid to go out now, in this situation,\" she says, raising her eyebrows. She is referring to the men of fighting age who spend most of their time indoors to avoid the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz994d6vqe5o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">conscription squads roaming the streets of Ukraine's cities</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As for soldiers, \"many are traumatised now because most of them – if they have returned – were in places where they experienced a lot\", she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Daria feels much the same. \"I only see three options here,\" she says, listing the types of men she believes are available to women like her.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">First are those trying to avoid conscription. Someone who can't leave the house is probably \"not a person you want to build a relationship with\", Daria says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Then there are soldiers, forced into long-distance relationships with sporadic visits from the front line. With them, Daria warns, \"you build a connection, then he leaves\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The remaining option, she adds, are men under the conscription age of 25. But those aged 22 and under can still leave the country freely, and Daria says they could take off at any moment.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of these appeal to her.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b246/live/a555d7e0-eca9-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Supplied A man, in military uniform, drives a car\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Supplied</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Drone operator Denys says the war makes it difficult to promise long-term plans to a partner</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Closer to the front line, many men on active duty are also shelving the idea of starting a relationship. Uncertainty, they say, makes long-term commitments feel irresponsible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ruslan, a soldier serving in the Kharkiv region, knows the promises he can make are limited. Beyond visits once or twice a year, flower deliveries and the odd phone call, he asks, \"what can I actually offer a girl right now?\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Promising a wife or a fiancée any long-term plans is difficult,\" says Denys, a 31-year-old drone operator, in a voice message sent from his position in the east of the country. \"Every day there is a risk of being killed or injured, and then all plans will, so to speak, go nowhere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The consequences of this disruption threaten to ripple far into Ukraine's future. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In many ways, they already have. Since the start of the invasion, the number of marriages has decreased sharply from 223,000 in 2022 to 150,000 in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine has also seen deaths increase, enormous emigration – more than six million people have left the country since 2022, according to an UN estimate – and a stark decline in birth rates. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These all lead to a dramatic drop in population, which in turn shrinks the workforce and slows economic growth.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Oleksandr Hladun, a demographer at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences, describes these trends as the \"social catastrophe of war\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And this follows Ukraine's population declining between 1992 and 2022, from 52 million to 41 million, due to a high mortality rate, migration and a decline in birth rates.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Birth rates have dropped even lower during the conflict. In 2022, numbers were partly sustained by pregnancies from 2021, Hladun told Ukrainian media earlier this year. In 2023, some couples had children in the hope the war would end.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in 2024, when it became clear peace was not imminent, the birth rate fell sharply. It now stands at 0.9 children per woman, a record low, and far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the population (for comparison, the total fertility rate in the EU is 1.38).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While a decline in births is to be expected during war, Hladun says, it is generally followed by a peacetime compensatory increase thanks to those who postponed having children. But this effect is limited, usually lasting up to five years – too short a time to have a significant effect on Ukraine's bleak long-term prospects.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The longer a war lasts, the smaller this compensatory effect becomes,\" Hladun adds, because couples who put off having children during the conflict no longer get the chance to do so. \"And for us it has already been four years, which is quite a long period.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the National Academy of Sciences, the effects of the war will last well beyond the end of hostilities – which, in any case, is not in sight. The result, it says, could be a population of 25.2 million people by 2051, less than half what it was in 1992.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even committed couples suffer from the uncertainty of war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olena, 33, has come to a fertility clinic on the outskirts of Lviv for a check-up. She is a policewoman and military instructor who is currently freezing her eggs, as health issues have made it difficult for her and her husband to conceive. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At some point, Olena says, they will try IVF – though only while \"taking into account my work and the situation in the country\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Dr Liubov Mykhailyshyn, right, is worried that the war is affecting the fertility of young Ukrainian couples</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Olena remembers life before the war as beautiful and \"full of hope\". But her dreams of starting a family were put on hold by the start of the invasion in 2022.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"During the first year of the war, it felt as if everything had stopped,\" she says. \"Everything we were striving for – building a home, planning children – nothing mattered anymore.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Those fears haven't disappeared, even in Lviv, which like other parts of western Ukraine has, comparatively, been spared the worst of Russia's attacks. But for Olena, the question of having children now carries a sense of duty. \"I am doing this both for myself, and for my family, and for Ukraine,\" she says. Soldiers on the front line, she believes, also die for the sake of unborn Ukrainian children.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other side of the desk, Olena's gynaecologist and clinic director Dr Liubov Mykhailyshyn listens.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She is proud to help \"strong, nice women\" like Olena, she says. But her big concern is the way the war is affecting the fertility of young Ukrainians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She worries about years of chronic stress and sleepless nights  – as well as the additional physical and psychological trauma for those on the front line. All of these, she says, can cause fertility problems, which could have an impact on birth rates in the years to come.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We are waiting for it,\" Mykhailyshyn says of the demographic crisis ahead. Olena nods.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recently, the Ukrainian government developed strategies aimed at tackling the problem, including affordable childcare and housing. These policies, however, rely on local authorities rather than centralised funding – meaning projects often don't take off, according to Hladun.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as long as would-be mothers and children remain exposed to the dangers of war, state-level efforts might not find much success, he concedes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine now has 17 million fewer people than when it gained independence after the fall of the Soviet Union. Only a return of a substantial proportion of the 6.5 million Ukrainians who live abroad could boost figures quickly.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet even when the fighting stops, it is unclear how many will come back.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">People will be more willing to return if Ukraine is able to regain most of the territory seized by Russia since 2014, Hladun suggests. But anything short of that could leave Ukrainians feeling vulnerable as it would be considered a temporary ceasefire rather than a complete end of hostilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite insistence from Moscow that it does not wish to take over the whole of Ukraine, many Ukrainians are convinced that Russia poses an existential risk to their country – and one that will outlast Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In this context, Ukraine's population decline should be seen as a security threat, says Hladun. \"Russia is simply demographically much larger,\" he argues. \"And in this sense, it has more resources for war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The longer the war continues, the more the uncertainty will dent the country's prospects for long-term recovery. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Planning a future feels fragile, almost naive,\" Daria says. \"This uncertainty is painful, but it becomes a part of everyday life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I've come to accept that I might stay alone not because I want to, but because war reshapes what feels possible,\" she adds. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Learning to live with that is, in itself, a form of survival.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-liubov-sholudko.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Liubov Sholudko.</i></p></div></article></div></body></html>"

I now reach for my phone less and mainly use it when I genuinely need to do something.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'It hasn't really changed anything'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amy's experience is likely to put a smile on the face of Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who in the lead-up to the ban pleaded with kids to kick their social media habits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The government has cited online bullying and protecting young people from online predators and harmful content as some of the reasons for the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since 10 December, tech companies risk being fined up to A$49.5m (US$32m, £25m) if they don't take \"reasonable steps\" to boot under-16s off their platforms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Albanese's hopes that the ban would usher in a new generation of sports-loving, book-reading, instrument-playing kids may have fallen flat for many.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aahil, 13, hasn't read more books, played more sports or started learning an instrument.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he spends about two and a half hours on various social media platforms every day – the same as before the ban started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He still has his YouTube and Snapchat accounts – both use fake birthdays - and spends most of his time on gaming platform Roblox and Discord, a messaging platform popular with gamers – neither of which are banned.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It hasn't really changed anything,\" Aahil says, as most of his friends still have active social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But his mum Mau has noticed a change.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/441a/live/42a0da50-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Supplied A young boy, with his arms crossed, floating on a inflatable orange ring in a pool with greenery and a waterfall in the background \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Supplied</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Aahil, 13, spends more than two hours a day on social media, mainly playing games.</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's moodier,\" she says, adding he spends more time playing video games than before.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When he was on social media, he was more social … more talkative with us,\" Mau says, though, she adds, his moodiness may also simply be the \"teenage years\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Consumer psychologist Christina Anthony says moods might be due to the ban's short-term effects on emotion regulation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For many teenagers, social media isn't just entertainment - it's a tool for managing boredom, stress, and social anxiety, and for seeking reassurance or connection,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When access is disrupted, some young people may initially experience irritability, restlessness, or a sense of social disconnection… not because the platform itself is essential, but because a familiar coping mechanism has been removed.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over time, young people may adopt new coping strategies such as talking to trusted adults, she adds.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Snapchat's out, WhatsApp's in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In another Sydney household, the ban has had little impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"My usage of social media is the same as prior to the ban because I made new accounts for both TikTok and Instagram with ages above 16 years old,\" says 15-year-old Lulu.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The new law has influenced her in other ways.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I am reading a bit more because I don't want to be on social media as much.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she's not spending more times outdoors, nor is she arranging to meet friends face-to-face.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, Lulu, along with Amy and Aahil, all started using WhatsApp and Facebook's Messenger more – neither are banned - because they couldn't contact friends who had lost access to their social media accounts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This, Anthony says, goes to the heart of why social media is fun and engaging in the first place: it's social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The enjoyment doesn't come from scrolling alone, but from shared attention,\" she says, \"knowing that friends are seeing the same posts, reacting to them, and participating in the same conversations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When that \"emotional lift\" fades, the platform begins to feel \"oddly unsocial\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That's why some young people disengage even if they technically still have access…without peers present, both the social feedback and the mood payoff drop sharply.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Kids flock to apps as FOMO sets in</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Seeking lookalike apps to fill the void was exactly what thousands of Australians did in the days before the ban started, with three little-known apps - Lemon8, Yope and Coverstar - surging in downloads.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This attraction to alternative photo and video-sharing platforms fits into what's known as compensatory behaviour, Anthony says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When a familiar and emotionally rewarding activity is restricted, people don't simply stop seeking that reward… they look for alternative ways to get it,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For teens, that often means compensating with platforms or activities that provide similar psychological benefits: social connection, identity expression, entertainment, or escapism.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That initial rise has now dropped but daily downloads are still higher than usual, says Adam Blacker from Apptopia, a US-based company which tracks consumer trends of mobile apps.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fall in downloads suggested \"a chunk of kids might be embracing the new rules and swapping their time spent on mobile for time spent elsewhere,\" Blacker says.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Amy was one of the thousands who downloaded Lemon8 - created by the makers behind TikTok - before the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This was largely influenced by social pressure and a fear of missing out as many people around me were doing the same,\" she says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she has never used it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Since then, my interest in social media has decreased significantly, and I don't feel any need to download or use alternative platforms.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of Australians downloading virtual private networks – or VPNs – also increased before the ban, but has since fallen back to normal levels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">VPN technology allows users to hide their location and pretend they are based in another country, in effect, bypassing local laws.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But they have limited appeal to teens, Blacker says, because many social media platforms can detect VPNs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Teens can only leverage VPNs to create a new account,\" he says, so \"they would be starting over in terms of connections, settings, photos and more\".</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Gaming 'much harder to get into'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the months before the ban, debate swirled around the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w90kqgv9o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">exclusion of gaming platforms</a>, with critics concerned that many youngsters use them in the same way as social media, meaning they presented the same types of potential harms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While there's no evidence yet on whether more teenagers have switched to the likes of Roblox, Discord and Minecraft to socialise, it's a real possibility, says Mark Johnson, an expert in gaming live stream platforms such as Twitch, which is part of the ban.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But that's also contingent on a young person having the required hardware, the required cultural and technical knowledge, and so forth - games are much harder to get into, for the uninitiated, than social media sites,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Johnson, who lectures in digital cultures at the University of Sydney, says the reaction to the ban has been mixed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"A lot of parents seem to be reassured and pleased that their children and teenagers are spending far less time in social media,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Equally, some are lamenting the newfound difficulty their young people are having in communicating with their friends, and in some cases with family members who live elsewhere.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A spokesperson for the eSafety Commissioner says they will release their findings on how the ban is going - including the number of accounts that have been deactivated since 10 December - in the coming weeks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Communications Minister Anika Wells says the ban is \"making a real difference\" and leaders across the globe are looking to mirror the Australian model.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Delaying access to social media is giving young Australians three more years to build their community and identity offline, starting with spending more time with family and friends over the summer holidays,\" the spokesperson says.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Time will tell</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b260/live/e4aac950-ec1d-11f0-bc41-9b7ff40f2244.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Supplied A partial hand, holding a pen, poised over an open page of an empty diary.

The first was called \"Mosi\", which means \"smoke\" in South Africa's Tswana language, and took place in 2019 with little fanfare.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But by the time Mosi II took place in 2023, Russia had launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65787544\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">and the timing of the exercise was heavily criticised</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It fell straight over the first-year anniversary of the Russian invasion,\" says Wingrin. \"So it raised eyebrows because of the timing.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The current exercise was initially scheduled to take place in November last year and was going to be called Mosi III. But it was postponed because of the G20 leaders' summit that South Africa hosted for the first time - and has been subject to a name change and the invitation broadened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Around the middle of last year, we started hearing that it was no longer called Mosi III, but that it was now going to be a Brics+ maritime exercise called 'Will for Peace',\" Wingrin says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in the current political climate this expansion could further alienate South Africa from the US, one of its main trading partners.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"South Africa has been under pressure since the Trump administration came back into power. And even before that, when the Democrats were in power, they also perceived South Africa as anti-American,\" William Gumede, a professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And the fallout with the Trump administration has been spectacular. He accused the South African authorities of failing to protect its white minority population and offered Afrikaners (who are mainly descended from Dutch settlers), refugee status in the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He then imposed higher tariffs and removed aid to South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">His anger was also partly fuelled by Pretoria's role <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67922346\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">in bringing a case against Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICJ)</a>. The US ally has strongly rejected the allegation of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza as \"baseless\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But overtures by Pretoria and South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa's visit in May to the White House, with a delegation that included famous white South African golf players, failed to mend fences. Instead Ramaphosa was ambushed in the Oval Office <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce9vvljen0xo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">with a series of contested claims about the killings of white farmers in South Africa</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">None of South Africa's political parties have said that there is a white genocide in the country. That includes parties that represent Afrikaners and the white community in general.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Yet Trump repeated such claims when he decided to boycott November's G20 summit, which was held in Johannesburg, saying it was a \"total disgrace\" that Africa's largest economy was hosting it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Afrikaners are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated,\" he posted on his social media platform Truth Social.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gumede points out that the South African economy, which has been struggling for years, needs access to the US market.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We cannot afford to alienate the US. If we add the contribution of the US state, the American private sector as well as US civil society to the South African economy, it is much higher than China's,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"US companies in South Africa alone produce more than 500,000 jobs. If you look at all the Chinese companies in South Africa, saying they create 10,000 jobs, or even 20,000 jobs, would be a generous estimate.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This differs from government figures released in 2024, which said China had created around 400,000 jobs in South Africa.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think the US is much more strategic to us in real terms than China,\" Gumede says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last year the central bank warned that the US's new 30% tariffs on South African exports could lead to around 100,000 job losses, with the agriculture and automotive sectors hardest-hit.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Gumede explained that the African National Congress (ANC), the party that brought liberation to South Africa in 1994, sees China as an ideological partner. Russia too is respected for its role in supporting the ANC's struggle against the apartheid regime and white-minority rule.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the ANC has failed to update its foreign policy to encompass its new coalition partners after losing its parliamentary majority in 2024, he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was forced to enter a governing coalition including parties such as the pro-business, Western-aligned Democratic Alliance (DA).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"When it was a majority party, China was a strategic partner for the ANC government. But now we are in a government of national unity, so what we should have done, as a country and as a government, is to come up with a new foreign policy which is inclusive of the ANC's partners, because the ANC is not a majority partner any more.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/adfa/live/0c499fe0-ed9f-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"SA National Defence Force South African army and naval officers pictured in Simon's Town harbour with ships behind them\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">SA National Defence Force</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">One South African official said the war games were a good training opportunity for its defence forces and would boost morale </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The DA, the second largest party in the country, has heavily criticised the Will for Peace naval exercise.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement, its defence spokesperson Chris Hattingh said it undermined South Africa's non-aligned foreign policy stance.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This exercise is being led by China and includes participation by Russia and Iran, both heavily sanctioned and both involved in active conflicts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Hosting and training with such forces cannot be described as neutral or non-aligned. It is a political choice, whether the government admits it or not.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Wingrin says there may also have been practical considerations behind the South African military's decision to go ahead.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"South Africa is in a difficult position because years of defunding the defence force and of cutting its budget has left our defence capabilities decimated,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We don't have as many ships capable of going to sea to go to other countries to exercise. So we have to take every opportunity we can to exercise with any country that's willing to come to South Africa.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">South Africa deputy Defence Minister Bantu Holomisa has also shrugged off the criticism, saying it is an honour for the country's defence forces \"to practise with well-equipped countries in military terms\" and it will boost the morale of troops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, Wingrin warns it could spell trouble: \"I don't believe this exercise will result in any military action from any other country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"But it may certainly make South African trade negotiations more difficult with certain countries. It's not the exercise per se, it's all about the optics.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A view echoed by other commentators, like Gumede: \"This definitely will be seen as a provocation by the Trump administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is not a good look for South Africa given the current geopolitics.

The US Space Command, which operates satellites, also received credit for creating a \"pathway\" for the special forces to enter unseen.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Stealth drones were also thought to have been deployed.

One helicopter was hit but was still able to fly and no US forces were killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are still few details about the battle that took place at Maduro's compound, Fuerte Tiuna. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Cuban government said that 32 of its nationals were killed by US forces. These were bodyguards provided to defend Maduro by its ally, Cuba. The Caribbean country provides not just bodyguards, but wider security support to the regime. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Within the immediate perimeter of Maduro, there were probably zero Venezuelan security officers and on the outer perimeter maybe a mixture of both,\" says Fitzgerald. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The fact that they proved so ineffective has also led to questions about whether some elements of the regime facilitated the mission in some way. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US forces were also able to get to Maduro as he was trying to lock himself into a steel safe room but before he could close the door. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They had blowtorches and explosives ready to blow the door open if needed, but the speed of the apprehension again suggests an incredibly detailed understanding of the layout of the compound.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e504/live/f2b54b20-ed66-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"CBS Charred, burnt out cars in what looks to have been a car park\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">CBS</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fuerte Tiuna, Venezuela's largest military complex, was hit by US strikes as part of the operation</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">The plan</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The CIA undertook a classified assessment in advance of the operation, looking at what might happen if Maduro was removed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The analysts examined a series of options and, according to reports, came to the view that working with elements of the existing regime offered more chance for stability than trying to install the opposition in exile in power.

And it'll be extremely expensive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca64/live/80850430-ec82-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz (L) speaks with US President Donald Trump \n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Friedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'A popular revolt against the establishment'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"European nations are going to have to <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5yq5zdv907o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">spend much more on their own defence.</a> This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money.
