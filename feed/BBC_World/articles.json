He added that it would \"only get bigger\" and \"be like nothing they have ever seen before\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also accused Maduro's government of using \"stolen\" oil to \"finance themselves, Drug Terrorism, Human Trafficking, Murder, and Kidnapping\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The president has repeatedly accused Venezuela of drug smuggling, and since September the US military has killed at least 90 people with its strikes on boats that were allegedly carrying fentanyl and other illegal drugs to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, it has provided no public evidence that these vessels were carrying drugs, be it fentanyl - which is mainly produced in Mexico - or cocaine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Tuesday's post from Trump suggested that a label that the US had previously applied only to Maduro was now being widened to his whole government.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Last month, the US formally alleged that the Venezuelan Cartel de los Soles group was an FTO. The designation meant that Maduro was effectively designated as terrorist as well, because he was alleged to be group's leader - which he denies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump's post did not give further detail of how the wide-ranging blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would be enforced.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">After seizing the tanker last week, the US went on to impose fresh sanctions on six more ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's economy is heavily dependent on oil exports, even though the amount of oil it actually produces is relatively small given that the country is home to the world's largest proven reserves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When announcing the tanker seizure off Venezuela's coast last week, the White House said the vessel in question, called the Skipper, had been involved in \"illicit oil shipping\" and would be taken to a US port. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Venezuela's government decried the move, with Maduro saying the US \"kidnapped the crew\" and \"stole\" the ship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US had been building up its military presence in the Caribbean Sea, which borders Venezuela to the north, in the weeks and months before the raid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The build-up has involved thousands of troops and the USS Gerald Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – being positioned within striking distance of Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Congressman Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing Texas, said Trump's \"naval blockade is unquestionably an act of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He added that US lawmakers would on Thursday vote on a resolution \"directing the president to end hostilities with Venezuela\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US, under both Trump and former President Joe Biden, has opposed the Maduro government for years and pressed for him to be removed by imposing stringent sanctions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Maduro's government has been accused of rights abuses by the wider international community for many years. Venezuela's opposition, as well as many nations including the US, denounced last year's election as rigged and say his rule is therefore illegitimate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday, the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, warned that the country's \"crackdown on civic space has intensified, suffocating people's freedoms\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"></p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p></article></div></body></html>"

The slanted-eyes pose is often seen as disrespectful to East Asians.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The post drew backlash in Japan, South Korea and China against the 22-year-old and even against her country's flag carrier, Finnair.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Even Finland's prime minister weighed in on Monday, saying that making such gestures was \"thoughtless and stupid\" and that the controversy that ensued was \"damaging\" to the country.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Dzafce claimed the gesture was her reaction to a headache during dinner. She said a friend added the offensive caption to the 11 December post without her consent, according to local tabloid Ilta-Sanomat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ms Dzafce has apologised for the photo, noting it has \"caused ill will in many people\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was not my intention in any way...

Nothing, zero, nothing\". </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Among the other figures that Wiles commented on was JD Vance, a one-time critic of Trump who has since become a close ally and vice-president. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles suggested that Vance's shift in perceptions was \"sort of political\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters at an event on Tuesday, Vance said he had not read the article, but that he only believes in conspiracy theories that are \"true\" - citing reports of former President Joe Biden's ill-health as an example. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her strongest comments were reserved for tech billionaire Elon Musk, who led cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Government Efficiency - or Doge - before leaving the government in May.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Shortly thereafter, Musk and Trump had a public spat that saw the two men trade barbs and insults over social media.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Wiles described Musk as an \"avowed Ketamine [user]\" who \"sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB\", the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"He's an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are,\" she said. \"You know, it's not helpful, but he is his own person.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Looking back on Musk's cost-cutting efforts, Wiles said that she was against the gutting of the US Agency for International Development, or USAID, saying she was \"initially aghast\" at the idea. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I think that anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she recalled. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"With that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On Tuesday morning - hours after the Vanity Fair article was published - Wiles took to X, accusing the magazine of a \"disingenuously framed hit piece\" aimed at her, Trump and other cabinet members. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When contacted for comment on the story, the White House also defended Wiles. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement sent to the BBC, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt added. \"The entire administration is grateful to her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking to reporters outside the West Wing later in the day, Leavitt accused Vanity Fair of \"bias of omission\" by excluding other interviews conducted with White House staff and taking Wiles' words \"wildly out of context\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Musk has yet to comment on the Vanity Fair piece. </p></div></div></body></html>"

(If they were alive in the 1980s, they may well have voted for Reagan.)</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On the other hand, 29% are what the Institute called \"new entrant Republicans\". It is among those new Republicans that the challenge to the durability of Trump's coalition presents itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Only just over half said they would \"definitely\" support a Republican in next year's mid-term congressional elections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the survey, the new entrants are younger, more diverse and more likely to hold views that break with traditional conservative orthodoxy. They hold comparatively more left-leaning views of economic policy, they tend to be more liberal on immigration and social issues, and they may also be more pro-China or critical of Israel, for example.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/97fd/live/8cd32570-cb9c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images Someone wears a MAGA ring \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Trump was able to attract 'new entrant Republican' voters into his coalition - the question is whether he and his political heirs can keep them, or if they even want to</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Jesse Arm, vice-president of external affairs at the Manhattan Institute, told the BBC in an email: \"A lot of the conversation about the future of the right is being driven by the loudest and strangest voices online, rather than by the voters who actually make up the bulk of the Republican coalition.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Perhaps not surprisingly, the so-called new entrant Republican voters are significantly less supportive of some of Trump's would-be heirs.

It is happening just as Moscow's own shadow war on Europe is escalating again with a wave of arson and sabotage attacks that officials link to Russian intelligence.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Emergency response</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Lithuanian government has declared an emergency situation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Balloons have been used by smugglers before, but this October their number suddenly surged.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of course it started as organised crime activity across the border, but we've seen more than once how Belarus instrumentalises organised crime to have an effect on neighbouring countries,\" Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys told the BBC in the capital Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He says the balloons are launched from spots that help them best \"target\" Lithuania's main airport, just 30km (19 miles) from the border.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If you want to make a smuggling operation to take a couple of thousand packs of cigarettes to the other side, you'd do it in the woods or the swamps, not directly at our airport!\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Instead, he believes the balloons are a form of political blackmail on Europe's eastern edge.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"[Belarus] sees this as leverage: 'You have a border with us, we can cause you huge problems',\" Budrys says. \"What they're doing is really touching the military and security field and we want to prevent a military escalation.\"</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now every night the military police head out on patrol in the border zone. The balloons are most common after dark.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rattling across fields to reach remote country roads, they then set up mobile checkpoints and step out to stop vehicles at random. They check the drivers' documents and search car boots looking for anyone who may be involved in the smuggling, in the hope of smashing the networks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The balloons fly too high to make shooting them down with air defences a safe or economic option, so the government has offered a €1m (£870,000) prize to any firm that can figure out how to intercept them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In the meantime, teams use military radar to track the balloons in the sky and try to catch smugglers who turn up where the cargo drops.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Soon, new criminal charges should also act as a deterrent - with a possible prison sentence for acts of sabotage against civil aviation.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Authorities are patrolling the roads at night, searching for smugglers</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the best protection for now is a change in wind direction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was blowing east into Belarus the night we were out with the patrol and the only boxes the soldiers found in a car were full of Christmas shopping not contraband.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I haven't seen any balloons, it hasn't affected us personally,\" the woman driver told me after the spot check. \"But we live really close to the border and this whole situation really does worry us.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">What is Belarus up to?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The border itself is now marked by a tall metal fence, with a coil of vicious-looking barbed wire on top and more beyond. Below are giant concrete blocks marking the line before a Belarusian flag and a border post.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">All this extra security is the most obvious sign of how Lithuania now views its neighbour - and its ally Russia - as hostile and dangerous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Not far away in Minsk, the man who has ruled Belarus for three decades, Alexander Lukashenko, dismisses all the talk of hybrid warfare as \"nonsense\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He recently blamed \"bandit\" smugglers for the balloons, saying they were just seeking a profit and getting creative about overcoming the new security fence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Lithuania doesn't buy that, partly because Belarus already has form when it comes to \"hybrid\" attacks on the border. In 2021 migrants trying to reach the EU were helped to cross into Lithuania and Poland in big numbers, provoking a deliberate crisis.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But there are other signs of state involvement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In Vilnius, Vilmantas Vitkauskas runs the crisis management centre that brings together various branches of government and security services. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Before, he says, smugglers would send their balloons in clusters to overwhelm security forces on the other side. \"Now they are doing a sequence of one or two balloons every 30 minutes, aimed directly at the airport,\" he explains in front of a giant digital wall map that charts all the balloons spotted so far this year. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Lukashenko's Belarus... if they were interested in stopping it they can do it tomorrow. But they don't. That means it benefits them.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The suspicion is that Belarus is trying to bully its way into reducing sanctions.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Vilmantas Vitkauskas says if Belarus wanted to stop the balloons, it would</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They want to attract political attention and force us to change our policies towards Belarus,\" is how minister Kestutis Budrys sees the sudden influx of balloons.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The EU doesn't recognise Alexander Lukashenko as president because he imprisoned his main opponents ahead of disputed elections in 2020 and oversaw a brutal crackdown afterwards. The sanctions that were imposed then were tightened two years later when he helped Vladimir Putin launch Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"First, they want to end the international isolation of the regime and number two, of course, the sanctions,\" the minister argues.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US has just<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpwlkklyxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"> agreed to lift some sanctions on Belarus,</a> with the country afterwards freeing 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Budrys argues for a harder line with Minsk from Europe. \"We have to expand the sanctions regime against Belarus to include hybrid activities against the EU,\" he says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"That was done with Russia, but not with Belarus.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Disruption and delays</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For now, travellers to and from Lithuania – and the airlines – are having to adapt.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"This is something completely new for the aviation sector, none of the airports in Europe experienced that,\" airport CEO Simonas Bartkus says, inside a shiny new terminal in Vilnius.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One airline has already relocated its charter flights to Lithuania's second city and another has cut its evening flight service to Vilnius. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mr Bartkus estimates the loss of revenue for all affected businesses will reach €2m by the end of the year. \"One thing is the extra cost for us and the airlines, but the even higher risk is if passengers start to lose trust in air travel,\" he admits.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Martynas (right) says Nato is being tested - \"And we can't even fight simple balloons\"</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Already, travellers check a new webpage that gives the wind forecast and the likelihood of balloons floating into their flight path before booking.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's not easy, it makes me a little bit nervous. I'd just like to get home as planned,\" a Polish passenger said, as he waited in the terminal. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"For the last week we were checking every day,\" a local woman, Justina, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We believe this is a hybrid attack on us. I think for them it's really funny to fly those balloons and then laugh at us, not dealing with it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her words hint that another aim of hybrid activity attacks - sowing discontent and political division - is also working, and perhaps harder to defend against.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're basically testing the limits of Nato: looking how we protect against these kinds of things,\" says her partner, Martynas. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"And we can't even fight, like, simple balloons.

A synagogue was set on fire in Melbourne last year, a Jewish MP's office was vandalised and a car was torched in Sydney. A childcare centre in Sydney was also set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti in January. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Two Australian nurses were suspended and charged this year after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them.

But one thing Russia's president does not have is a poker face. </b></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The late US Senator John McCain used to joke that when he looked into Putin's eyes, he saw three things, \"a K and a G and a B\", a reference to his past life as a Soviet intelligence officer. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I thought of this as I watched footage of Russia's leader sitting opposite American envoys in the Kremlin. He could not hide his emotions; he exuded an air of supreme confidence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For President Putin reckons the diplomatic tide has turned in his favour, with an improved relationship with America and gains on the battlefield.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some analysts say Putin has no incentive to retreat from his demands: that Ukraine gives up the last 20% of Donetsk it still controls; that all occupied territory is recognised internationally as Russian; that Ukraine's army is curtailed to a point of impotence; and Nato membership is ruled out forever.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As things stand, there are a few possible scenarios. The first is that US President Donald Trump may try to force Ukraine into a ceasefire on terms unwelcome to its people, one that cedes territory and lacks sufficient security guarantees to deter future Russian aggression. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If Ukraine demurs or Russia vetoes, President Trump has hinted he could wash his hands of the war; last week, he said \"sometimes you have to let people fight it out\". </p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7a26/live/12cbc480-d768-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP via Getty Images US President Donald Trump greets Russian President Vladimir Putin \n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy urged the US to 're-establish strategic stability' with Russia</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He could remove the vital US intelligence Ukraine needs to detect incoming Russian drones and target Russian energy facilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Another possibility is that the war could just stumble on with Russia's forces continuing to make slow advances in the east. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration's new national security strategy implied that Russia is no longer an \"existential threat\" to the US, and urged the US to \"re-establish strategic stability\" with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So, with American support for Ukraine in serious question, what - if anything - could potentially change Putin's mind?

Under the banner of the \"coalition of the willing\", it is preparing an international military force to help Ukraine deter future Russian invasion, alongside a financial effort to help reconstruct the war-ravaged country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But some officials suggest that Europe should instead prepare for the war to muddle on. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They want to help Ukraine not only \"win the fight tonight\", with more drones and cash; but also provide longer term support and prepare for a 15 to 20 year war with Russia.</p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Europe could also do more to help protect Ukrainian skies from drones and missiles. There is already a plan – called the European Sky Shield Initiative – which could be expanded to allow European air defences to protect western Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others argue European troops could be deployed to western Ukraine to help patrol borders, freeing up Ukrainian soldiers to fight on the front line. Most proposals such as this have been rejected for fear of provoking Russia or escalating the conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Keir Giles, senior consulting fellow at the Russia and Eurasia programme at Chatham House think tank, said these fears were based on \"nonsense\" because Western troops were already present on the ground and Sky Shield could be deployed in western Ukraine with little chance of any clash with Russian aircraft.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">European leaders, in his view, had to \"insert themselves into the conflict in a manner that will actually make a difference\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d91d/live/27ce7da0-d768-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"WPA Pool/Getty Images (left to right) British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk\n\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">WPA Pool/Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Zelensky has offered to drop Ukraine's aspirations to join the NATO military alliance, according to some reports on Sunday.
