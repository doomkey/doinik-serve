\"You're going to see a lot more, so much secondary sanctions,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The threatened tariff hike follows meetings on Wednesday by Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow, aimed at securing peace between Russia and Ukraine. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The additional tariff would mean a steep 50% duty on key Indian exports like textiles, gems and jewellery, auto parts, and seafood, hitting major job-creating sectors. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Electronics, including iPhones, and pharma remain exempt for now.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi has previously called Trump's threat to raise tariffs over its purchase of oil from Russia \"unjustified and unreasonable\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In an earlier statement, a spokesperson for India's foreign ministry said the US had encouraged India to import Russian gas at the start of the conflict, \"for strengthening global energy markets stability\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said India \"began importing from Russia because traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the outbreak of the conflict\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The latest threatened tariff demonstrates Trump's willingness to impose sanctions related to the war in Ukraine even against nations that the US considers to be important allies or trading partners. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This could be a warning that other countries could feel a real bite if Trump ramps up those kind of sanctions once Friday's deadline passes, when the US president has threatened new sanctions on Russia and to place 100% tariffs on countries that purchase its oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This would not be the first time the Trump administration has imposed secondary tariffs, which are also in place to punish buyers of Venezuelan oil.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has previously criticised the US - its largest trading partner - for introducing the levies, when the US itself is still doing trade with Russia. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Last year, the US traded goods worth an estimated $3.5bn (£2.6bn) with Russia, despite tough sanctions and tariffs.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have in the past referred to each other as friends and, during Trump's first term, attended political rallies in each others' countries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that has not stopped Trump from hitting India with the levies, suggesting diverging interests between New Delhi and Washington.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Federation of India Exports Organisations has called the decision to impose additional tariffs \"extremely shocking\", adding that it will hit 55% of India's exports to America.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The tariffs are expected to make Indian goods far costlier in the US, and could cut US-bound exports by 40–50%, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"India should remain calm, avoid retaliation for at least six months, and recognise that meaningful trade negotiations with the US cannot proceed under threats or mistrust,\" former Indian trade official and head of GTRI, Ajay Srivastava, said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><i id=\"with-additional-analysis-from-bbc-north-america-correspondent-anthony-zurcher.\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU\">With additional analysis from BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher.</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

The conflict has raged on, and his rhetoric towards Moscow has since hardened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"We thought we had [the war] settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,\" he said last month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Three rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia in Istanbul have failed to bring the war closer to an end, three-and-a-half years after Moscow launched its full-invasion.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Moscow's military and political preconditions for peace remain unacceptable to Kyiv and to its Western partners. The Kremlin has also repeatedly turned down Kyiv's requests for a meeting between Zelensky and Putin.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, the US administration approved $200m (£150m) of additional military sales to Ukraine on Tuesday following a phone call between Zelensky and Trump, in which the two leaders also discussed defence co-operation and drone production. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ukraine has been using drones to hit Russia's refineries and energy facilities, while Moscow has focused its air attacks on Ukraine's cities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Kyiv City Military Administration said the toll of an attack on the city last week rose to 32 after a man died of his injuries.

They climbed on top of the trucks, causing the drivers to lose control, local journalists told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The area was under Israeli military control and the roads were rugged and dangerous, civil defence agency spokesman Mahmoud Basal said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The private transport association now operating in Gaza said that 26 commercial trucks entered the territory on Tuesday.

The regions of Sicilia and Calabria are two of the poorest in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, the project will still need to be rubber-stamped by the Italian Court of Auditors as well as environmental agencies, both at national and EU level.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local residents on either side of the strait whose properties may be expropriated will also have to be consulted and could legally challenge the decision, meaning the construction of the bridge may be delayed or stall altogether.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It would not be the first time that the bridge's building has been held up. Since the first plans for it were drawn up more than 50 years ago, various ideas for it have had to be shelved for various reasons and it has long faced stern opposition.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has included concerns that huge amounts of taxpayers' money would be siphoned off by the Sicilian and Calabrian mafias, which have a broad influence over politics and society in southern Italy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On Wednesday, local politicians reiterated their unhappiness with the government's decision. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Nicola Irto of the Democratic Party (PD) called the project was \"controversial and divisive\", saying it would divert \"crucial resources from local transportation, modern infrastructure, safe schools and quality healthcare facilities\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Giusy Caminiti, the mayor of Villa San Giovanni near where the bridge would be built on the Calabrian shore, said her town would be badly affected and urged more time for consultations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Grassroots Calabrian committee \"No to the Bridge\" slammed Wednesday's announcement and said it was a political manoeuvre, rather than the outcome of a thorough technical evaluation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Local groups that oppose the bridge also say its construction would use millions of litres of water a day while both Sicily and Calabria regularly struggle with drought. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Currently the only way for trains to cross the Strait is to have the coaches shunted onto ferries and carried over the sea in a 30-minute journey. </p></div></div></body></html>"

tour a manufacturing facility in 2019, when Apple avoided tariffs on its products after announcing investments in the US</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Cook also presented Trump with a glass statue, which he assembled in the Oval Office's Resolute Desk. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Analysts said any significant change to Apple's supply chain would take time, but the company's promise might help it win lighter treatment from the White House, given Trump's focus on increasing business investments in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Shares surged more than 5% on Wednesday after the news.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In a statement on Wednesday, the White House said the firm's latest pledge was a sign that Trump's policies were convincing companies to put more money into the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" a White House spokesperson said.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Apple has long made the bulk of its products in China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It avoided duties during Trump's first term after agreeing to invest more in America, in announcements that it coordinated with the White House. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But it has been scrambling since Trump launched a new tariff war in January, announcing an additional 30% levy on Chinese-made goods.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Apple has responded to changes by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reworking its supply chain</a>, shipping goods to the US primarily <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ykd997kjjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">from India and Vietnam</a>, which face lower tariffs on their exports. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the company still paid out more than $800m in new border taxes on its products over the three months ended in June, reflecting Trump's sweeping global so-called reciprocal tariffs, which have been in place since April. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It is expecting to pay another $1.1bn in coming months, despite exemptions from the measures that the White House granted to certain electronics in April. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">With tariffs on Indian-made goods now set to ramp up to 50%, it has raised tariff worries. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On a call with investors, Mr Cook emphasised Apple's involvement in the US, and its longstanding strategy of working with \"third parties\" to make investments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He pointed to its previously announced plans to launch a \"manufacturing academy\" in Michigan,<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>as well its pledge to buy $500m in rare earth magnets from MP Materials, which is working to expand production of rare earths in the US. The US government has taken a stake in that company as well, while committing to a minimum price for its output. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since his return to office, Trump has often promoted high-profile commitments of investments by firms like Apple. Analysts say the numbers he uses often appear exaggerated and there is <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/clynl129kd2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">no evidence yet of a wider trend</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Paolo Pescatore, founder of PP Foresight, praised Mr Cook for deft navigation of Apple through \"turbulent times\" but said it remained to be seen what the investment would mean for the many different pieces that go into Apple devices and where they are produced. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Certainly if you look at the case today, it's impossible to think now everything could just suddenly be produced, manufactured and put together in the US overnight,\" he said. </p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Some are attributed to lung and heart conditions exacerbated by smoke or stress, while others are more indirect - like delayed healthcare treatment for dialysis or cancer patients as a result of fire-related disruptions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The authors said that the findings underscore the need for officials to count both direct and indirect fatalities of wildfires and other climate-related emergencies when trying to quantify their impact. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They also highlight the need for improved mortality surveillance during and after wildfire emergencies,\" the authors said, noting that their figures are provisional as there may have been additional fire-related deaths beyond the scope of the study.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to an inquiry from the BBC, a spokesperson for Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said the agency had \"no specific comment on the study\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"However, it is not unusual for emergencies or disasters to unfortunately result in either premature or excess deaths,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"These types of incidents often overwhelm systems, disrupt normal life-sustaining services, and often expose people to harmful environments, leading to earlier-than-expected and more-than-expected deaths.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2f60/live/c9abfc80-72ee-11f0-9eb3-2b71669c0257.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Getty Images Lay leader Aviana Springs, wearing a full white boiler suit, carries away a box containing jars of ashes she collected from the remains of Altadena United Methodist Church which burned in the Eaton Fire in January.

The plan was to build its hull - the part where the passengers would sit - out of carbon fibre.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">No deep diving sub had been made out of this material before - most have hulls constructed from titanium or steel. But Lochridge had confidence in the APL team.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He said he was told by Oceangate's CEO Stockton Rush that the craft would undergo a safety assessment by an independent marine organisation, known as certification.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge was adamant that this third-party oversight was essential - especially because Titan was to be made of experimental materials.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But by the summer of 2016 he was starting to have doubts about the project.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate stopped working with APL and decided to bring the design and construction of Titan in-house.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge was worried. He didn't have the same confidence in Oceangate's engineers. He told the BBC he didn't think they had experience of building subs able to withstand the immense pressures found at the depth of the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"At that point, I started asking questions… and I felt I had a duty of care to keep asking them,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As the parts for Titan began to arrive, and the craft started to take shape, Lochridge said he was spotting problem after problem.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"When the carbon hull came in, it was an absolute mess,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He saw visible gaps in the material, areas where the layers of carbon fibre were coming apart - known as delamination.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And he identified issues with other key components.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc04/live/17b2e760-5c13-11f0-a242-c52ffeb44368.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"David Lochridge David Lochridge onboard the deck of a ship.

He was also worried that the sub's view port had not been designed to work at extreme depths.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Most concerning, he learnt that Titan was not going to be independently certified for safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He told the BBC that he had always been outspoken on safety issues - so he wasn't going to stay silent.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I brought up all the issues that I was seeing… but I was just met with resistance all the way,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In January 2018, he outlined his concerns again to Stockton Rush. This time Rush asked him to complete an inspection of the vessel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Titan was at a crucial point of its development. Passengers had already paid deposits for dives to the Titanic planned for later that year. Test dives were about to start in the Bahamas before those expeditions got underway.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge wanted Oceangate to delay these plans.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I formulated a report and I sent it out to all the directors in the company.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The following day he was summoned to a meeting with Rush and several other Oceangate employees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A transcript from the two-hour-long meeting, where the itemised report was picked over, reveals a heated exchange between Lochridge and Rush.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Towards the end of the meeting, in response to Lochridge's safety concerns, Rush says: \"I have no desire to die. I've got a nice granddaughter. I'm going to be around. I understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eyes open, and I think this is one of the safest things I will ever do.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">To Lochridge's surprise, immediately after this meeting he was fired.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he was so concerned about Titan that he got in touch with the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration - OSHA.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA told him his case was urgent because it involved public safety and that he would be placed under the whistleblower protection scheme, designed to protect employees from retaliation by employers if they've reported concerns about workplace safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">As part of this process, OSHA passed Lochridge's concerns about Titan to the US Coast Guard (USCG) in February 2018.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But Lochridge says after OSHA wrote to Oceangate to tell them it was starting an investigation, everything changed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March, Oceangate asked Lochridge to drop the OSHA complaint - and demanded he pay $10,000 for legal costs. Lochridge declined.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Then in July 2018, Oceangate sued Lochridge - and his wife Carole - for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud and theft, amongst other allegations. The following month, Lochridge countersued for unfair dismissal.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Lochridge maintains that throughout the process OSHA was slow and failed to protect him from the ongoing retaliation he was receiving from Oceangate.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I provided all the documentation to OSHA, I was on the phone to OSHA every few weeks.\" he said. \"OSHA did nothing.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'They beat us down'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In December 2018, under increasing pressure from Oceangate's lawyers, Lochridge and his wife took the decision to drop the case.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This meant the legal proceedings were settled, and as part of this agreement Lochridge withdrew his complaint at OSHA. OSHA stopped its investigation and also notified the US Coast guard that the complaint had been suspended. Lochridge also signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Carole and I did everything we physically could, we just got to the point that we were completely burned… We had nothing left to give to it. They beat us down.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate continued at pace with its plans to reach the Titanic.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2018 and 2019, the prototype sub made its first test dives in the Bahamas - including one, piloted by Stockton Rush, that reached a depth of 3,939m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A crack was later found in the sub's carbon fibre hull, and in 2020 that damaged hull was swapped out for a new one, in what became the second version of Titan.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In 2021, the company started taking passengers to the Titanic, and over the next two summers made 13 dives to the famous wreck.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But in June 2023, the sub went missing with five people on board - including Stockton Rush. After days of anxious waiting, the sub's wreckage was found littered across the ocean floor.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the US Coast Guard's public hearings held last year, Lochridge criticised OSHA for its lack of action. \"I believe that if OSHA had attempted to investigate the seriousness of the concerns I raised on multiple occasions, this tragedy may have been prevented.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It didn't need to happen. It didn't - and it should have been stopped.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In response to Mr Lochridge, a spokesperson for OSHA said its whistleblower protection programme was limited to protecting individuals against employer retaliation. They said their investigation had \"followed the normal process and timeline for a retaliation case\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">OSHA said it does not investigate whistleblowers' underlying allegations about public safety… but instead refers those to the appropriate agency - in this case, the US Coast Guard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The spokesperson said: \"The Coast Guard, not OSHA, had jurisdiction to investigate Mr. Lochridge's allegations regarding the safe design and construction of marine vessels.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the US Coast Guard's report into the disaster agrees with Lochridge and says that OSHA's slow handling of the investigation was a missed opportunity for early government intervention.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The report also criticises a lack of effective communication and coordination between OSHA and the USCG. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The investigation found that the email from OSHA to the coast guard about Mr Lochridge's complaint was not received. It had been sent to a staff member who had responsibility for monitoring OSHA cases – but the employee had moved on to a new job within the agency.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Jason Neubauer,  the chair of the USCG's Marine Board of Investigation, told the BBC that the coast guard could have done more. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The system did not work for the whistleblower in this case, and that's why we just need to get better - and we have.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Oceangate said that in the wake of the accident, it had permanently wound down operations and directed its resources towards cooperating with the inquiry.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Israel regularly identifies and targets Hamas salary distributors, seeking to disrupt the group's ability to govern.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Employees, from police officers to tax officials, often receive an encrypted message on their own phones or their spouses' instructing them to go to a specific location at a specific time to \"meet a friend for tea\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">At the meeting point, the employee is approached by a man - or occasionally a woman - who discreetly hands over a sealed envelope containing the money before vanishing without further interaction.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">An employee at the Hamas Ministry of Religious Affairs, who doesn't want to give his name for safety reasons, described the dangers involved in collecting his wages. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time I go to pick up my salary, I say goodbye to my wife and children. I know that I may not return,\" he said. \"On several occasions, Israeli strikes have hit the salary distribution points. I survived one that targeted a busy market in Gaza City.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Alaa, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, is a schoolteacher employed by the Hamas-run government and the sole provider for a family of six.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I received 1,000 shekels (about $300) in worn-out banknotes - no trader would accept them. Only 200 shekels were usable - the rest, I honestly don't know what to do with,\" he told the BBC. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"After two-and-a-half months of hunger, they pay us in tattered cash.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I'm often forced to go to aid distribution points in the hope of getting some flour to feed my children. Sometimes I succeed in bringing home a little, but most of the time I fail.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In March the Israeli military said they had killed the head of Hamas's finances, Ismail Barhoum, in a strike on Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. They accused him of channelling funds to Hamas's military wing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It remains unclear how Hamas has managed to continue funding salary payments given the destruction of much of its administrative and financial infrastructure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One senior Hamas employee, who served in high positions and is familiar with Hamas's financial operations, told the BBC that the group had stockpiled approximately $700m in cash and hundreds of millions of shekels in underground tunnels prior to the group's deadly 7 October 2023 attack in southern Israel, which sparked the devastating Israeli military campaign.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These were allegedly overseen directly by Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Mohammed - both of whom have since been killed by Israeli forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Anger at reward for Hamas supporters</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Hamas has historically relied on funding from heavy import duties and taxes imposed on Gaza's population, as well as receiving millions of dollars of support from Qatar.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing which operates through a separate financial system, is financed mainly by Iran. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A senior official from the banned Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood, one of the most influential Islamist organisations in the world, has said that around 10% of their budget was also directed to Hamas.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In order to generate revenue during the war, Hamas has also continued to levy taxes on traders and has sold large quantities of cigarettes at inflated prices up to 100 times their original cost. Before the war, a box of 20 cigarettes cost $5 - that has now risen to more than $170.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In addition to cash payments, Hamas has distributed food parcels to its members and their families via local emergency committees whose leadership is frequently rotated due to repeated Israeli strikes.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That has fuelled public anger, with many residents in Gaza accusing Hamas of distributing aid only to its supporters and excluding the wider population.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid that has entered Gaza during the ceasefire earlier this year, something Hamas denies. However BBC sources in Gaza have said that significant quantities of aid were taken by Hamas during this time.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Nisreen Khaled, a widow left caring for three children after her husband died of cancer five years ago, told the BBC: \"When the hunger worsened, my children were crying not only from pain but also from watching our Hamas-affiliated neighbours receive food parcels and sacks of flour. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Are they not the reason for our suffering?

Now that looks increasingly difficult, if not impossible.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">So what went wrong?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A series of missteps, grandstanding, geopolitics and domestic political pressure seem to have broken down the negotiations.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Delhi has been restrained in its response so far to Trump's tirades, hoping that diplomacy might eventually help secure a trade deal. But in Trump's White House, there are no guarantees.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has commented on many issues that Delhi considers red lines. The biggest among them is Trump repeatedly putting <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjwq0y7d14lo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">India and its rival Pakistan on an equal footing</a>.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/701c/live/1bcae390-72af-11f0-a0d2-e3caada09ed7.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images Oil tanker trucks outside an oil refinery operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp.

He went as far as saying that some day, Pakistan might sell oil to India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Another constant irritant for Delhi is Trump's repeated assertion that the US brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India sees its dispute with Pakistan over Kashmir as its internal affair and has always rejected third-party mediation on the issue. Most world leaders have been sensitive to Delhi's position, including Trump in his first stint as president.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But that's no longer the case. The US president has doubled down on his claim even after Modi told India's parliament that \"no country had mediated in the ceasefire\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi didn't name Trump or the US but domestic political pressure is mounting on him not to \"bow down\" to the White House.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The fact that this is happening against the backdrop of heavy and high-level US engagement with Islamabad immediately after an India-Pakistan conflict is even more galling for Delhi and the wider Indian public. This all sharpens concerns harboured by some in India that the US can't truly be trusted as a partner,\" says Washington-based South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He adds that some of the anger in Delhi might \"be Cold War-era baggage coming to the fore\", but \"this time around it's intensified by real-time developments as well\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Modi's government thrives on nationalist issues, so its supporters would likely expect a firm response to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It's a Catch-22 situation - Delhi still wants to clinch a deal but also doesn't want to come across as buckling under Trump's pressure.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">And it appears that Delhi is gradually releasing the restraint. In its response to Washington's anger over India's purchase of Russian oil, Delhi vowed to take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard its \"national interests and economic security\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question is why Trump, who loved India's hospitality and called it a great country earlier, has gone on a tirade against a trusted ally.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some analysts see his insults as a pressure tactic to secure a deal that he thinks works for the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is a real estate magnate and a tough negotiator. His style may not be diplomatic, but he seeks the outcomes diplomats would. So, I think what he's doing is part of a negotiating strategy,\" says Jitendra Nath Misra, a former Indian ambassador and now a professor at OP Jindal Global University.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A source in the Indian government said that Delhi gave many concessions to Washington, including no tariffs on industrial goods, and a phased reduction of tariffs on cars and alcohol.

How Delhi reacts will decide the future of the India-US relationship.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India has been measured in its response so far but is not holding back completely. In its statement, it said that the US had encouraged it to keep buying oil from Russia for global energy market stability.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It also said that targeting it was unjustified as the EU continues to buy energy, fertiliser, mining and chemical products from Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While things seem bad, some analysts say that all is not lost. India and the US have close links in many sectors, which can't be uprooted overnight.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The two countries cooperate closely in the space technology, IT, education and defence sectors.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many large domestic IT firms have invested heavily in the US, and most big Silicon Valley firms have operations in India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"I think the fundamentals of the relationship are not weak. It's a paradox that the day Trump announced 25% tariffs and unspecified penalties, India and the US collaborated in a strategic area when an <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy98jnreqvvo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Indian rocket sent a jointly-developed satellite into space</a>,\" says Mr Misra. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">It will be interesting to see how India reacts to Trump's sharp rhetoric.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Trump is unapologetically transactional and commercial in his approach to foreign policy. He has no compunction about deploying these potentially alienating harsh tactics against a close US partner like India,\" says Mr Kugelman.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he adds that there's a lot of trust baked into the partnership, given the work that has gone into it over the past two decades.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"So what's lost can potentially be regained.

If that protein in the coronavirus changes or mutates then the body's protection is lessened.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">We have seen the consequences of that – immunity wanes and the vaccines need to be updated.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One theoretical argument is that a different vaccine approach – such as using the whole virus – would give better protection, as the immune system would have more to target.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Prof Pollard says the mRNA vaccines performed better than the inactivated ones when tackling Covid.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He says that is probably down to the way they are made - and the fact that the process of killing the virus also \"changes the viral proteins so there is less stimulation of the immune system\" in comparison with mRNA vaccines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The need to update vaccines is not a failing of mRNA technology that can be easily solved by pivoting from one technology to another - instead, it is down to the fundamental nature of some viruses.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The same measles or HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccines have been effective for decades and show no sign of failing as the virus's genetic codes are more stable in each case. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But some viruses live in a perpetual state of flux.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Flu, for example, is not one virus - but instead a constantly-shifting target. At any time, one strain will be in the ascendancy and be the most likely to cause trouble in winter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In flu, the inactivated flu injection that is given to adults is updated every year - as is the live vaccine that is given to children as a nasal spray. A future mRNA form of flu vaccine would work the same way.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"The point about keeping up with variants is about all technologies, not just mRNA,\" says Prof Pollard.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">mRNA is 'streets ahead' when speed is needed</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">There is a legitimate scientific question about which vaccine technology is used for which disease.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What is causing concern among scientists is that pulling mRNA research means we will not have those vaccines at times when we need to do what no other technology can.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard says: \"I don't think there's the evidence they are hugely better for protection, but where RNA tech is streets ahead of everything else is responding to outbreaks.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The world is highly drilled at making new flu vaccines each year. But even then, there is a six-month process of deciding on the new flu strains to be targeted, growing the vaccine at scale in chicken eggs and then distributing it. Brand new vaccines take even longer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But with mRNA, you can have the new vaccine in six to eight weeks, and then tens or hundreds of millions of doses a few months later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Some of the projects that have had their funding pulled in the US were preparing for a bird flu pandemic. That virus, H5N1, has been devastating bird populations and jumping into a wide range of other animals including American cattle.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That doesn't make sense and if we do get a human pandemic of bird flu it could be seen as a catastrophic error,\" says Prof Finn.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the ramifications of the US turning away from mRNA research could be felt more widely.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">What impact does this move have on confidence in the current vaccines, mRNA or otherwise? How does it affect the world when the US is one of the most influential countries in medical research? And will it have a knock-on impact on other types of mRNA technology, such as cancer vaccines - or using the approach to treat rare genetic diseases?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Prof Pollard poses another question after RFK Jr's move: \"Does it put us all at risk if a huge market is turning its back on RNA?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It is one of the most important technologies we'll see this century in infectious disease, biotherapeutic agents for rare disease and critically for cancer. It's a message I'm troubled about.\"</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

That led to a spike in inflation around the world. President Trump says he isn't worried because of record US oil production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Mr Tompkins points out that, this time, there are also other reasons to suggest the impact on prices would not be as marked. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He explains that \"the current backdrop is one where Opec+ [the group of major oil producing countries and its allies] have significant spare capacity to draw upon\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia has devised a whole system for avoiding existing sanctions, which could be useful for helping its trading partners avoid the secondary tariffs threatened by Trump.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">For example, its so-called \"shadow fleet\" - consisting of hundreds of tankers with obscure ownership - could be used to conceal the origin of exported Russian oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Sanctions maintenance is as big a task as the imposition of sanctions in the first place,\" US sanctions expert Richard Nephew of Columbia University says. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"That's because the party that is being sanctioned takes steps to evade them.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48bb/live/4cb38ad0-71f0-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt='Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Two young people carry a handpainted poster of Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump with the writing \"Unpredictable &amp; shocking 25% tariff + penalty\"' class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">\"The targeting of India is unjustified and unreasonable,\" the country's foreign ministry said</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Pricier iPhones from India</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, India has been the second biggest buyer of Russian oil, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.russiafossiltracker.com/\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air</a>. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"They're fuelling the war machine. And if they're going to do that, then I'm not going to be happy,\" President Trump told US outlet CNBC on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A day later, Trump signed an executive order hitting India with an additional 25% tariff over its purchases of Russian oil and raising the total tariff on Indian imports to the US to 50% - among the highest rates imposed by the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If secondary sanctions take effect in 21 days' as Trump's executive order specifies, US companies buying goods from India will have to pay a 100% import tax - or tariff - when those products reach US shores.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The idea is that it makes these goods so expensive that US businesses will choose to buy them cheaper from elsewhere, resulting in lost revenue for India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That, in turn, is supposed to deter India from buying Russian oil. And if Russia is left unable to sell its oil elsewhere because other countries face the same predicament, it will have less cash to finance the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">One way in which Americans could experience higher prices as a result of new secondary tariffs is in their purchase of mobile phones from India.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">US firm Apple is moving much of its iPhone <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c86jx18y9e2o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">production to India</a> - in particular the manufacturing of handsets that it wants to sell in the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If these products are subject to the new tariffs, prices could rise significantly for US consumers. That is because tariffs are paid by the companies that import goods - and those companies tend to pass most, if not all, of their cost increases on to their customers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Imports to the US from India were already facing a 25% tariff as part of President Trump's broader trade shake-up.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">India's government has accused the US of double standards, pointing to Washington's own continued trade with Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The vast majority of that trade is made up of US imports from Russia, which amounted to just over $3bn (£2.2bn) last year - although that's just 10% of 2021 levels. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">That trade is dominated by US purchases of raw materials for nuclear energy and fertilisers.

Brussels recently agreed to buy a lot <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">more energy from the US</a>, but some imports from Russia remain. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In June, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1504\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">acknowledged the problem</a>, saying \"Russia has repeatedly attempted to blackmail us by weaponizing its energy supplies\" as she laid out plans to end imports by the end of 2027.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US-EU trade relationship is the biggest in the world, and the pair have just negotiated new trade terms<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL\"> </b>which will see a 15% tariff be applied on most EU exports to the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Many in the EU <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgp5q4x4nzo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">criticised that deal</a>, saying the tariffs would harm European exporters. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Now they also fear that secondary sanctions on the EU could do even more harm. Adding 100% tariffs for buying Russian energy could significantly reduce the amount of goods sold by the EU to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However the biggest sellers include pharmaceuticals and machinery, which may be hard to source from elsewhere - meaning Americans have little choice but to pay more. </p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Potential Russian recession</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Russia's own economy has so far proven remarkably resilient since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine began, growing 4.3% last year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpqnj17vryjo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">recently warned</a> that the country was \"on the verge\" of recession after a period of \"overheating\". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is forecasting growth of just 0.9% this year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">If the secondary sanctions are successful in reducing demand for exports, they will push Russia closer to recession.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The exact impact of the war on Russia's economy is hard to know, because Moscow has prevented a large amount of economic data from being published since the full-scale invasion - including on oil and gas production.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">About a third of Russian government spending is funded by oil and gas money, but exports have been falling. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Meanwhile, Putin is directing a bigger share of spending towards defence than at any time since the Cold War. Defence spending is believed to have reached 6.3% of GDP.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">By contrast, Ukraine has been spending a huge 26% of the value of its far-smaller economy on the war. The difference explains why its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has repeatedly asked for external help from his allies.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump's tariffs are intended to help Zelensky by cutting the amount of money flowing into Russia, and he hopes bring an end to the death, suffering and destruction in Ukraine.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

Since he returned to office in January, recorded aerial attacks from Moscow have reached their highest levels of the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to bring an end to fighting in just one day if returned to office. He claimed during his 2024 campaign that Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine could have been averted had a president who the Kremlin \"respected\" held office.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">However, in his efforts to achieve a ceasefire he has been accused at times of favouring Russia by critics, and his administration has paused deliveries of air defence munitions and other military supplies to Ukraine on two separate occasions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The pauses - announced in March and July and since reversed by the president - came as Russia steadily increased missile and drone production. According to Ukrainian military intelligence, ballistic missile construction in Russia grew by 66% over the past year.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The data reviewed by BBC Verify - based on daily incident reports issued by the Ukrainian Air Force - showed that Russia launched 27,158 munitions between 20 January - when Trump's presidency began - and 19 July, compared with 11,614 over the final six months of Biden's term.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"This brutal war was brought on by Joe Biden's incompetence, and it has gone on for far too long,\" White House deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement to BBC Verify. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"President Trump wants to stop the killing, which is why he is selling American-made weapons to Nato members and threatening Putin with biting tariffs and sanctions if he does not agree to a ceasefire.\" </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In the opening weeks of the new administration, the White House issued a series of warm statements seemingly intended to entice President Vladimir Putin towards a settlement. During this period, Russian attacks on Ukraine briefly fell when compared with the final weeks of the Biden administration.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But by February, when US diplomats led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's delegation for a summit in Riyadh, attacks had started to climb again.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The talks, which Rubio said were a starting point to bring an end to the war, have been followed by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/crene7d5w2jo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">mediated discussions between Ukrainian and Russian officials</a> in Turkey. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Attacks peaked early last month, when Moscow launched 748 drones and missiles towards Ukraine on 9 July, according to the Ukrainian Air Force data. More than a dozen people were <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3rvpe06rxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">reportedly injured by the barrage and two were killed</a>.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Trump has expressed anger at the escalating Russian attacks on several occasions, his mounting frustration does not appear to have had an impact on Moscow's strategy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">On 25 May, Russia launched its then-largest recorded barrage, prompting Trump to angrily ask: \"What the hell happened to him [Putin]?\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Since then, Russia has exceeded that number of reported launches on 14 occasions. Trump has responded by demanding that the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c707zrrd7xqo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Kremlin reach a peace deal with Ukraine by 8 August</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The number of Russian munitions penetrating Ukrainian air defences appears to be increasing, with explosions around the capital Kyiv becoming a daily part of life for residents of the city.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you go to sleep, you don't know if you're going to wake up the next morning, and that's just not a normal way to live,\" Dasha Volk, a journalist living in the city, told the BBC's Ukrainecast programme in June.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"Every time you hear an explosion or a missile flying over your head, lots of thoughts are going through my mind - I'm going to die now, things like that.\"</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">Ukraine 'vulnerable' to aerial attacks</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Senator Chris Coons, a senior Democrat on the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told BBC Verify that Trump's decision to suspend weapons supplies on two occasions and his broader approach to Russian relations may have convinced the Kremlin that it had the freedom to increase attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">\"It's clear Putin feels emboldened by Trump's weakness and has increased his vicious assault on the Ukrainian people, repeatedly attacking hospitals and maternity wards, the Ukrainian power grid, and other civilian sites,\" he said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The growing attacks have renewed calls for the US to send fresh supplies of Patriot anti-air batteries to Ukraine. The Patriots are the most capable and expensive air defence systems that Ukraine has. Each Patriot battery costs around $1bn (£800m), and each missile costs nearly $4m.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Trump has overturned the previous supply pauses and agreed to sell weapons to Nato members, who will in turn supply them to Kyiv. Trump appeared to imply that the deal would include fresh supplies of Patriot batteries.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Justin Bronk, an analyst focussing on the Russian military at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said restrictions on the supply of military equipment imposed by the White House had made Ukraine \"vulnerable\" to missile and drone attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But he also noted that Russia has ramped up the production of missiles and so-called 'kamikaze' drones such as the Geran-2 - a domestically produced version of the Iranian Shahed drone. Mr Bronk said that Russia's increased stockpiles, coupled with \"significant reductions\" in supply of US interceptor missiles had encouraged Moscow to escalate its air campaign.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9656/live/e58cc5e0-7200-11f0-88cf-791e5d4bcee3.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"EPA A captured Geran drone in Ukraine.

Beijing has long viewed self-ruled Taiwan as part of its territory, vowing to \"reunify\" with it some day while not ruling out the use of force.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The series, which aired its first episode over the weekend, was partially funded by the Taiwanese government, which hopes to raise awareness about the threat China poses. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the show has also landed at a highly divisive moment in Taiwan and attracted criticism of fear-mongering.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zero Day Attack focuses on how various parts of Taiwanese society grapple with the invasion, from the president to rural villagers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The anthology series features several scenarios on how an invasion could unfold, provided by defence experts consulted by the production team. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">These include the disruption of Taiwan's communication lines; Chinese disinformation campaigns; \"fifth column\" supporters of China stirring up unrest; and military officials turned collaborators who conspire against Taiwan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Showrunner Cheng Hsin-mei told the BBC she wanted to make the series to \"warn the Taiwanese people that the war is really coming,\" citing China's rising use of \"disinformation campaigns and grey zone warfare to put our society in chaos and make us confused about our identity\".</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5145/live/29f12800-6e98-11f0-8fff-3d35836e2f17.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Zeroday Cultural and Creative Screengrab from Zero Day Attack showing masked men in white shirts and green trousers beating up protesters on the streets of Taipei.

Chunghwa Telecoms, Taiwan's largest telecommunications company in which the government has a minority stake, also contributed funding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Other private investors include billionaire Robert Tsao, a well-known supporter of Taiwanese independence who has <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63196623\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">funded civil defence efforts</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Ms Cheng told the BBC that at no point did the authorities try to influence the show. She also said she was not a member of the DPP or any political party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But even before a single episode was broadcast, Zero Day Attack has become a political lightning rod, given the charged topic.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 eOFjmw\">'Selling dried mangoes'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A 17-minute trailer posted online last year by the production team swiftly racked up hundreds of thousands of views and comments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While some praised it for its message, others criticised it for sowing anxiety and discord with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This debate has intensified with the series premiere, which was the most-watched show on several platforms on Saturday, according to the production company. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">In recent days Wang Hung-wei, a prominent lawmaker from the opposition Kuomintang party, criticised Zero Day Attack as \"selling dried mangoes\", a Taiwanese euphemism that means stoking unnecessary fear about the destruction of one's country.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Pointing to the government's funding of the show, Ms Wang said the DPP was \"using the state apparatus to achieve its political goals\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">A commentary by Wang Kunyi of the Taiwan International Strategic Study Society accused the show of pushing Taiwan independence \"so that Taiwan becomes a place that never knows peace\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">He added that it was evidence of Lai's government \"once again using all kinds of channels to play the 'anti-Communist card' and stir up anxiety of war\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The DPP and Lai are often accused by their critics, including the opposition and China, as pushing for Taiwan's independence. Any formal declaration as such would be considered as an act of war by Beijing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">While Lai has in the past described himself as a \"pragmatic worker for Taiwan's independence\", he has also insisted Taiwan has no need to formally declare independence because it is already a sovereign nation.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250728-162205-9b8a2dcb37-web-2.26.0-8/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9a8/live/e5e42190-71e8-11f0-a178-03cc5fabe4bc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te inspects the troops taking part in the Rapid Response Exercise during a visit at the Songshan military airbase in Taipei on March 21, 2025. \" class=\"sc-d1200759-0 dvfjxj\"><span class=\"sc-d1200759-2 gwFzuU\">Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq\">Taiwan's President William Lai on a recent visit to a military base </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Zero Day Attack has also garnered positive reviews.

Last month the island held a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8185e19l4o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">controversial failed recall vote</a> of Kuomintang lawmakers accused of being too friendly with China. Another round will take place later this month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">This has led to questions about the show's timing and if it was meant to influence the recall votes. Ms Cheng told the BBC that the show's production had begun long before the recall movement started.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"></p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The discussion around the show goes to the heart of one of Taiwan's most existential questions: how real is the threat of a Chinese invasion?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Taiwan has had its own government since the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. In the following decades, the island saw largely peaceful relations and stronger economic ties with China.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Polls show that most Taiwanese do not believe Beijing will attack imminently, and prefer the \"status quo\" in Taiwan's relationship with China, which means neither unifying with Beijing nor formally declaring independence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">But the question of a Chinese invasion has become sharper and more political in recent years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">Chinese grey</a> <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-66851118\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi\">zone warfare</a> has spiked, raising fears that Chinese warplanes and ships repeatedly entering Taiwan's airspace and waters could trigger a conflict.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">The US warned this year that China poses an \"imminent threat\" to Taiwan. American officials have repeatedly claimed that Chinese President Xi Jinping is building up his military to be capable of invading Taiwan by 2027.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS\">Beijing has never confirmed this date.
