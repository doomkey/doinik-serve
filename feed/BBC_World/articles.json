But the six nuclear reactors of the Zaporizhzhia plant are not producing electricity - they have all been in cold shutdown mode for more than three years -  and external power supplied by Ukraine is keeping the plant going to prevent a meltdown.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To get it going again it needs substantial investment, partly to rebuild the destroyed Kakhovka hydro-electric dam that was used to provide cooling water for the plant.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine believes the area should also become demilitarised and turned into a free economic zone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US proposal, according to Zelensky, is for the US to manage the plant as a joint enterprise with Russia and Ukraine. Kyiv has said that is unrealistic and instead the US and Ukraine could jointly manage it 50-50, with the US deciding where half of the power goes - by implication to Russia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine's problem is that Russia will not let it go and the head of Russia's Rosatom nuclear agency Alexei Likachev has stressed that only one entity - Russia - can run it and ensure its safety.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has held out the possibility that Ukraine could use electricity generated by the plant in the context of international co-operation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Compromise on this issue may not be insurmountable, but it would require a level of trust between two neighbouring states when none exists.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/04b4/live/69d8ebf0-e59f-11f0-8bbe-6935d94eeebc.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Washington Post via Getty Images A man wheels a barrow towards a dumpster on a road that is overlooked by the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant on the Russian controlled southern bank side of the Dnipro river\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Washington Post via Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant dominates the skyline near the Dnipro river</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lack of mutual trust despite positive rhetoric</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is hard to imagine significant progress on the biggest sticking points when there is so little trust.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump suggested this week that Putin \"wants to see Ukraine succeed… including supplying energy… at very low prices\", Zelensky clearly did not believe a word of it - he does not consider Putin as serious about peace.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't trust Russians and... I don't trust Putin, and he doesn't want success for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian leader said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia has also shown little faith in Kyiv - accusing Ukrainian forces of targeting drones at a Putin residence in the Novgorod region, although it gave no evidence of the attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ukraine denies it even happened and believes it is a Russian pretext for further Russian strikes on government buildings in Kyiv.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other sticking points that could derail deal</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Kyiv has asked the US and European leaders for security guarantees to ensure a Nato-style response in the event of a further Russian attack. Ukraine is also seeking to maintain an 800,000-strong military.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although the US and Europe might sign up to a deal on security, Russia will not accept European troops on the ground in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Financial losses for Ukraine have been estimated at $800bn (£600bn), so another key issue is how much will Russia contribute to that. The US talks of a joint investment fund with Europe, and Russia has €210bn (£183bn) worth of assets in Europe that could also be used, even though Moscow has so far refused to allow it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Russia also rejects Ukraine's bid to join Nato. That may not be too much of a sticking point as there is no likelihood yet of that happening, but it is part of Ukraine's constitution, so finding agreement will be difficult.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Membership of the European Union is also a potential sticking point, perhaps less so for Russia than for countries that are ahead of Ukraine in the queue to join the EU. Few believe it will happen very soon.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Could Ukrainians hold a vote on a deal?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Ukrainian leader has cited opinion polls that suggest 87% of Ukrainians want peace, while at the same time 85% reject withdrawing from Donbas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So he believes no decision on either the fate of Donetsk or the broader 20-point plan can be made without a popular vote and a 60-day ceasefire to prepare it: \"A referendum is the way to accept it or not accept it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This too is a potential sticking point as the Kremlin argues a temporary ceasefire would only prolong the conflict and lead to renewed hostilities - and Trump has said he understands Putin's position.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But without such a vote Zelensky believes a deal would have no validity which just adds to the list of thorny issues to be resolved.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

In a radio interview last week, he described a US operation against a \"big facility\", but provided limited details. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A US strike on land would constitute a marked escalation in the pressure the Trump administration has put on Maduro, whom the US has accused of leading a \"narco-terrorist\" organisation - an accusation the Venezuelan president has denied.  </p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since September, the US has launched 30 strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats, targeting vessels in the Pacific and the Caribbean, and killing more than 100 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The most recent strike was on Monday, with US Southern Command saying in a social media post that two \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in a \"lethal kinetic strike\" in the eastern Pacific. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the US has provided no evidence to back up its allegations that the boats it struck were carrying drugs. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">With the exception of two survivors - a Colombian and an Ecuadorean national - none of the identities of those on board have been made public. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Speaking on Monday, Trump provided little detail about the alleged strike on land, but seemed to signal that a new phase in the pressure campaign on Venezuela had been reached.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hit all the boats, and now we hit the area... it's the implementation area. That's where they implement, and that is no longer around,\" he said without clarifying which area he was referring to. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the US has previously carried out strikes on alleged drug boats - including Monday's - the Pentagon has published images and videos on social media to confirm the strikes. So far, no images of the dock incident have been shared.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has described strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific as attacks against terrorists attempting to bring fentanyl and cocaine to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, fentanyl is produced mainly in Mexico and reaches the US almost exclusively via land through its southern border.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Counter-narcotic experts have also pointed out that Venezuela is a relatively minor player in global drug trafficking. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It mainly acts as a transit country through which drugs produced elsewhere are smuggled.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cc31/live/f145b540-e505-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"Reuters US President Donald Trump attends a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (not pictured) \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Reuters</span></div></div></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As well as striking vessels it suspects of transporting drugs, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7810w37vwdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Washington has also deployed a large military force to the Caribbean</a> and ordered a naval blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil revenues to fund drug-related crime and designated the Maduro government as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organisation\" (FTO).</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In recent weeks, US forces seized two oil tankers and pursued a third one. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Maduro government, which has long accused the US of wanting to steal the South American country's oil riches - Venezuela has the world's biggest proven reserves - called the seizures \"piracy\".</p></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Ros Atkins on… the oil tanker being pursued by the US</figcaption></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nicolás Maduro has also accused the US of using its \"war on drugs\" as an excuse to try to depose him.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When Trump was asked last week whether the goal of the seizures was to force Maduro from power, the US president responded: \"Well, I think it probably would...

It also warned that Saudi Arabia would take measures to confront such \"highly dangerous\" actions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The UAE's foreign ministry denounced the allegations that it \"exerted pressure on, or issued directives to, any Yemeni party to undertake military operations that would undermine the security of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or target its borders\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It also insisted that the UAE had \"focused on containing the situation, supporting de-escalation efforts, and promoting understandings to contribute to preserving security and stability\" since the start of the STC's offensives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The head of Yemen's eight-member presidential council - which includes STC representatives - earlier announced that he was cancelling a joint defence pact with the UAE and ordering its forces to leave within 24 hours \"in the interest of safeguarding the security of all citizens, affirming commitment to Yemen's unity, sovereignty, stability, and territorial integrity\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rashad al-Alimi also declared a state of emergency for a period of 90 days, which he said was necessary to confront the Houthis and what he described as \"the internal strife led by mutinous military elements that received orders from the United Arab Emirates\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The STC's leaders said the ultimatum for the UAE's withdrawal was unilateral and had no legal basis, and insisted the UAE would remain a \"main partner\" in the battle against the Houthis.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8cd1/live/70abf310-e58a-11f0-99b0-ada9be4ed6d1.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AFP Burned-out military vehicles and pick-up trucks following a Saudi-led coalition air strike on the port of Mukalla, southern Yemen (30 December 2025)\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">AFP</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Saudi-led coalition air strike on Mukalla destroyed a number of military vehicles and pick-up trucks</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Alimi's announcement came after the spokesman of the Saudi-led coalition - which includes the UAE - said it had carried out a \"limited\" air strike on weapons and military vehicles for the STC's forces in the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla which arrived on two ships from the UAE.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The shipments had constituted \"an imminent threat and an escalation that threatens peace and stability\", Maj-Gen Turki al-Maliki asserted.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">An official at the port told AFP news agency that a warning to evacuate was received at 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT) and that an open area at the facility was struck about 15 minutes later.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pictures showed a number of burned out military vehicles and pick-up trucks in a walled-off area at the port, as well as damage to a nearby building.

She was 80 years old. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia intended to run for parliament in February, when the country will vote for the first time since a popular revolution in late 2024 unseated Hasina.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Thrust into the political limelight following the assassination of her husband, then-president Ziaur Rahman, she went on to become Bangladesh's first female PM in 1991. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her career, which included spells in prison and house arrest, was defined by a bitter feud with Hasina. She was acquitted of corruption and allowed to travel to London for treatment only after Hasina lost power. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Physicians said on Monday that Zia's condition was \"extremely critical\". She was put on life support, but it was not possible to provide multiple treatments at the same time given her age and overall poor health, they added. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Our favourite leader is no longer with us. She left us at 6am this morning,\" Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced on Facebook on Tuesday. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When news of her death broke, crowds gathered outside Evercare Hospital in Dhaka where Zia had been admitted. </p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As the wife of Bangladesh's former president Rahman, Zia was a reserved presence alongside her famous husband. When he was killed in a military coup in 1981, Zia entered politics and went on to lead the BNP in the country's first elections in 20 years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Known as an \"uncompromising leader\" after refusing to take part in a controversial election under military ruler General Hussain Muhammad Ershad in the 1980s, Zia broke through a male-dominated political landscape and transformed into one of Bangladesh's most formidable political leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her first term was widely praised for efforts to improve women's education and social development, with her government bringing back parliamentary democracy by amending the constitution with bipartisan support.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Her second term in 1996, which lasted only weeks, drew criticism for staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority — a measure parliament approved before dissolving.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia returned as prime minister in 2001, stepping down in October 2006 ahead of a general election. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the past 16 years, under the Awami League government, Zia became the most prominent symbol of resistance to Hasina's rule many saw as increasingly autocratic. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She boycotted the 2014 election after her rival Hasina scrapped the caretaker government system — a provision meant to ensure neutrality during national polls. Later, Zia was convicted on corruption charges and jailed. She denied wrongdoing and said the charges were politically motivated.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was released in January 2025, soon after mass anti-government protests in Bangladesh toppled Hasina, forcing her into exile in India. She has since been <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwvg99e8vdo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">convicted and sentenced to death</a> for crimes against humanity over her crackdown of the protests.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The BNP had said in November that Zia would campaign in the upcoming general elections. The party is eyeing a return to power, and if that happens, Zia's son Tarique Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rahman, 60, had only returned to Bangladesh last week after 17 years in self-imposed exile in London.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia had been in hospital for the past month, receiving treatment for kidney damage, heart disease and pneumonia, among other conditions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite being kept away from public life due to her health, Zia remained a figurehead for opposition forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus had called for the country to pray for Zia, calling her a \"source of utmost inspiration for the nation\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a statement on Tuesday, Yunus offered his condolences for the passing of Zia, whom he described as a \"symbol of the democratic<b id=\"\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ\"> </b>movement\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The nation has lost a great guardian... Her role in the struggle to establish democracy, a multi-party political culture, and the rights of the people in Bangladesh will be remembered forever,\" he said in a statement.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina's party, the Awami League, now banned in Bangladesh, issued a statement from Hasina on X paying tribute to Zia.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hasina, who is still in India, said in her statement that Zia's \"contributions to the nation were significant and will be remembered\", and her passing was a \"profound loss for Bangladesh's political life\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is \"deeply saddened\" by Zia's passing and paid tribute to her contributions towards the development of Bangladesh, and its relations with India. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We hope that her vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership,\" he wrote on X.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia \"a committed friend of Pakistan\", whose service to Bangladesh would leave a lasting legacy.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Zia's family members, including Rahman, his wife and his daughter, were by her side in her last moments, BNP said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,\" the party said in its statement on Tuesday.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-fan-wang\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Fan Wang</i></p></div></div></body></html>"

Sadly, Stone's career stalled in the mid-1970s as a result of drug abuse, and at one point he was reported to have been left homeless.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g2d5yz1r1o\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Read more</a></p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Brian Wilson</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dd99/live/ef26f9d0-d052-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images Brian Wilson is positioned behind a microphone stand, wearing a light-coloured shirt with a bold paisley pattern in shades of blue and gray.

Black-browed Albatross!\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The tour boat takes bird watchers from Cape Town to see endangered seabirds, including albatrosses, that are hard to find on the mainland.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's a warm summer's day and the sky is blue and clear, perfect conditions for bird-watching. The skipper is speaking on his radio - he's looking for fishing trawlers. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He soon finds one, and makes a beeline towards it. The closer the boat - operated by Cape Town Pelagics, a non-profit organisation - gets to the fishing vessels, the more seabirds appear. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As he stops right next to the fishing boat, hundreds of birds trail behind it.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They've learned to associate these boats with food. They follow the trawler, waiting for discarded fish heads and guts which fishermen throw into the sea as they sort through and process their catch.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The birds fight over the discarded pieces, occasionally diving into the nets to catch some of the fish there. But looking for food this way can cost these seabirds their lives.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They get caught on what they call long lines,\" explains Tim Appleton, a British conservationist and the founder of the Global Bird Fair, referring to a commercial fishing method that uses long fishing lines dotted with hooks to catch large fish like tuna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of these long lines that go out the back of fishing boats are 100 kilometres (62 miles) long. They have 4,000 hooks on them. Every 4,000 hooks are baited with a bit of squid or fish and of course the birds try and get the bait and end up getting caught on the hooks, dragged under and drowned.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The accidental deaths of animals by fishing boats are called bycatch. And it's not just long-line fishing that kills these birds: they also get tangled in the cable lines that pull the fishing nets up towards the boat.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Albatrosses spend almost half of their life on the high seas, making them particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b599/live/73503310-e0df-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC Seabirds fly around the fishing boats in the sea\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Albatrosses are particularly vulnerable to being injured or killed by fishing boats</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Of all of the groups of birds in the world, the seabirds are one of the most endangered,\" says Andrea Angel. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She works for BirdLife South Africa, a conservation organisation, where she leads the Albatross Task Force. For the past 20 years it has been working to stop the birds from being killed by fishing trawlers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are only 22 species of albatrosses globally, 15 of those are threatened by fishing activity. Albatrosses roam the seas and live exclusively on squid, fish and things that they catch in the ocean. So most of their lives are spent at sea, which means that they encounter fishing vessels more than any other bird.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She adds that albatrosses' mating habits also make them more prone to extinction. They mate for life and only lay one egg every two years which they raise on breeding islands. The parents share responsibility for feeding their chick. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There's a huge investment in raising that chick, and that investment is made by both of the parents. So when one of them is out following fishing vessels, if one of those parents is injured or dies, the chick back on the island will also die, because the one parent isn't enough to keep up feeding this one chick, and an investment that's taken them two years to lay an egg is completely lost.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">What's worse is that, because albatrosses are monogamous and pair for life, it takes them up to four years to bond with a partner.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once that bond breaks through the death of one of the partners, it will take them at least another four or five years to form another bond and begin the ritual of laying eggs again. So the disruption of one bird being lost at sea is tremendous.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One way to prevent the accidental death of albatrosses at sea is the use of bird scaring lines: they're essentially nautical scarecrows, scaring the birds away from the nets and fishing lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Colourful plastic streamers hang above the fishing nets and fishing lines, fluttering in the wind to stop birds from getting caught in them. Made of plastic tubing and rope, they can be cheaply and easily made.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8e58/live/8fe96860-e0e0-11f0-94d6-33dfd766fcaa.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mayeni Jones / BBC People work on a bird scaring device\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mayeni Jones / BBC</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">BirdLife is collaborating with workers with disabilities to create bird scaring lines</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BirdLife has been collaborating with disabled workers from the Ocean View Assocication for Persons with Disabilities, training them to make the bird scaring lines. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Ocean View started off as a fishing community,\" says Deborah Gonsalves, the manager of the association, which provides a daycare workshop for people with physical and intellectual disabilities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Some of our members were fishermen prior to having a disability. So to see BirdLife partnering with them has been amazing and the members have grown tremendously.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She says building bird scaring lines has been an incentive for the members of the association.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's actually enabled them to still be productive and it gives them that self-worth. At the moment, as I'm sure in most parts of the world, there is a lack of funding. The economy has taken a knock. The work they do here supplements their disability grant and it gives their loved ones the chance to work while they are being cared for.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Andrea Angel says it's not just the workers and the conservation work that benefits from the deployment of bird scaring lines on fishing vessels, there are economic incentives for fisheries too.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"We call them bird scaring lines because it's a very evocative name. It tells exactly what they do. But originally they were called tori lines. Tori means bird in Japanese. They were created by a Japanese fisherman in the late 90s, who was tired of catching so many birds in his hooks and losing his catch. Fishermen would rather catch a big tuna than a bird. A tuna is worth around $10,000 (£7,400) and a bird is worth nothing. So the economic incentive for them is huge.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But she admits that some fishermen faced with time constraints, safety concerns and fishing quotas, don't always use the lines.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They don't always put out the bird scaring lines for various reasons. And so it's always a negotiation and a reminder to them to please do so, because they really are saving tens of thousands of bird lives.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Since the Albatross Task force was set up in 2004, it's seen a 90% reduction in the number of seabirds killed by southern African fisheries. The hope is to replicate its success in other parts of the world to ensure these majestic birds can keep reproducing for years to come.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">You may also be interested in:</h2></p><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0a19/live/7c722dc0-089d-11ef-b9d8-4f52aebe147d.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Getty Images/BBC A woman looking at her mobile phone and the graphic BBC News Africa\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Getty Images/BBC</span></div></div></figure></article></div></body></html>"

It isn't only a question of what a child witnesses or survives – there is also the impact on adults.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Not only do children in war zones face the death of caregivers and traumatic separations,\" says Prof Betancourt, \"but caregivers experiencing their own trauma and distress may not be fully available to help protect and guide their children through the horrors of war.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Pluess's research among Syrian refugees supports this. Among the 80% of children found to be vulnerable to more than one psychological disorder, family circumstances were critical.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Around 1,600 families took part in a study, published in 2022, of Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Prof Pluess says that children's living conditions (such as access to safe housing, food, and schooling) were found to be \"about 10 times more predictive of their mental health\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Children who adapted more healthily may have \"had a social environment that was very protective, maybe the parents were able to shield them, maybe they had close friendships, relationships, maybe they have access to school, all those external things that sort of buffer the negative impact of war exposure.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The roots of this knowledge in Britain go back to WW2 and the experience of children who lived through the Blitz – the eight months of German air attacks between September 1940 and May 1941.</p></div><figure><div

of King's College London, points to a study of 212 children treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children during the war. When researchers went back to the children in 1949 – four years after the conflict ended – they found only 21% had recovered. The role of parents – both positive and negative – emerged as an important finding.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The severity of a child's reaction to bombing was judged to be influenced by their parents' response to the trauma either to accentuate or calm their anxiety,\" says Prof Jones.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Overcoming fear and establishing control</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In my own experience, therapy and medication helped, but also the ongoing support of family and friends. Without the power of caring relationships I don't believe I could have emerged from the darkness.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I was also encouraged to confront my avoidance of anything that might remind me of the trauma. For example, I went through a long period of avoiding travel to the continent of Africa, fearing that simply being there would trigger reminders of the Rwandan genocide. But my therapist gradually encouraged me to face the fear. It took several years but I did return, and continue to visit places there that are dear to my heart.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Prof Başoğlu pioneered the use of what is called CFBT – Control Focused Behavioural Treatment - among survivors of the 1999 Turkish earthquake, which killed about 18,000 people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The idea is to encourage the individual to take control of their fear of the event recurring. In the case of children who were constantly clinging to their parents, this was attempted by encouraging them to get used to sleeping alone.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Once they overcome their fear, all the traumatic stress reactions that are associated with fear also improve,\" Prof Başoğlu says.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Israeli psychologists working with children released from Hamas captivity after the 7 October attacks also stress the importance of re-establishing a sense of control.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0

specialists wrote that this was achieved \"by providing survivors with information and space to express their concerns while ensuring that their needs and voices are heard\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But successful interventions depend greatly on creating a stable environment where the fear of being killed or maimed is not an ever-present reality.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"What they also need is that their parents are well, that they live in a safe place, that they have access to education, that they have a routine, that they have some predictability,\" says Prof Pluess.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This is rarely certain in areas ravaged by war. Ceasefires break down. Front lines become frozen. The displaced are stuck in camps.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'We were dehumanised'</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Still, those words about a safe place bring to mind my friend Beata and the difference stability made to her life.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">She was 15 years old when the Rwandan genocide – the worst mass slaughter since the Nazi Holocaust – erupted in 1994. Up to 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, were massacred over a period of 100 days.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As a reporter I travelled on the convoy that evacuated dozens of orphaned children - Beata Umubyeyi Mairesse among them - through roadblocks manned by the murderous Interahamwe militia. It was a terrifying experience, but especially for the children whose families had been killed.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">From roadblock to roadblock, we did not know if the machete-wielding gangs would attack.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Years later when she was researching her experiences (later published in a book, The Convoy), Beata got in touch. I remember being struck by her composure and openness. She is married with two children, lives in France and is now a successful writer.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"The first thing that helped me was exile to France, leaving the scene of the genocide. I found myself safe, in a peaceful place, with shelter, a foster family who took care of all my material needs, and the opportunity to see a psychologist. I went back to school in September, and that helped me too.\"</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/36a1/live/855c5c10-dcfb-11f0-a8dc-93c15fe68710.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"VCG via Getty Images A Rwandan girl sitting on a roadside with some luggage \" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">VCG via Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 GunZh\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f6f4/live/9fe45a10-dcfb-11f0-b67b-690eb873de1b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Mirrorpix/Getty Images A group of people going about their days in Rwanda following the civil war\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Mirrorpix/Getty Images</span></div></div></figure><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2eba/live/d1a60490-dc2e-11f0-aae2-2191c0e48a3b.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Liaison/ Getty Images A child dries her face June 24, 1994 at the Nyarushishi Tutsi refugee camp on the Zaire border in Gisenyi, Rwanda\n\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA\"><span class=\"sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn\">Liaison/ Getty Images</span></div></div><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Global conflicts that have affected millions of children -

Her father had died before the slaughter.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Composed as she was, there were lingering terrors. She panicked one night when classical music was played on the radio – similar to music played on Rwandan radio the night the genocide began. Fireworks or the sound of hunters shooting sent her hiding under a desk in class \"because I thought war had broken out in France\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">I wondered if she makes a conscious effort to protect her children from the traumatic inheritance of genocide. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"There are things that are difficult to tell your children, how we were dehumanised, how I was almost raped. The term 'unspeakable' makes sense when passing on stories to children. We are afraid of contaminating them with our trauma.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But for Beata, nuance is vital. \"Their only image of Rwanda should not be the genocide. I told them stories from my childhood and every time I went there I brought them back fruit so that they could also discover a country full of flavour.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Although she lives a full and happy life, Beata still suffers from anxiety and takes anti-depressants to deal with insomnia. I also use medication, and like Beata I do not see it as a burden or a stigma. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Rather I count myself fortunate to be able to access care and medicine.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Fergal Keane (second from right) in Rwanda after the genocide</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Creating a safe community is also seen as critical by many experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"They're not just victims of mental health,\" says Prof Pluess. \"They're little people with interests and that's why they need to go to school, they need to have opportunities to play together - and that might be as important as dealing with the mental health problems that they're facing.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Psychologists working in Gaza are well aware of these needs. Davide Musardo, who volunteered with Medecins Sans Frontieres, has written of trying to provide therapy against the background of drones and explosions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"In Gaza, one survives but the exposure to trauma is constant. Everything is missing, even the idea of a future. For people, the greatest anguish is not of today — the bombs, the fighting, and the mourning — but of the aftermath. There is little confidence about peace and reconstruction, and the children I saw in the hospital showed clear signs of regression.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is possible, in devastated Gaza, that the current ceasefire will become a permanent peace, allowing rebuilding, and the restoration of family life and schooling. Possible but by no means certain. In Sudan there are attempts to re-start talks about peace but little optimism for their outcome. The war in Ukraine, and many other wars grind on every day.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trauma is as old as war itself. Politicians, journalists, and experts looking to the aftermath of a conflict often ask, \"What will happen when the killing stops?\" But somewhere else the killing will continue. That is the relentless tragedy of children caught in wars they did not start, over which they have no control. For all the knowledge gained about treating trauma, humanity is far from dealing with its root cause – war itself.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"additional-reporting-by-harriet-whitehead\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Additional reporting by Harriet Whitehead</i></p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><i id=\"top-picture-credit:-epa/shutterstock\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">Top picture credit: EPA/Shutterstock</i></p></div><figure></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/bbcindepth\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\"><i id=\"bbc-indepth\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\">BBC InDepth</i></a><i id=\"is-the-home-on-the-website-and-app-for-the-best-analysis,-with-fresh-perspectives-that-challenge-assumptions-and-deep-reporting-on-the-biggest-issues-of-the-day.-you-can-now-sign-up-for-notifications-that-will-alert-you-whenever-an-indepth-story-is-published--\" class=\"sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz\"> is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

We keep a list of named individuals whose deaths we were able to confirm using official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The real death toll is believed to be much higher, and military experts we have consulted believe our analysis of cemeteries, war memorials and obituaries might represent 45-65% of the total. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That would put the number of Russian deaths at between 243,000 and 352,000.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The number of obituaries for any given period is a preliminary estimate of the confirmed losses, as some need additional verification and will eventually be discarded.

Then the number rises in February, when  Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin talked directly for the first time about ending the war in Ukraine.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The next peak in August coincides with the two presidents meeting each other in Alaska, a diplomatic coup for Putin that was widely seen as an end to his international isolation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In October, when a planned second Russia-US summit was eventually shelved, and then in November, when the US presented a 28-point peace proposal, an average of 322 obituaries were published per day - twice the average in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is difficult to put increased Russian losses down to any one factor, but the Kremlin sees territorial gains as a way of influencing negotiations with the US in its favour: Putin aide Yuri Ushakov stressed recently that \"recent successes\" had had a positive impact.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Murat Mukashev was among those who gambled on a quick peace deal, and it cost him his life.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Mukashev (inset) signed up for the army after he was given a 10-year jail term</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Mukashev was an activist who had never supported Putin's policies. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Over the years, he had taken part in demonstrations against police violence and torture, and joined rallies for LGBT rights and the release of Alexei Navalny, the Kremlin's main opponent who died in prison in 2024.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He had repeatedly condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine on social media from 2022.
