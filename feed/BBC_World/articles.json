Organisers say it's \"the largest authentic German Christmas market\" outside the country and Austria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets are thought to have originated in Germany in the 14th Century, and its markets have long been admired since. But how close are the ones in the UK to that supposed traditional, real thing?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">BBC News visited some to find out - and perhaps provide some inspiration for your next festive visit.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">A taste of Germany... in Birmingham?</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On a cold Thursday afternoon in Birmingham, we have just met Nina Adler and Till Rampe, 27-year-old German students studying for PhDs in the UK's \"second city\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">As we walk around the Christmas market, which snakes through streets close to Birmingham New Street railway station, they're reminded of home.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They point to the wooden huts, food and drink, and the handicrafts as positive signs this is close to the traditional ideal. The chocolate-coated marshmallows at one stall impress Till, who is from a town near Frankfurt. \"I could swear they are from my hometown,\" he says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The warm lights of the Christmas market have given Birmingham city centre a festive glow</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But other aspects of Birmingham's market are further removed from the German way - like the beer. \"People are just connecting Germany with beer,\" Nina, from Berlin, says. \"In Germany usually you drink mulled wine. This is very typical.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And as for the pop tunes blaring out of the speakers in Birmingham - like The Power of Love - you probably wouldn't hear that at markets in Germany - rather it would be Christmas music and carols, she says.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Nina Adler and Till Rampe were impressed by what they saw in Birmingham</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also visiting the market with us is Katharina Karcher, an academic at the University of Birmingham. Her verdict? It's \"super authentic\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Having been set up in 1997 and running annually since 2001, the Birmingham market is organised by Kurt Stroscher, who is also director of Frankfurt's Christmas market. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He uses \"only wooden stalls and atmospheric white lights that don't blink\", with the stalls built in Germany and food and drink imported from there.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It's mostly a thumbs-up for Birmingham's Christmas market when it comes to authenticity, then - but how does it compare to one in Germany?</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Birmingham's market stretches through several streets</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Our visit to a Christmas market in Berlin</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">While many Christmas markets in the UK have been running for a couple of weeks now, in Germany they have only just opened, as is tradition, on 24 November.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Most German towns and cities have a Christmas market, with Dresden, Nuremberg and Cologne among the most famous.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These markets hold \"huge symbolic meaning\" to Germans, says Dr Karcher, who's from near Frankfurt. Along with a religious undertone, \"they are what get people through the dark time\", she explains.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Berlin Christmas market: A typical Christmas market includes large tents housing restaurants or bars and stalls selling a range of handmade gifts</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Some 800 miles away from Birmingham, the city of Berlin is home to more than 70 different, small Christmas markets. In Charlottenburg Palace in the west of the German capital, the market is bustling and filled with people of all ages when we visit on a Tuesday night.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The smell of roasted almonds, caramelised apples, chocolate-coated fruit, mulled wine and grilled sausages fills the air, as Christmas carols are performed live on a stage and children enjoy a small, sparkling Ferris wheel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The 17th Century Baroque Charlottenburg Palace is illuminated in different colours, with falling snowflakes projected onto its facade and wooden stalls in front.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">So what exactly makes a traditional German Christmas market?</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Christmas market we visited in Berlin used projections as well as fairy lights</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Typically, they may have (as this one in Berlin does):</p><ul class=\"sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm\"><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Large tents housing entire restaurants or bars</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Stalls selling a range of handmade gifts, including woolly hats, gloves, scarves, jewellery, handmade candles, wooden nutcrackers and other arts and crafts</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Traditional German foods like Lebkuchen, the German version of gingerbread often seen in cookie form, many kinds of sausages including Bratwurst, cheeses, hearty dishes like Langos (a deep-fried Hungarian flatbread with different savoury or sweet toppings) or goulash, and Spätzle</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">Mulled wine for those who drink alcohol, not so much beer</li><li class=\"sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm\">A location in a square in the Altstadt, the old part of a town. And in cities - lots of different markets in different areas</li></ul><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">To Magrita, 66, who is enjoying a mulled wine with her husband Dietmar, 69, German Christmas markets are characterised by their unique atmosphere: \"The colourful lights and Christmas decorations make it so special.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Dietmar explains how \"Christmas markets are not the same as other markets labelled as 'Winter Market' or 'Winter Wonderland,' because of the fairytale-like feeling you only get at an authentic Christmas market\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I visited a Christmas market in Milan a few years ago, and it wasn't the same, it was just a collection of different stores,\" he adds.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At another table, Anna and Karolina, both 19, are catching up over some chocolate-covered strawberries. \"Apart from the mulled wine and the food, the colourful lighting and the festive and cosy vibe are what make Christmas markets unique,\" says Anna.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But in Karolina's view, \"the star... is definitely the food and drink. [It's] what really makes a Christmas market authentic\".</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Anna and Karolina were enjoying the Berlin market</figcaption></p></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Other Christmas markets in the UK </h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Back in the UK, while Birmingham can boast about its markets authenticity, what of other locations in the UK?</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets have become a staple of many UK cities - Manchester, Leeds, Bath, Edinburgh and Newcastle among them. Smaller markets, typically in historic settings, are also proving popular on TikTok, sometimes incredibly so. Since 2023, Lincoln Christmas market has been closed because of overcrowding concerns.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">When the BBC visited the market in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, earlier this week, we saw an open mic night, including a rendition of Neil Young's Heart of Gold, and stalls selling the likes of pasta, Greek gyros and Yorkshire pudding wraps. There were also German foods and signs, though far fewer than Birmingham.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">The Berlin market was bustling with people of all ages</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Visitors didn't seem to mind though. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I quite like that,\" says Jamie Aycliffe, who was visiting the market with his wife and baby. \"We're doing our British version of the Bratwurst.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But having been to Christmas markets across Europe himself, he felt the ones in the UK were \"not as good\" and \"a bit more commercial\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Others were visiting the Kingston Christmas market for the aesthetic.  </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"It's fun,\" drama student Amelia Shannon, 22, says. \"I don't have to go to Germany for it.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Overall, though, this was not as true to the traditional thing as in Birmingham, and also much smaller in size. Some people told us they'd prefer it if UK-based Christmas markets like in Kingston's sold more small gifts from independent businesses, like German markets do.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Amelia Shannon (second from left) came to Kingston Christmas market with her friends, all drama students</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Anne-Teresa Markovic, an academic originally from Nuremberg, says she was struck  by the range of food and drink offerings being \"more prominent\" there than in Germany while visiting Christmas markets in Manchester and Leeds. She recalls seeing \"festive patatas bravas\" on the menu, which needless to say, aren't particularly German.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Christmas markets in Germany are changing, though. There's often now more international food - and Dr Karcher says depictions of the patron Saint Nikolaus are increasingly becoming more about Santa Claus.</p></div><figure><p data-component=\"caption-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf\"><figcaption class=\"sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ\">Katharina Karcher has noticed Santa Claus becoming more prominent at German Christmas markets</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The warm glow exuded by Germany's Christmas markets was dimmed during deadly car attacks on a <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59048891\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">market in Berlin in 2016</a> and in the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2l104k4vxo\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">city of Magdeburg last year</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Security has been stepped up at markets since.

He was sentenced to 45 years in prison.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump also threw his support behind conservative presidential candidate Nasry \"Tito\" Asfura in the Central American nation's general election, due to be held on Sunday.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hernández, a member of the National Party, who served as Honduras's president from 2014 to 2022, was extradited to the US in April 2022 to stand trial for running a violent drug trafficking conspiracy and helping to smuggle hundreds of tons of cocaine to the US. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He was convicted by a New York jury two years later. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Polls indicate the Honduran election remains a toss-up between three candidates including Asfura, the former mayor of Tegucigalpa and leader of the conservative National Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Also in the running is Rixi Moncada, a former defence minister standing for the ruling left-wing Libre Party, and Salvador Nasralla, a television host with the centrist Liberal Party.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump criticised Moncada and Nasralla on Friday, writing that the latter was \"a boderline Communist\" who was only running to split the vote between Moncada and Asfura.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He characterised Asfura as \"standing up for democracy\" and praised him for campaigning against Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro, with whom Trump has engaged in a war of words in recent months.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Nasralla has pledged to cut ties with Venezuela if he wins.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Trump administration has accused the left-wing Maduro - whose re-election last year was dismissed as illegitimate by many countries - of being the leader of a drugs cartel.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It used countering drug trafficking as a justification for a military build-up in the Caribbean and has conducted strikes on vessels it says have been used for smuggling - though some analysts have described these moves as a means of pressuring Latin American leaders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Honduras has been governed since 2022 by President Xiomara Castro, who has forged close ties with Cuba and Venezuela.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But Castro has maintained a co-operative relationship with the US, agreeing to preserve a long-running extradition treaty with it. Her country also hosts a US military base involved in targeting transnational organised crime in the region. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">More than 80 people have been killed in the US strikes on vessels suspected of being involved in the transport of narcotics since they began in August.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth has said the aim of \"Operation Southern Spear\" was to eliminate \"narcoterrorists\". </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But legal experts have questioned the legality of the strikes, pointing out that the US has provided no evidence that the boats it has targeted were carrying drugs.</p></div></div></body></html>"

Sister Regina was headmistress.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But the numbers of nuns dwindled.

So far, they have not been realised. If someone has a better idea than us, then that is very welcome. Unfortunately I just doubt that this time will be more successful than last time.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Putin thanked the Hungarian prime minister for proposing Budapest as a potential venue for a Russia-US summit with President Donald Trump. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"Trump immediately said: ''We have good relations with Hungary, you have good relations with Viktor, and I do too, so I suggest this option.' Of course, we happily agreed,\" Putin said.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to Reuters news agency, Orban told Putin that Hungary was \"interested in peace\" and added: \"Our meetings today give me the  opportunity to confirm, Mr President, that Hungary is ready to provide a platform for such negotiations.\"</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">However, the atmosphere when the delegations met in Moscow appeared surprisingly frosty and at one point Orban inadvertently bumped into his Russian host, after shaking hands with other members of the Russian delegation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One independent Hungarian media outlet also suggested that Putin's words had been mistranslated into Hungarian, to sound more positive.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Plans for a Budapest \"peace summit\" were proposed last month but they were shelved, reportedly because the Russian side had refused to compromise on Putin's maximalist demands for an end to the war.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Hungarian leader's Fidesz party faces parliamentary elections in April and polls suggest that for the first time in 15 years it could be defeated at the ballot box. If he were to host a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, it could help boost his chances of re-election.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Orban, who last visited Moscow in July 2024, has repeatedly challenged EU attempts to end European imports of Russian oil and gas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He billed Friday's visit as the second leg of a strategy to ensure Russian energy supplies this winter, for Slovakia and Serbia as well as Hungary.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Earlier this month in Washington, he secured exemption from US sanctions on Russian fuel - but only as long as he remains in power.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Ever since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Orban has claimed to have been on the side of peace and told Hungarian state radio last week that \"Europe has decided to go to war in Ukraine\".</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He has strongly backed Trump's 28-point peace plan to end the war and during frantic diplomacy after it emerged, the Orban government and pro-Orban media have accused EU leaders of \"war-mongering\" for trying to adapt the plan to take account of Ukraine's objections.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Joining Orban and Putin in the Kremlin were leading Russian officials, including Putin aide Yuri Ushakov, who is part of Russia's negotiating team with the US.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">In a letter this week to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Hungarian leader called for immediate, unconditional peace talks, for the EU to launch direct negotiations with the Kremlin. He stressed his opposition to further EU funds for Ukraine, and rejected the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukrainian defence.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Now, with little sign of Russian willingness for compromise on Ukraine, Orban is focusing on Russian energy. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Deals he struck in Washington to buy US liquefied natural gas and start buying US nuclear fuel mean Hungary will buy less of both from Russia, potentially annoying his Russian hosts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Orban argues that without deals with the US and Russia, heating prices would triple next month.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary is under pressure from the EU to end all imports of Russian energy by 2027 and is likely to use any agreement in Moscow to continue to defy Brussels.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hungary currently receives over 80% of its oil and gas, and 100% of its nuclear fuel from Russia, and total Hungarian trade contributes approximately $5bn annually to the Russian budget.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Like Trump, Putin has made clear he wants Orban to win next April's election, so another diplomatic \"triumph\" for Orban would serve the interests of both sides. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At this year's Valdai Forum in Sochi on 29 September, Putin praised Orban personally, and saluted \"nationally oriented political forces\" gaining ground in Europe.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"If these forces in Europe continue to grow stronger, then Europe will be reborn,\" Putin said.</p></div></article></div></body></html>"

But it could not quite close the gap between the Sudanese warring parties, and then the RSF attacked el-Fasher.</p></div><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">On face value, Bin Salman's appeal to Trump gives much more weight to the Quad plan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The US president is the one figure who could intervene with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and persuade him to change course.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The problem is that Saudi Arabia and the UAE are engaged in a fierce rivalry for influence across the Arab world, including countries such as Yemen and Syria, as well as Sudan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is a contest for who will be the leading power in the Arabian peninsula.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The two also have policy differences, especially on how to handle the Muslim Brotherhood - Saudi Arabia can tolerate the Islamists provided they do not have a leading role, whereas the UAE considers it a terrorist organisation.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Because Burhan's coalition includes Islamists, who were powerful and wealthy during the 30-year rule of former President Omar al-Bashir from 1989 to 2019, the UAE has taken sides against them.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Trump would also need to get Saudi Arabia and the UAE to push Sudan higher up their list of priorities.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">For both countries, Sudan comes below issues such as Gaza and Syria, as well as finance and commerce.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Despite his personal appeal to the US president, it is not clear whether Bin Salman offered to set aside his differences with the Emirati leader in order to make peace in Sudan.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">And Burhan appears to interpret the prince's intervention in Washington as overriding the Quad plan, not bolstering it, as it could imply excluding the UAE. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">He wants to see a bigger role for Saudi Arabia in the mediation, and the UAE shut out of it – which is a green light to intensify the war, not end it.</p></div><figure><div data-component=\"image-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM\"><div data-testid=\"image\" class=\"sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV\"><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251120-101800-81b2dab7dc-web-2.34.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" class=\"sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script\" aria-label=\"image unavailable\"><img sizes=\"(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw\" srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d4a/live/541552b0-cc57-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Reuters An injured man from el-Fasher sits on the ground surrounded by his children.

The apartments here are sold at subsidised prices, but day-to-day affairs in the estate are managed by privately appointed firms.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">According to the 2021 census, the complex was home to about 4,600 people - nearly 40% of whom were 65 or older. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The city's fire department on Thursday said firefighters faced major challenges trying to rescue residents, including high temperatures, the risk of further scaffolding collapse, and the small and crowded interiors of the apartments.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Hong Kong is well-known for its tiny, densely packed inner-city dwellings, where many public rental housing tenants have, on average, a living space of just 14.1 square metres. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is unclear how many people were in Wang Fuk Court when the fire broke out, but the more recent census figures suggest it is home to around 4,600  residents. Hundreds of them have been evacuated to temporary shelters, and some are being allocated emergency housing units.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Police are investigating whether mesh netting, plastic and canvas sheets used during renovations met fire safety standards.

But the vast country - bigger than France and Germany combined - also faces many other security challenges.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Recent attempts by US President Donald Trump and his supporters to frame the insecurity purely as the persecution of Christians overlooks the complexity of Africa's most-populous nation. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are more than 250 ethnic groups in Nigeria, which is roughly divided into a mainly Muslim north, a largely Christian south, with intermingling in the middle - and the government says people of all faiths have been victims of attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There are criminal gangs in the north-west, an Islamist insurgency in the north-east, clashes over land in central regions and separatist unrest in the south-east - leaving the 400,000-strong army and the police force of 370,000 officers overstretched.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Here's a breakdown of the main armed groups and flashpoints:</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">'Bandits'  - kidnap gangs</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">These criminal gangs, known locally as \"bandits\", are largely composed of people  from the Fulani ethnic group, who traditionally make their living by raising animals. They have traded their pastoral tools for assault rifles, which have flooded Nigeria - and other states in the region - since Libya descended into anarchy following the overthrow in 2011 of long-time strongman Muammar Gadaffi by Nato-backed forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs are not known to be motivated by any religious or political ideology, but see kidnapping people for ransom as a quick and easy way to make money rather than walking for miles with their livestock in search of water and grazing land.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">They typically move in large numbers on motorcycles, which makes them highly mobile and allows them to strike quickly and escape before the security forces can respond - a tactic used during two recent school abductions.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">There is no centrally organised leadership - each gang, often drawn from one family or a specific community, tends to be loyal to its own leader. The police have placed bounties on some of the notable leaders, including Ado Aleru and Bello Turji, and in 2022 the government designated the bandits as \"terrorists\" in a bid to stem their violence.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Aleru is from Yankuzo town - an area in the north-western state of Zamfara which has been a hub for bandit activity over the last three years.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The gangs, which sometimes fight one another, also travel to neighbouring states and central regions to carry out kidnappings. They also prey on their local communities and are indiscriminate in their ransom demands. In some areas, they tax residents.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Younger bandits, some in their teens, are increasingly taking to TikTok to show off their ransom money, guns and motorcycles - and have garnered thousands of followers.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Boko Haram - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This Islamist militant group became infamous around the world in 2014 for kidnapping more than 200 schoolgirls from the village of Chibok - around 90 of whom remain missing.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It evolved from a local Islamist sect founded in 2002 by Mohammed Yusuf in the north-eastern city of Maiduguri with the official name of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad and a political goal of creating an Islamic state. Local residents dubbed it Boko Haram - a name which in the Hausa language loosely translates as \"Western education is forbidden\" because of their opposition to Western-style schools.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its full-blown insurgency was triggered in 2009 by the killing of Yusuf who had been taken into police custody after Boko Haram clashed with the security forces.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">At one point under its new leader, Abubakar Shekau, Boko Haram controlled large swathes of territory in Nigeria's north-east - and appointed \"emirs\" to administer some areas.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Chibok girls were only a small fraction of the many thousands of women and children taken into captivity and forced into sexual slavery, domestic servitude or used as suicide bombers by the militants.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram then split into rival factions. After the death of Shekau four years ago, its strength has diminished, however it still conducts regular attacks on both civilians and security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"embed-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 djqsWD\"></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram has spawned a range of groups that use kidnapping to raise funds, focusing on soft targets such as schools, churches, mosques and remote villages where paved roads and bridges are either inadequate or absent.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Iswap - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Several Boko Haram commanders - including Abu Musab al-Barnawi, believed to be the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf - formed what became known as the Islamic State in West Africa Province (Iswap) in around 2016 as they felt Abubakar Shekau was violating Islamic doctrine by killing Muslims.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Boko Haram routinely targeted markets and mosques, often with suicide bombers. Iswap generally avoids attacking Muslim civilians and focuses on military and government targets.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\"><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/west-africa/nigeria/b196-jas-vs-iswap-war-boko-haram-splinters\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">Iswap is still locked in a violent turf war with Boko Haram</a>, with reports of deadly clashes between the two groups around Lake Chad earlier this month. In fact, Shekau is said to have killed himself during a battle with Iswap, exploding a suicide vest.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It remains active and last week killed a Nigerian general, Brig Gen Musa Uba, after an ambush in Borno state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Iswap commander Hussaini Ismaila was recently sentenced to 20 years in jail for multiple attacks in the northern city of Kano in 2012.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The north-eastern jihadist group was initially blamed for an attack on a Catholic church in the south-west of the country in June 2022 that killed at least 50 worshippers.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But prosecutors now believe it was a single cell linked to Somalia's al-Shabab jihadist group that was responsible. Five men are currently on trial for the attack and it is alleged they went to Somalia for training.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">No group has said it was behind the two recent school kidnappings in the north-west of Nigeria in Kebbi and Niger states, but the government believes that Boko Haram and Iswap are behind them, presidential spokesman Sunday Dare told the BBC.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But it is a claim disputed by some experts.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">\"I don't think that's accurate. There is no Iswap or Boko Haram cell resident in the north-west. The recent kidnappings, including the mass abductions, were carried out by bandits,\" conflict analyst Bulama Bukarti told the BBC.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ansaru - Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This splinter group has moved away from the north-east, where Boko Haram and Iswap dominate, to carry out its operations. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is believed to have participated in the 2022 attack on a high-speed train travelling between the capital, Abuja - in the centre of the country - and the city of Kaduna, about 200km (124 miles) north, in which at least seven people were killed and more than 100 commuters were abducted for ransom.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Its leader, Khalid al-Barnawi, was arrested in 2016 and is facing trial over several attacks, including the 2011 bombing of the UN building in Abuja. His trial is scheduled to resume in December 2025.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Mahmuda - suspected Boko Haram splinter group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Believed to be a breakaway faction of Boko Haram, it has set up in rural areas around Kainji Lake National Park in the west of the country since around 2020.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It is linked to the Islamic State group and has emphasised more moderate messaging in comparison to Boko Haram and proselytises in Hausa and other local languages to attract recruits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The group has carried out targeted killings, often riding in on motorcycles and attacking markets, vigilante groups set up to protect villagers from bandits and local communities in the western state of Kwara. In April, its fighters killed several vigilantes and attacked a market there, killing Fulani men and others.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Their recent focus has shifted slightly north of Kwara - to Niger and Kebbi states - areas long plagued by bandit violence, where the two recent school abductions occurred.</p></div><figure></figure><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Lakurawa - jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A relatively new Islamist militant group, Lakurawa has been attacking communities in Sokoto and Kebbi states in the north-west and in Niger, the country which borders Nigeria to the north.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The authorities say it maintains ties with jihadist networks in Mali and Niger, and members have settled among border communities, marrying locally and recruiting young people.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Initially presenting itself as a protector against the bandits that roam the north-west, the group has gradually imposed harsh controls - such as checking villagers' phones for music, which is banned as it is considered un-Islamic, and flogging offenders.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It was declared a terrorist organisation in 2025 and accused of cattle rustling, kidnapping for ransom, hostage-taking and attacking top government officials.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">JNIM - Sahel jihadist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Active mainly in Mali and Burkina Faso, where it controls large areas, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), may be making inroads into Nigeria.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">A confirmed JNIM attack in northern Benin early in 2025 occurred close to the Nigerian border. In October 2025, the group claimed what would be its first attack inside Nigeria, in Kwara - the same state where more than 30 worshippers were abducted from a church last week and which has also seen increasing incursions by bandits.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">If JNIM activities are confirmed, it would complicate an already dire situation in parts of the country where Ansaru, Lakurawa, Mahmuda and the bandits are all active.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Herders v farmers - battles over resources</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">This long-running conflict in central Nigeria - also known as the Middle Belt - has devastated communities, fuelling displacement and the spread of small arms as both herders and farmers arm themselves for what has become a deadly cycle of reprisal attacks.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">It has been framed by some as a religious fight, but the central grievance is over grazing rights - access to land and water.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The herders are mainly Fulani Muslims, while the farmers are largely Christians from various ethnic communities, although some are Muslim. Fulani families traditionally walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find land for their prized cattle. </p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">But urbanisation has seen encroachment onto these age-old grazing routes and locals accuse the Fulani of letting their cattle trample their crops and forcing them out of their homes and fields.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">Notable clashes have taken place in Kaduna, Plateau, Nasarawa, Benue and Taraba states. In order to try and curb the violence, some state governments have imposed anti-open grazing laws and set up ranches for the herders - but have faced resistance from all sides.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">One fallout from the conflict is the establishment of ethnic militias that, in some cases, have turned to criminality, plundering the people they ostensibly claim to be protecting. Ethnic Tiv militias in Benue have been accused carrying out mass killings and some of their leaders have been killed or arrested by the security forces.</p></div><p data-component=\"subheadline-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD\"><h2 class=\"sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb\">Ipob - separatist group</h2></p><div data-component=\"text-block\" class=\"sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT\"><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The separatist violence in the south-east has its roots in calls for Biafran independence that <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-51094093\" class=\"sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc\">date back nearly 60 years to the brutal civil war that led to the deaths of up to a million people</a>.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">That rebellion was crushed but demands for an independent state for the Igbo people of the region continued as some Igbos continue to feel that they are marginalised by the Nigerian state.</p><p class=\"sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA\">The Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), led by Nnamdi Kanu, is one of the groups promoting that call for secession.
