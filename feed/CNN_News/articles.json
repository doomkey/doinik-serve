In a powerful Republican majority such holdouts could be ignored. In McCarthy’s narrow majority – secured after a 2022 midterm election that fell short of GOP expectations – they have real leverage. And Democrats have little incentive to help McCarthy out in the event of GOP defections since they’d presumably have to vote for huge cuts that Biden has opposed in any final GOP bill. And the speaker probably couldn’t risk using Democratic votes anyway after agreeing to a rule, as he battled to win his job, that lets any single member call a vote on his ouster.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-c03214ba23b1a358b2e7c9236226bcfd@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The coming showdown over the debt ceiling is potentially the defining moment in the two-year period of uneasy cohabitation between the Democratic president and Republican speaker.

Plenty of economists worry about the always ballooning national debt, which has crashed through $31 trillion.

So when First Lady Jill Biden visited the city to attend a vigil for the shooting victims of the Covenant School, it was an absolute given that a country music artist would be there.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Will the circle be unbroken?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              By and by, Lord, by and by.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              This is Ketch Secor, founding member of the Grammy Award winning band Old Crow Medicine Show. I didn't even get an introduction at the vigil, but that's because everyone in the crowd already knows who he is, not just a famous musician, but a member of their community and a parent of two school aged kids. In fact, the school his kids attend in East Nashville, he co-founded it in 2016. It's called the Episcopal School of Nashville.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              So I'm wearing two different hats here when a school shooting happens in our town. It's both as a parent and it's as somebody who's on the other side of the pick up line as well. When a country singer gets off the road, chances are at 8:00 in the morning on Monday after the big weekend, that guy or gal is in line dropping their kid off at a school in Nashville, Tennessee. When it comes to your home, it's different.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And the sky lowered in the sky.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Ketch Secor recently wrote an op ed for The New York Times that caught our attention. It was titled Country Music Can Lead America Out of its Obsession with Guns. In it, he calls for country musicians to speak candidly to their audiences about gun culture. I wanted to have him on the show to talk about that op ed, like, can country music really help lead the U.S. out of a gun debate? And what are the stakes for a musician in the genre if they actually take a stand? And what's it like to live at the center of it all as a parent, educator and musician in Nashville, Tennessee? This is the assignment. I'm Audie Cornish.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              The shooting at the Covenant School kind of prompted you to write an op ed for The New York Times. But can you take me back to that day a little bit? Where were you when you heard it happening?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Sure it was on Monday, two weeks ago, and it was at 10:13 in the morning. I got a text message from our school attorney saying, I'm so sorry, and I had no idea what was going on. And prayer hand emoji is interesting.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              So getting an emoji like that or getting the obligatory \"are you okay\" that we all start to send each other now when there's a shooting, especially at a school, you're saying it it hits you in a place of what? Panic. Fear. What? What do you feel?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              It's. It's all the above. It's. It's your kids. It's someone else's kids. You know, the head of school was murdered. The connections between our school are very present, and it's as a community member in Nashville, this shocking realization. Oh, this thing that happens in other towns has come to our town. And it's come not just to our town, but to our children, to our the place that is most sacred.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And even to your corner of that world, Right? Like it didn't happen at a public school. It didn't happen at a big university. It happened at essentially a small Christian primary school. Right. Which is what you what you founded one, right? It had connections.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Yeah. And our schools are very different in that regard and serve different populations. However, it you know, we're all the same. We are all every school, public, private, charter, every stripe is in the business of believing that kids are our future and must be stewarded and loved on and guided. And, you know, that's a real elemental principle for me.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Can I ask, how old are your kids and do they go to the school you founded?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Yeah, they do. And they're nine and 11.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              So did the school you founded this Episcopal school, did it go into lockdown? Kind of what what did you you all have to do as a result?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              No, the schools adjacent to Covenant did, but the others in Nashville did not. And so the thing I think that was so sad that first day was the message that went out saying your children have not yet been notified. The staff knows, the teachers know, everybody knows, all the parents know, everybody knows but the kids. And we're going to talk about it tomorrow. But we wanted to give you the chance to talk about it first. So if you can imagine a pick up line, anybody who's who's been through a school shooting in their community knows, you know, the pick up line that first day is full of tears.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Right. And for people who aren't familiar with how big ups and drop offs work these days in schools, there is a line right, where like there are kind of they are chaperoning your kid the literally to the curb and you pick them up. There's not just like wandering out of the building where I think if you were a kid in the nineties is what you grew up with. Yeah, it's hand to hand pass off.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              That's right, Audie. You must have kids.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Well, the juxtaposition of kids full of vibrant joy and life and parents full of grief and sadness coming together. This meeting to me was very powerful.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Meaning you're standing on the curb waiting to get your kid. But every parent's face is just drawn.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And every parent is looking at every teacher and just, you know, holding back tears as is every teacher. But every child continues to feel very safe. And yet we all know as parents that no child is safe any longer because this tragedy is in our backyard. It's come to Nashville, it's come to us, to our kids.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              I guess I want to start maybe with Wagon Wheel, because if people go to look you up, that might be the first song they learn about. And you even write about it in this op ed. Tell me a little bit about where you were in your career when you wrote this.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Sure. Well, Wagon Wheel is my most successful song.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Headed down South to the Land of the Pines.

I wrote it when I was about 17, going to school up in New England in a prep school called Exeter, and I was had just learned to play the banjo up there.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              So rock me mama like a wagon wheel.

And you mention this specifically, and I want you to talk about why.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              When you make the kind of music that I make with a fiddle and a banjo and harmony singing and a particular style of songwriting, you're engaging in a community that might be different than your own sort of background, and it's not. Well, there's a train going by right now. This is sort of evidence..\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              I remember the train. Yeah.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              The trains are always going by in Nashville.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Just got to keep it going on the podcast. It'll add a little bit of color and speaks to what I'm talking about. You know, the trains are going by. The trucks have NRA stickers. You know, when I was a kid, there were Confederate flags everywhere. This is The South, y'all. It's different than the other parts of the country now, for better or for worse. But it is what it is.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And when you're around Nashville and you have political conversations, wherever the person falls on the spectrum, inevitably someone uses that phrase, Well, this is The South.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Like, that's supposed to cover a lot of things.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Yeah. And whether it's supposed to be that way or, you know, I think we're in a state of considerable growth down south, but the vestiges remain, and they're important to talk about in this regard, because one of the vestiges is gun culture, and it's largely considered like the rebel flag in the past, just something that exists here. Deal with it, y'all. When in fact, we have always had the power to drop the rebel flag. There's one vestige that has been challenged effectively.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And effected change in one way, or at least raise the kind of societal stakes engaging in certain language.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Totally. And so I see the change in gun culture is just like another step towards The South's evolution.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              To my mind, country, Americana, these genres so closely align with their audiences. It's very much like hip-hop, like people in hip-hop talk about the culture and their ties to the music, and the music ties to quite literally the identity of the people listening. And country feels very much the same way. But as a result, it has a lot of like rules. You know, there's a couple lines you they people don't like you to step out of. Can you talk about how that plays out in modern country?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Sure. Well, today's country singer might not come from The South and is college educated. So that they're in has already changed the stereotype of who sings country music. You know, it's it's not coal miners anymore. The coal miner's daughter like we all love Loretta, but that's not who's on number one right now. So that part of it has changed a lot. But what hasn't changed so much are the attitudes of the audience.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Which to be clear. The country music audience also is wealthier and are decision makers and our often managers, there's been sort of like a lot of research into many people who are in the audience, and the audience probably looks a little different than people expect as well.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Well, I didn't know to go into this, but but I'm excited that we are, Audie, because, you know, country music really especially, and to clarify, contemporary country music on the radio is a real safe space for us to not talk about political divisiveness and not talk about things of of substance. But instead we're all sort of reading the Pulp Fiction together. And it's it's\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Which is why it's popular, right? I mean, during the pandemic, I heard the growth of listening to the music or streaming maybe was up 15%. It was higher than any other genre.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              People welcome that safe space.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Travel story. It's you know, it's very much stories, intergenerational family tales. That's the kind of stuff that goes number one is the song about grandpa and what a good guy he was and how if we could be a little bit more like him, then the world would be a better place. So this sort of, you know, hallmark kind of these ideals that are tossed around might not be that realistic for today's reality of, you know, I worked I'm part of a global economy working two jobs. And, you know, I'm hoping my kids are going to go get out of state tuition or whatever. And yet we country music really deals in nostalgia. And that nostalgia is a an important antidote to all of the pain that one can witness in the click of a mouse.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Right. So how does gun. Culture interact with that nostalgia, storytelling, because you're saying in a way that that's built into the music, too.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Johnny Cash singing I Shot a Man in Reno to Watch Him Die. Hank Jr Singing about. Yeah, I'd like to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye and shoot him with my old 45 because a country boy can survive. This is a way to for country music to retain authority in a changing world. And guns--\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              But do you hear it in the modern music? Are there? You don't have to pick out any artist. But do people still talk about that?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              No, Audie. And that's the thing. We don't talk about guns. If we do, it's a song about I took my boy hunting for the first time. It's again, dealing in the nostalgia. What it's not saying is I've got an AR-15 in my collection. But the reality is that many, many listeners do. And yet it's a safe space where they are not confronted by the music to a changing reality. Instead, they are allowed to say, I taught my child how to, you know, I mean, when I was a kid in the eighties, like I went bird hunt with Dad, I learned how to fire a weapon. I learned how to clean a weapon. These things are important to the ways that gun culture can be a positive, but the safe space is that we're not talking about what it means in today's America.

What do we not care about kids at all? It's just over. So this is my way of saying it's not over and it won't be over until those deaths, those three deaths of American children gunned down in the third grade, until they mean something, that's when it'll be over.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              More with Ketch Secor in just a moment.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              You are demanding a new kind of movement come out of the south.

This sounds like an uphill battle.

First thing I want to say is that changing segregation was an uphill battle in Tennessee. And and when Nashville in the early 1960s, in the late 1950s said its first foot forward, this was the proving ground, other parts of the South were too unsafe. But people gathered in Nashville, a city of colleges, a city of progressive thought in the South to engage in nonviolent civil disobedience. This is where John Lewis came. This is where the Freedom Riders first stop was.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Their trainings, right, with James Lawson and at Vanderbilt.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              All of that training at Fisk and Vanderbilt happened right here in Nashville, Tennessee. That shows our ability as a as a community to exist outside of the state. Now, just like in that time, the state legislator said, what are you talking about? That's not going to happen in our state. We cast the deciding vote on on women's suffrage. I mean, Tennessee has been a bellwether place in these two other instances of great significance. This is the third. This is the part of the death knell of the old South, which is going to have to change. You know, 50 years from now I think we're going to be looking back at these couple of years as the deciding time for a assault weapons ban in the United States.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Again, I want to bring it to the question about country music artists, especially mainstream ones who given what we know about the music, number one, have been socially punished for activism by what we call Music Row, by music radio, by country music radio in particular, which still has a very kind of strong grip in a way programmers do, and even recent history. Right. When you think about the Dixie Chicks, etc., their whole story is a story of being ostracized for their activism.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              You know, for a guy like me, I'm not beholden to too many people at all, but I'm not a mainstream.

And I'm asking them through this piece and also face to face in my community, through conversations of text.

If you get a sec, please take a look.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              What's been the most positive response? What's been the most frustrating one?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              The most frustrating one is silence. I say in the op ed piece that I think silence is complicity. I went into the studio and I and I recorded a new song on the subject. Since the shooting, which is only two weeks ago there have been so many ways to be engaged with this terrible story, and it's powerful solution.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              I mean, the reason why I'm asking is because your op ed said something pretty specific, right? That there are artists who are tired at being at the kind of mercy of the whims of fearmongers, you said, and that they're ready to speak to an impressionable audience. And because other genres, like we mentioned hip hop earlier or pop, they do wade into societal issues. They can be confrontational about politics. It's not like there isn't a model out there. So I guess what would it take, do you think, for people in your industry? To start to do something similar, which is which is, in effect, what you're calling for.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              It is beginning and it's, I think, in its infancy, but it's already started.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              And so it's about fanning the flames and building a big bonfire out of what's already crackling kindling. For example, we've got a benefit concert here in Nashville that supports Covenant School. And when you look at the the roster, who's on the marquee, it's not the usual Americana folks who always say, you know, we stand with kids, we stand up against gun violence. Instead, it's number one chart toppers. They are there. They have put their hat into the ring.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              But is it because it's is it going to be a safe space from politics? If it's a moment of a memorial, is that what makes it okay for a big artist to be there? Right. Because nobody's going to get up and say we should have gun control.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              There's nothing but up here because we we have started at the very baseline where music coming out of Nashville on the radio says nothing about violence against children in our schools or about the need to rethink the types of weaponry that is associated with the Second Amendment. Kelsea Ballerini talked about it on an award show. These are the kinds of things that when somebody takes one step and the movement can quickly follow it, then the next step isn't as hard to make. And what I'm asking for is that next step. You know, I've gotten a lot of feedback from my audience. And like I say in an op ed piece, you know, I see the NRA sticker on the back of lot of trucks blaring in my tunes. So, you know, and we're out on the road with Hank Jr. this summer. So, I mean, I'm I'm used to playing to an audience that is our country folk. But I love my country folk audience. And I and I want to be able to be real with them. I can move freely in both of the spaces that the two big silos in the country. Like, I might go to work in one silo and come home and the other one. And I'm good with that because I love those people.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              What is your message to those artists who are just still very reluctant?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Country music has a great destiny in these times to swing out past the fences that have corralled it in so tightly. That I believe in this genre. And I believe that it has the power to carry that truth. You know, it's very much rooted in a gospel tradition of of the lamentation, the calling out to the great spirits. Help us, Lord. We're just your children. We don't know shit. We're we're dying down here. Help!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Can you talk about the song that you've written out of this moment?\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              New material? You know, generally, just like I'm in a songwriting mood here, I'm in a a moment in time with a lot of different opportunities as a writer to engage on this, whether it's, you know, writing the right caption for a photograph on Instagram or writing an op ed piece for The New York Times or being on this podcast with you, Audie. There's so many ways to choose my words right now and try and have them be resonant for the pain that we're feeling in Nashville, Tennessee and around the country because we are just so tired, parents, that our kids are not safe in their schools. What that means for me as a songwriter is that I also have the chance to write new music about this and to put my money where my mouth is. So I got a new song that's coming out called Louder Than Guns. That's yeah, I just recorded it two days ago.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Give me a sense of the tune or lyrics.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              Well, gosh, I feel like I shouldn't even brought it up because it's so...anytime you get a you know, people are cagey about their new stuff!\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        \n          \n        \n          <div class=\"transcript-clip-container\">\n            \n            <p class=\"clip-script\">\n              You're dealing with a dude that wept through the whole songwriting process.

As an heiress and an investor, we should not be paying lower tax rates than people who earn their money from working. \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-c02af8ac9cf1f74708bcabf426490967@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            It’s time for the tax code to treat all income equally by taxing all capital gains over $1 million at the same rates as ordinary income, and replacing our loophole-ridden estate tax with a simpler inheritance tax that treats inherited wealth as income. \n    </p>\n\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-5c47b6e665b79affd7a35f84d53f29f4@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            We can’t just focus on income, however, because many of the richest Americans earn basically no taxable income of any kind in a typical year. Capital gains are only taxed when assets are sold, so instead of selling them, the ultra-rich use their assets as collateral to borrow vast sums of money at extremely low interest rates to live on, and then declare little or even negative “income” on their tax forms. This “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/26/opinions/billionaires-tax-a-good-start-mccaffery/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy, Borrow, Die</a>” strategy is a major reason billionaires paid a <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/article/forbes-400-pay-lower-tax-rates-many-ordinary-americans/\" target=\"_blank\">lower effective tax rate</a> over recent years than working-class families. \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-73edb9bc4b9cecb453b2c0be14f55059@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            By rethinking what is taxable, we can get access to the trillions of dollars of billionaire wealth that is untouchable under our current tax structure. That’s why President Biden has proposed the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/03/28/presidents-budget-rewards-work-not-wealth-with-new-billionaire-minimum-income-tax/\" target=\"_blank\">Billionaire Minimum Income Tax</a>, which would tax the unrealized capital gains of the wealthiest households and why others have proposed wealth taxes on billionaires. \n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-2cfaa6077149d4c79511b272fa06749b@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Finally, one of the most straightforward changes needed is to simply tax the extremely rich more than the merely rich. Our <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2023\" target=\"_blank\">income tax</a> caps out at a top rate of 37% for any income over $578,125 (or $693,750 for married couples). No matter how much more someone makes, they’ll never pay more than 37% in federal income taxes. \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-e7a59ac09211bbafbfb7dd64a2edad6f@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            While someone earning $600,000 is certainly making enough to live a very comfortable life, they’re in a different world than someone making $600 million a year. In order to reflect the real differences between the rich and the ultra-rich, we need to return to the <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-highest-marginal-income-tax-rates\" target=\"_blank\">top rates</a> we had through the most prosperous decades of the 20th century and add significantly more tax brackets. They should reach up to 90% for people making more than $100 million a year.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-ca6e8eee6362df3e85b1c9827eeb63e4@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            These three changes certainly won’t fix all our country’s problems on their own, but they would go a long way in stopping the steady flow of our country’s wealth toward a smaller and smaller group of people, a change that would make both our democracy and our economy more stable. The tax code can be a powerful tool for both social and economic change. We just need to use it more effectively.\n    </p>\n\n              </div>\n                            </div></body></html>"

There’s no end to sex scenes and other steamy content featuring the young and unwrinkled, but past a certain age, popular culture largely draws a blank — or treats sex as a punchline. \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-9a31a8d06b2c90f4b74f157766810993@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Last year, the artist Marilyn Minter set out to change that, gathering a group of men and women aged 70 and older in her New York studio to showcase a lesser-seen side of sex and relationships. In erotic and colorful images, the seniors are stripped down to lingerie or briefs; they hug, kiss and caress each other in the heat of the moment. The photographs beckon our attention to challenge something still seen as taboo, showing playful, loving moments of pleasure.  \n    </p>\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-13250f2fed5b61e186fa0c2d34e144da@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            “There’s so much contempt for elder sex.

And that was my goal — to make to make them look very desirable.” \n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-588d120afc3d56f4b38a971adc1032f4@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            A handful of the ensuing images were originally published in the New York Times Magazine, accompanying a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/magazine/sex-old-age.html\" target=\"_blank\">candid editorial feature</a> about seniors’ sex lives. Minter is now publishing the series in full in the forthcoming book “Elder Sex,” and exhibiting them at New York gallery LGDR. The exhibition, <a href=\"https://lgdr.com/exhibitions/view/marilyn-minter/\" target=\"_blank\">which opened in April</a>, is her first solo show in the city since the Brooklyn Museum mounted her retrospective “Pretty/Dirty” in 2016, and features highlights from her five-decade-long career, as well as other new bodies of work. \n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-3607e9095347eefec8cab6fa66ad8ab5@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            In “Elder Sex,” Minter utilized one of her signature aesthetics, which she has explored in both hyperrealistic paintings and photographs: jewel-toned, close-cropped compositions of glistening bodies, seemingly shown through the glass of a steamed-up mirror or window. But despite her credentials as one of the most important and boundary-breaking artists today — and despite stars such as <a href=\"https://www.marilynminter.net/photos-4/gaga\" target=\"_blank\">Lady Gaga</a> and <a href=\"https://www.marilynminter.net/photos-4/odalisque\" target=\"_blank\">Lizzo</a> posing for her — Minter couldn’t find enough real couples willing to participate. \n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-71b93d58cf8a7322d023eb0b1d8c236e@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            “We wanted to (include) all races, all types of sex,” Minter explained. “We had a lot of trouble getting models. I’m 74. I asked all my friends — in mixed-race relationships, in lesbian relationships — and none of them would do it.” \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-b8e60b9c101445287e341b0fcc57b611@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            In the end, Minter cast actors along with the few people who had agreed. She paired them together in her studio, photographing them behind a panel of frozen glass — a trick to achieve the steamy, wet look without battling the ephemerality of water vapor. During their shoots, Minter said all her models, who were as old as 89 years old, told her they still had regular, enjoyable sex lives. Their sentiments matched the people interviewed for the New York Times Magazine article, who described deepening intimacy with their partners later in life, as well as learning to navigate and appreciate their needs as their bodies aged. \n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-71ffd1fb737c2787ede69c9ddd4d4e5e@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Minter believes there’s a sense of freedom in sex later in life that, for many people, can take time to reach. \n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/paragraph-8844fb0cffcc792158ae1473251239b3@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            “When you’re young and having sex, it’s a little more performative than it is when you’re 80,” she said.

She pointed to photographs in People magazine comparing the characters of  “The Golden Girls” and “Sex and the City,” who are the same age at the time of the latter’s reboot on HBO Max (which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros.

Out of the attachments, the Tushy Classic 3.0 had the most comfortable stream by far, and its adjustable nozzle made it much easier than others to get a thorough clean. While it’s a bare-bones bidet, you still get a solid range of pressure and directional adjustability so you can find what feels right for you. With attachments in general, I found myself using low pressures, as their streams felt more aggressive than their electric counterparts.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdk001j3e6idl71cuwu@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The Tushy Classic was relatively easy to install, and the clear instructions are simple to follow, even if you’re not particularly handy. However, when installing any bidet, the most important aspect is ensuring it’s compatible with your toilet. You should also find the water connections and try removing your toilet seat beforehand so you know how everything works. Luckily, the Tushy Classic fits all two-piece toilets and most one-piece toilets (more on this below). If you’re still not sure if the Tushy will fit your specific toilet, you can find more about Tushy’s compatibility <a href=\"https://hellotushy.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and even browse through its searchable list of toilets <a href=\"https://hellotushy.com/pages/compatibility-list\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdk001k3e6igwx0bi2r@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            While I love the Tushy attachment, there’s one big caveat: I found that the method used to supply warm water to the Tushy Spa — and all the other hot-water bidet attachments I tested — wasn’t effective.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdk001l3e6iv1zrbi1v@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Since a toilet only has a cold water supply, to get warm water with a simple attachment like the Tushy, you have to hook it up to your sink’s hot water supply. There’s no internal heater, so your water temperature is completely dependent on how quickly your sink’s water gets hot, and even then, you still have to flush out the water that’s been sitting in the hose before you get a warm wash. For that reason, I recommend you get the Tushy Classic over the Tushy Spa and avoid attachments altogether if you want to use warm water. If you prefer a heated wash, consider upgrading to a full bidet seat, like one of our top picks, the <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-cloud-heated-bidet&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Tushy Cloud</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S4646QQ?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=d9e1d79e2786dc9b5ba46c39e8346730&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Toto Washlet C2</a>.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdk001m3e6irf89q4hy@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?subId1=1109bestbidets&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Fclassic-affordable-bidet\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Tushy Classic 3.0</a> is a fantastic bidet for beginners and a decent value. Of course, you could find a much cheaper option for $30 or $50, but no other bidet attachment was as comfortable to use as the Tushy. It has a gentle yet effective stream, simple installation and easy-to-use controls, along with adjustable pressure and direction. However, if you want more features such as warm water, a heated seat or a dryer, you’ll have to shell out some more cash, but trust me, it’s worth it.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0qzsnp900003b6n5vdtkn25@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            While bidet attachments are a cheap way to see if you like bidets, I think most people will be happier with a more feature-filled seat with useful functions like warm water, a heated seat and a dryer. The best bidet seat I tested with all those features was the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S4646QQ?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=d9e1d79e2786dc9b5ba46c39e8346730&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Toto Washlet C2</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000s3b6nuvc8qs32@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The Toto C2 stood out among its competitors for one reason: comfort. Almost no bidet I tested could match its comfortable yet effective wash-and-dry experience, which is why I think it should be the first bidet you invest in.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000t3b6nubbscrv0@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The spray of the Toto C2 uses an aerated wash that gave me the best cleaning experience out of the bidets I tried. The oscillation function on the Toto was a great way to get a fuller, more thorough clean, and it also features a front wash and pulsating feature, although I didn’t find the pulsing function to add much to the experience.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000u3b6n12iln2d6@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Beyond being effective, the Toto’s stream was by far the most comfortable I tested, with a thick but gentle spray that adjusts to specific levels so you can find just the right pressure. The adjustability of the Toto’s stream is also stellar, with small but noticeable differences between each level that help you find your perfect setting.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000v3b6n2cr9xmnw@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Once you’re done with your wash, the dryer on the Toto C2 — just like its spray — is best in class. It felt the most comfortable, with a wide, even dry that helped me cut back on toilet paper use. Plus, you can adjust the dryer between three heat settings to find what’s most comfortable for you.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000w3b6nbm54bjbc@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            On top of an extremely comfortable and effective wash, the Toto also has some extra features that aren’t must-haves but make your bathroom experience all the more luxurious. One of these functions is a pre-mist feature, which turns on automatically when it senses someone sitting on the seat and sprays a mist onto your toilet bowl to lubricate the surface, which helps keep it clean. The deodorizer is also automatic, activating once you stand up to help your bathroom stay fresh. Other bidets also have features like these, so while they’re nice, you’ll probably find them on most other bidets you shop for at this price point.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4n000x3b6nc71adhwf@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            All the controls for the Toto C2 are found on a mounted sidearm. They’re quite straightforward to use, but you might need to read through the manual first to understand how to get to all the different settings. If you want a remote for extra convenience, or you’re worried a bidet with an arm won’t fit in your bathroom, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TOTO-SW3084-01-Electronic-Elongated/dp/B08S473TPS?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=58379916ab8c5943202cff6b56774f2c&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Toto Washlet C5</a> is the same as the C2 but features a remote and added user profiles for $50 to $100 more.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0y3itdx00013b6p8g0hi304@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Even though remotes sound nice, I actually like bidets with sidearms better because you don’t have to worry about where the remote is or replacing batteries, and sidearms often have buttons that are labeled, unlike remotes. Bidets with remotes are also typically more expensive, so saving money by purchasing a sidearm bidet is a better value for most.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4o000y3b6nnvm843yk@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The Toto Washlet C2 was also quite easy to put on my toilet, and while you have to replace your seat entirely, I was surprised to find that installing electric bidet seats isn’t much more complicated than installing bidet attachments like the Tushy. However, since you’re taking off your existing toilet seat, be sure to figure out if your seat is <a href=\"https://bidetking.com/pages/bidet-toilet-seats-buyer-guide\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">round or elongated</a>, and buy the corresponding bidet (more on this below).\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4o000z3b6n7i2oj1p7@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            One of the only real cons to the Toto C2 is how it heats its water. It uses a tank to store warm water for a wash, but if you use all the water in that tank, the temperature drops back down to the tap. Other bidets, like our value pick the Tushy Cloud, have technology that provides endless warm water, which can be critical if you like longer washes or if multiple people are using the bidet back-to-back. The <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-cloud-heated-bidet&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Tushy Cloud</a> and our previous value pick, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167JC6IQ?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=f3103093a2d9f15b91772e49aaac59fc&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha JX,2</a> both have this technology, so read on to see if they’re right for you.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm70tqgbw00003b6rxuca8a7g@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The other main downside of the Toto C2 is the size of its seat. The tank takes up a lot of room, which means if you have a round toilet, the available sitting space is smaller than most other bidets I tested. I didn’t have this problem with the elongated version, but if you’re a larger person with a round toilet, you might want to consider the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0167JC6IQ?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=f3103093a2d9f15b91772e49aaac59fc&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha JX2</a>.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm0r0kn4o00103b6nxtwp0yfp@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            If you want the advantages of a full bidet seat instead of just an attachment, the Toto Washlet C2 is the bidet for you. It’s filled with the most useful features and provides a wash so comfortable and effective you’ll wonder how you ever relied solely on toilet paper.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8b12psf00003b6rnquk1r0w@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Tushy released a slew of new bidets in late 2024 and early 2025, but one stood out above the rest: the Tushy Cloud. This bidet strikes the perfect balance of features and performance, giving you the three most impactful features — a heated seat, a heated dryer and endless warm water — for $359.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8c9fuv800003b6q84bi56f4@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            This bidet was so good that it nearly dethroned the Toto from our top spot. It has everything you want from a bidet and a stream so comfortable, it rivals the Toto. So, why didn’t it win? Unfortunately, the Tushy Cloud is only available in an elongated version, so folks with round toilets are out of luck. However, if you do have an elongated toilet, this is absolutely the bidet you should buy.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8c9lss200023b6qh3kuthbh@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            What truly blew me away about the Tushy Cloud is its level of features for the price tag. Bidets that cost $500 or more often tout fancy extras like night lights, lids that open automatically and user presets, but the one feature that makes the price jump the most is coil-heated water. This technology allows the bidet to heat water that runs through the seat without a tank. That means your wash will be pleasantly warm right when you push the button and stay warm for as long as you want. Plus, since the Cloud doesn’t have a tank, it doesn’t look as bulky on your toilet and has more available space to sit than bidets that have to store water.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8c9xylc00053b6qckidf7y9@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            In previous versions of this guide, the Alpha JX2 was our pick for the best value bidet for a similar reason. It has coil-heated water for a price that won’t break the bank. However, the Tushy pushed the JX2 out of the winner’s circle this year thanks to its superior comfort. The stream of the Tushy Cloud is seriously comfy, and it’s one of the only seats that came close to the Toto in this department. Its lowest setting is comfortable for beginners, while its highest is powerful without feeling painful or sharp. Outside of the Toto, I haven’t found a stream as comfortable as this one.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8catmas000b3b6qni6y1weg@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Another great feature of the Tushy Cloud is its adjustable oscillation. Many other bidets I’ve tested have some sort of oscillation, but the Tushy Cloud (along with the <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-cloud-plus-bidet-seat&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Cloud+</a> and <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-aura-luxury-bidet-seat&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Aura</a>) is the only bidet I’ve tested with multiple levels. The first level of oscillation feels like other bidets I’ve used, but the second level covers an even wider area, so you’ll never have to scoot back and forth to ensure a good clean again.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8cb34ck000l3b6qgrl1csy0@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The Cloud has a sibling in the <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-cloud-plus-bidet-seat&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Tushy Cloud+</a>, and they’re nearly identical bidets. The biggest difference is that the Cloud+ comes with a remote instead of a sidearm. Like with the Toto bidets, I think saving money and buying the bidet with a sidearm is the better choice. The Cloud’s side panel has lights for settings like temperature and pressure, which the remote of the Cloud+ doesn’t have, so I think the arm is easier and more intuitive to use.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm8cafhsj00083b6q9r200bcn@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The Cloud is also equipped with a dryer with three different heat settings. The dryer isn’t as powerful as the one on the Toto, so I found I had to sit and wait a bit longer.

These have a sleeker look and are easier to take off and clean). These attachments are the cheaper option, but you sacrifice a lot of comfort. For one, I found the stream in all the attachments I tried to be much harsher than any of the electric bidet seats I tested. Plus, as I mentioned before, bidet seat attachments don’t have internal electric heaters, rely on hot water from your sink and, in all the options I tested, didn’t get noticeably warm during the time I spent washing.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002b3e6iaznb0agh@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            If you want predictable, adjustable heating and more control over the stream, you’ll have to upgrade to an electric bidet seat. Electric bidet seats cost more, but for the investment, you get a big upgrade in experience. The streams are gentler and more effective, the water actually gets warm and you get other technologies like a heated seat and — my favorite feature — the dryer.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002c3e6ijl6pt88h@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Electric bidet seats with a good dryer are a great purchase because they not only give you a better experience on the toilet, but if you use the dryer after your wash, you also end up using less toilet paper, which is great for the planet and your wallet. I expected to use less toilet paper with all the bidets I tested, but quickly found that bidet attachments leave you needing to pat dry, which often takes just as much toilet paper as you’d normally use. For that reason, if cutting back on toilet paper is a big motivation for your bidet purchase, I’d recommend getting one with a dryer.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002d3e6idnsj7awe@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Now, electric bidet seats vary in price due to the wide range of features and technologies available. Typically, tankless units (that use a coil heater to provide unlimited hot water) are more expensive than those that use a reserve tank to store enough hot water for a single use. Most bidets with endless hot water will cost you somewhere around $500, though one of our top picks, the <a href=\"https://hellotushy.pxf.io/c/1442537/857557/11973?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhellotushy.com%2Fproducts%2Ftushy-cloud-heated-bidet&amp;subId1=1109bestbidets\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Tushy Cloud</a> and one of our previous picks the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ALPHA-BIDET-Elongated-Operation-Stainless/dp/B015GC6SAC?th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=1109bestbidets-20&amp;linkId=a9b802d7f31e1f697522b53dea1645ab&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Alpha JX2</a>, come in a couple of hundred dollars cheaper, making them a great buy.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002e3e6it6aneuez@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Once you know what sort of bidet you want, ensure it fits on your toilet. In general, the first thing you’ll want to check is if you have a one-piece toilet or a two-piece toilet. A one-piece toilet has no separation between the bowl and the tank behind it, whereas a two-piece toilet has a gap between those two elements. All bidets will fit a two-piece toilet (you will need to check the bowl shape, but more on that in a second), but some one-piece designs don’t leave enough room to fit an attachment. So if you have a one-piece toilet you’ll want to make sure you don’t have one with a French curve (where the frame of the toilet between the bowl and the tank curves up), and you should always measure the space between the bowl and the tank to ensure it matches your desired bidet’s requirements.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002f3e6ilzdg37nf@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            If you want an electric bidet seat, you’ll have to measure your bowl to see if it’s elongated or round. Most come in varieties to fit both, so you’ll want to ensure the bidet you purchase fits correctly. To see which measurements are which, check out <a href=\"https://bidetking.com/pages/bidet-toilet-seats-buyer-guide\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">this compatibility guide from BidetKing</a>.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002g3e6iqodsj95i@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Installing bidets, both attachments and full seats, is surprisingly simple. You don’t have to be particularly handy and only need a screwdriver and maybe a wrench. Most instruction manuals are quite clear, but it’s important to note that for all bidets, you’ll have to remove your existing toilet seat. With most attachments, you’ll put the seat back on, but with electric bidet seats, you’ll mount the bidet onto your toilet and remove your old seat and lid. It’s good to check out how your current seat mounts beforehand, as some lids have a quick-release function, while others screw off, so be sure you know how yours works, as it could affect your installation.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckvqwstdu002h3e6iij0ymnb6@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            If you go into the shopping experience knowing exactly what kind of toilet you have and what kind of bidet you want, it’s much easier to find the perfect one for you.

Take off your existing toilet seat and clean the bowl. If you have a bidet attachment, simply put it on the bowl, then reattach your toilet seat on top of it. If you have a full bidet seat, you’ll have to screw in a mounting bracket and slide the seat on. The bidet will come with a T-valve and some hoses that you’ll need to connect to your existing water connection (making sure everything is screwed down correctly is the most important step to prevent leaks. Use plumber’s tape if you need to). Once all the hoses are connected, slowly turn the water back on, wait 10 to 15 minutes and check for leaks.

The first, nitrogen, is what you might typically think of when you think of compost, food scraps! We call them ‘greens.’ Other green materials include green leaves, coffee grounds, eggshells and other materials that were once living,” says Lopez. “Next is carbon, or what we call ‘browns.’ Browns include mulch, dried leaves, sawdust, newspaper clippings and brown paper towels and bags.” Along with greens and browns, Lopez says compost also needs oxygen and water to keep the organisms that break down your food alive and well.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckyc1lmrc00143f6j433hr9kv@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            “Once you understand these elements, you will simply collect your greens, add them to your compost system and layer browns over the greens each time,” Lopez says. “This is called ‘lasagna composting,’ due to the layering.” Lopez says you should turn and water your compost regularly, and your pile will start to shrink as the composting process begins.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cluire5li006m3b6iec41nzyw@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Lopez says the compost will have a moderate temperature of 65 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit in the first few days as the organisms begin to break down easy-to-digest materials. After a few weeks the temperature will rise to 130 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit as harder-to-digest materials are broken down and finally, after six to eight weeks, the decomposition will slow down and your compost will be finished. Lopez says to watch for a dark brown color and an ambient temperature of about 80 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit to know your compost is complete.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckyc1lmrd00163f6j0ggwhrgz@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            While you’re composting, you’ll want to monitor the system to make sure it has enough of each of the four elements. Lopez says any problems that arise can most likely be solved by adjusting your ratio. “Pile isn’t heating up? Try adding more greens or turning more often. Getting odors or pests? Add more browns,” she says. “Composting is a natural process and is all about creating the right environment for organisms to live and do their jobs breaking down the organic material.”\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckyc1lmrd00173f6j8acgmcxt@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            However, depending on what method of composting you use, this ratio can differ. “It’s always dependent on the system. Every system has its own rules and that’s why you’ve got to know what you’re making and how you’re making it,” Rebecca Louie, master composter and author of “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Compost-City-Practical-Composting-Small-Space/dp/1611802202?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=0113compost-20&amp;linkId=2237e8659c019e501cccfe67d7e420b9&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored\" target=\"_blank\">Compost City: Practical Composting Know-How for Small-Space Living</a>,” says. “Someone’s not going to hand you a Cuisinart and then you’re gonna use it like a pizza stone.

The big difference between bokashi and normal compost is that you’re not done after you toss your food scraps into the bucket. With bokashi, once the waste is fermented you need to bury it in the ground so it can fully decompose. Although it’s a bit more work, Louie says bokashi is a great option because you can decompose all sorts of things that you wouldn’t be able to in normal compost like meat, bones, oils and candy.\n    </p>\n\n\n\n\n<div data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/product-offer-card/instances/cluiqilhc002p3b6iqfb68f99@published\" data-component-name=\"product-offer-card\" class=\"product-offer-card \" id=\"i-kito-2-gallon-food-grade-bucket-with-easy-airtight-spin-off-and-spin-on-lid\">\n\n        \n        \n            <p data-editable=\"description\" class=\"product-offer-card__description add-spacing\">You can buy bokashi starter kits, but if you have a couple buckets and some time, you can easily make your own.

Before you throw it in your bin, carefully read the label because it might not actually be compostable in your system. “Compostable plastics are designed to decompose in industrial facilities at extremely high temperatures,” Lopez says. “Many paper-based products are often coated in a grease-resistant synthetic liner. Compostable plastics and paper products contain PFAS, a group of ‘forever chemicals’ that never fully break down and contaminate the environment, causing chronic health issues. Only products made from pure wood, bamboo, palm leaf or PLA do not have PFAS.”\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/ckyc1lmsp003d3f6jgxi9qvb3@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Now that you’re ready to compost, you’ll probably want a few more supplies.

Cooking with the silicone baking mats, which — praise the powers that be — are dishwasher-safe, makes Bratskeir confident that whatever food she’s making will not be contaminated by what’s left on the sheet. Plus, the mats will help keep the baking sheet from getting dirty.\n    </p>\n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cl24xa7dc000l3e6r81pg0wh0@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The silicone sheets are rated to withstand oven temperatures up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit and are safe in the freezer too.

But we believe these are worth the purchase because they so drastically cut down the need for single-use sheet liners. They can last for years too.

If you already have a silicone baking mat but aren’t sure if it’s high quality, he gave us a trick to check before you use it again: “Lower-quality mats may contain plastic fillers that release odors or smoke. Bend the mat, and if you see white streaks, it’s a red flag.” He also told us food-grade silicone should be labeled as BPA-free, LFGC- or FDA-certified. Other features to keep an eye out for are a reinforced mesh core, temperature resistance up to 428 degrees Fahrenheit, and dishwasher-safe and stain-resistant labels.\n    </p>\n\n  \n\n    <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9it2dio00003b6oafague75@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            The following FAQs were answered by food scientists Zachary Cartwright and Abbey Thiel.\n    </p>\n\n  <div data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/accordion/instances/cm9itf7hm000m3b6oy1imr126@published\" class=\"accordion\" data-editable=\"settings\" data-component-name=\"accordion\" data-article-gutter=\"true\" data-hide-collapse-all='data-open-exclusively=\"\"'>\n    <p class=\"accordion__collapse\"></p>\n  <div data-editable=\"items\">\n        <div data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/accordion-item/instances/cm9ith90k000o3b6ob9c0awqi@published\" class=\"accordion-item\" data-editable=\"settings\" data-component-name=\"accordion-item\">\n  <button class=\"accordion-item__title-container\" data-editable=\"title\" aria-expanded=\"\">\n    <h3 class=\"accordion-item__title\">\n        Are silicone baking mats safe?\n      <span class=\"accordion-item__title-icon\">\n        <svg class=\"icon-expand\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Expand\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" clip-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M21.334 6.297c-.654-.498-1.6-.34-2.169.252l-7.149 7.438a.022.022 0 0 1-.033 0l-7.142-7.43c-.573-.597-1.528-.759-2.183-.254-.81.623-.873 1.833-.187 2.546l8.28 8.614a1.722 1.722 0 0 0 2.498 0l8.28-8.614c.687-.716.622-1.93-.195-2.552z\"></path></svg>\n\n        <svg class=\"icon-collapse\" role=\"img\" aria-label=\"Collapse\" viewbox=\"0 0 512 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path d=\"M233.4 105.4c12.5-12.5 32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3s-32.8 12.5-45.3 0L256 173.3 86.6 342.6c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3l192-192z\"></path></svg>\n\n      </span>\n    </h3>\n  </button>\n  <div class=\"accordion-item__content\" role=\"region\" data-editable=\"content\">\n          <p class=\"paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph\" data-uri=\"cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9itjn1f000v3b6obtsfdns5@published\" data-editable=\"text\" data-component-name=\"paragraph\" data-article-gutter=\"true\">\n            Cartwright and Thiel noted that silicone baking mats are safe for cooking and baking as long as they are made from food-grade silicone. “This type of silicone has great thermal stability,” Thiel said. “Always make sure the product is made of FDA-approved silicone.

         Felder’s work is challenging, in the sense that there is often an ideal wish-list selection for a song during a certain moment in each script, which then might change either due to something

         “I’m such a huge fan of ‘Yellowjackets’ and this era of music, and this song especially had a huge impact on me growing up, so I was thrilled to be asked to interpret it in a ‘deeply
