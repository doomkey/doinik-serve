Jordan Crook, a partner at the firm (and former TechCrunch employee), said the new fund will focus on agents, native AI interfaces, and application-layer AI. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Around these themes, we will continue to do straight seed investing and the Betaworks Camps,” Crook said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fund III will seek to invest in at least 25 pre-seed to seed investments, as well as make at least 50 investments into startups as part of the Betaworks Camps program. “Thus far, we’ve done around 37 deals,” Crook said, adding that the average check size was around $500,000. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crook called the current fundraising environment “frothy” for startups, and “spiky” for funds, but she noted that Fund III saw many of the firm’s previous limited partners returning to invest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The fundraising environment in venture was challenging in 2024, and we weren’t exempt, given that we were upsizing our fund,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Betaworks previously raised a $46 million Fund II in 2020, and a $48 million Fund I in 2016. It launched in 2008 as a venture studio, and has since become a staple in the New York City tech ecosystem, launching its Betaworks Camps program in 2016. The firm’s other notable investments include Tumblr and Kickstarter. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Los Angeles-based Nevoya came out of stealth last year with the ambitious goal of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/21/nevoya-wants-to-break-the-ev-truck-adoption-logjam/\">breaking the EV truck adoption logjam</a>. Nevoya made enough progress on its goal to attract investors — and a $9.3 million seed round — to help it move even faster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The young company, which buys electric trucks and offers them to shippers, is now carrying goods for 10 different Fortune 500 companies. More importantly, it’s offering services as a carrier to those companies in California at cost parity with similar-sized diesel trucks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a noteworthy accomplishment, especially at a time of increasing anti-EV headwinds – fueled by an administration that has publicly criticized green energy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founder Sami Khan is unfazed. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The idea of lowering carbon emissions is still attractive to the Fortune 500s, Khan told TechCrunch. Khan said he also believes Nevoya is just running a much faster, leaner, and better carrier business than legacy operators – in large part by leveraging AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nevoya applies AI to optimize trucking routes, and matching and balancing loads with the right trucks to maximize efficiency while minimizing energy consumption. The company also uses AI to help sort out charging schedules and battery management. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we started running the trucking business,” Khan said, “we looked at what [everybody was] doing, and we meticulously looked at every minute-by-minute of what was going on. We came to the conclusion that 90% of what was going on could be automated or semi-automated.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan said Nevoya’s automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya’s customers. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-go-big-funding-conundrum\">The ‘go big’ funding conundrum</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan expects to keep growing this model thanks to Nevoya’s new seed round – a fundraising effort that was initially much more conservative.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Late last year, with a pre-seed round in the rear view mirror, and some early traction building Nevoya’s all-electric trucking fleet, Khan found himself weighing options for how to grow his company: Do an inside round with existing investors? Or go bigger?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s when Khan spoke with Shawn Xu from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://lowercarbon.com/\">Lowercarbon Capital</a>. Xu had introduced Khan and co-founder John Verdon (the former business development head of Waymo) and had followed Nevoya closely, but had not yet invested. Xu’s message was clear: go for it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[Xu] basically said, like, no, no, no, do a big round now. We’re going to lead it, and we’re going to run with it,” Khan said. “It was, really validating, frankly, to have an investor that in the first round said ‘we’re going to sit on the sidelines,’ then come in and preempt the next round.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowercarbon ended up leading Nevoya’s $9.3M seed round, which just closed, Khan told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Floating Point and LMNT Ventures also joined, along with existing investors Third Sphere, Stepchange, and Never Lift. Qasar Younis, the founder and CEO of buzzy self-driving AI company Applied Intuition, also invested.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That funding will go towards expanding Nevoya beyond California into new states like Texas. The company is already hauling freight in Houston and Dallas. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-texas-expansion\">A Texas expansion</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That will help Nevoya generate more revenue, though Khan was quick to point out that there is a lot of work to be done in these new markets before they can also reach cost parity with diesel trucks. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That involves workarounds like charging the trucks overnight at stations typically meant for passenger vehicles, or at school bus depots when the chargers aren’t in use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Khan framed this as a win-win. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. He said the plan is to ultimately invest in building out more dedicated charging infrastructure. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. Nevoya is hiring general managers that will run their own locations like a startup-within-a-startup.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That kind of competitive element of pitting these incredibly smart, talented general managers against each other is really, really effective in driving that next level of performance for the business,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Xu said he initially held back from investing in Nevoya because he wanted the company to prove it could hit that cost parity with diesel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to understand the appetite and validation from the market,” he remembered thinking. But, he said, he also felt that “a business like this must exist.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “what would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/applied-intuition-raises-600-million-as-it-pushes-further-into-defense/\">Applied Intuition’s Younis</a> in the round).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re getting lower cost per mile. They’re getting lower maintenance costs. The AI orchestration for efficiency on the route optimization is starting to bear fruit,” he said. “So yeah, we ended up raising a much larger round that ended up being even more oversubscribed than we had expected. And now we’re off to the races.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "time": "2025-07-22T13:00:00",
            "imgUrl": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/lucid-tesla.jpg?resize=1200,900",
            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owners of the Lucid Air sedan will be able to charge their luxury EVs at thousands of Tesla Supercharger stations in North America starting July 31, nearly two years since the automakers reached an agreement. But there is a notable caveat: Lucid Air vehicles won’t be able to charge as fast as Tesla vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid said on Tuesday that all Lucid Air sedans, regardless of model year, will be able to access Tesla’s network of fast chargers with an approved adapter that costs $220. Tesla V3 (and above) Supercharger stations are compatible with the Lucid Air adapter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the Air will only be able to charge at 50 kW, a far lower rate than the 250 kW peak rate that these Superchargers provide. The issue stems from a mismatch between Lucid’s 924-volt charging system and the 400V Tesla Superchargers. Lucid, and any other EV with 800-volt charging systems, simply can’t charge as fast as they might with chargers designed for them, as <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hybrids-evs/tesla-superchargers-open-to-other-evs-what-to-know-a9262067544/#:~:text=Because%20Tesla%20chargers%20are%20rated,at%20chargers%20designed%20for%20them.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Consumer Reports</a> notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid spokesperson Andrew Hussey explained that engineers repurposed hardware in the Air’s integrated charging system, called Wunderbox, to make the system work and activate 50kW boost charging when using a Supercharger. He added that Lucid views the 50kW charging for Air as another option for owners who are on roadtrips, or live or work closer to Superchargers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike the Lucid Gravity SUV, which launched earlier this year, the Air is still built with the Combined Charging System (CCS). The CCS was considered the go-to EV charging standard in North America and used by all automakers, with one notable exception. Tesla developed its own charging standard, which includes the built-in charging port on the vehicle as well as an EV charging connector. In 2022, Tesla shared its<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/11/tesla-opens-its-ev-connector-design-to-other-automakers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> EV charging connector design</a> in an effort to encourage network operators and automakers to adopt the technology, and help make it the new standard in North America.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla calls the standard the North America Charging Standard, or NACS. In May 2023, Ford became the first automaker to reach an agreement with Tesla that would give its EV owners access to the Supercharger network. Existing Ford EV owners would use an adapter to use the Tesla network. But Ford — and soon nearly every other automaker, including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/08/gm-follows-fords-lead-and-adopts-tesla-chargers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GM</a>, Rivian, Honda, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/mercedes-benz-adopts-teslas-nacs-charging-standard/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mercedes</a>, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota — also agreed that its future EVs would have the NACS charging port built into its vehicles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid was among the last companies to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/06/lucid-adopts-teslas-charging-standard/\">strike a deal with Tesla</a>. And like the others, Lucid announced that its next EV, the Gravity SUV, would have a built-in NACS charging port. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The startup has raised more than $100 million in venture capital to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lumotive CEO Sam Heidari told TechCrunch that the startup saw a lot more demand for participating in the round than he initially predicted. While the company had turned away some investors, he said it made sense to open it back up for ITHCA Group and Amazon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Amazon, it has a lot of strategic value for us,” Heidari said. “We do appreciate the relationship more than the money.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lumotive’s Light Control Metasurface solid-state chips are made up of nano-scale pixels that can be controlled electronically to bend and manipulate light. These chips have a variety of use cases, from autonomous vehicles sensing their surroundings, offering a smaller more cost-effective alternative to Lidar, to optical switching in places like data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It is a paradigm shift of being able to manipulate the light electronically,” Heidari said. “Being able to shape the light, to stir the light, to form the beams the way you want it, to focus the light electronically. We are able to, basically, do what mirrors and motors do today, to work around the lights.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2018, the company started selling its chips in 2024, and says it has purposefully kept its list of customers small and focused.

AI agents often struggle to make decisions by themselves, hallucinate frequently, can’t cooperate with other agents, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18878\">fail at confidentiality awareness</a>, and integrate poorly with existing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Industry pioneers like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-cofounder-andrej-karpathy-keep-ai-on-the-leash-2025-6\">Andrej Karpathy </a>and Ali Ghodsi have said that, like the deployment of autonomous vehicles, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/when-ai-automation-replacing-humans-databricks-ceo-ali-ghodsi-2025-6\">humans need to be in the loop</a> in order for agents to succeed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A startup called <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.mixus.ai/\">Mixus</a> wants to address that with its AI agent platform that not only keeps humans in the workflow, it also lets users interact with agents directly from their email or Slack. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re meeting customers where they are today,” Elliot Katz, Mixus’ co-founder, told TechCrunch. “Where is every person in the workforce today? For the most part, they’re on email. And so because we can do this through email, we believe that’s a way we can democratize access [to agents].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Mixus works reliably, it may solve a big problem in the AI agent space. Most AI companies today either give you a pre-built assistant, à la ChatGPT or Gemini, or developers have to build custom agents using frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or crewAI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixus launched in beta out of Stanford only in late 2024, but it has already raised $2.6 million in pre-seed funding and brought on some customers, including clothing store chain Rainbow Shops, as well as others across finance and tech. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says its biggest selling point is ease of use, from how it helps you create agents to how you can interact with them. Users can use text prompts to set up their agents within Mixus’s platform via a chat function, or by simply emailing instructions to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"mailto:agent@mixus.com\">agent@mixus.com</a>. Then Mixus will build, run, and manage single- or multi-step agents directly from the inbox. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, a customer support manager may use a prompt that reads so: </p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Create an agent that finds all open tasks in Jira in project mixus-dummy, and send me a report with information on all tasks that are overdue.

The agent identified and gathered technology news and trends, analyzed the information to identify potential story angles, and compiled a research report summarizing the findings. At the last stage, the agent was directed to send the information to Katz for verification. Once approved, the agent would send the completed research report to Magzimof. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders noted that humans can be in the loop as much or as little as required — Magzimof said organizations can set up company-wide rules, like ensuring an email gets checked by a human if it’s being sent outside the company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing other colleagues into the workflow is as easy as tagging them in the chat with an AI agent, or copying them on the email to the agent. That’s another standout compared to agents on the markets today: Most models are single-user, and while Notion AI and Slack allow users to collaborate in shared spaces, they don’t let the AI manage conversations and tasks between teammates in real time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another core feature of Mixus is its ability to remember files, chats, prompts and agents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We created Spaces so that every team, every person, every group of people can have a shared memory,” Magzimof said. “Then all my agents, all my files, all the people can be in that very specific Space’s memory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While ChatGPT and Claude both support memory, their enterprise plans don’t yet support shared agent memory across users.  </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-else-can-mixus-do\"><strong>What else can Mixus do?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In our interview, the founders ran through an hour-long demo showing a range of use cases and abilities. Mixus’ agents do seem capable, reflecting a high degree of autonomy and memory that places the company towards the higher end of the AI agent spectrum. That is, <em>if</em> the product works as reliably as it did in the demo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other agents, Mixus can integrate with other tools, from Gmail to Jira, and users can trigger agents to run immediately or on a schedule. Agents can run and edit documents or spreadsheets inline — similar to ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, but those are often limited to sandboxed environments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mixus also lets agents autonomously navigate organizational context — like figuring out who in an organization owns a task by looking through Jira tickets. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Built on a combination of Anthropic’s Claude 4 and OpenAI’s o3, Mixus agents also have access to the web, which Magzimof says can be tapped for tasks like live research or monitoring. He described it as “Google Alerts on steroids.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Taken together, Mixus appears to be less of a productivity tool and more like a tireless digital colleague – yet another ambitious attempt to reimagine AI as a collaborator. If it works as advertised, your next “coworker” might not be human, but it might get through your inbox faster than you do.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: This article was updated to reflect how much Mixus has raised to date. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

And in a market with this level of uncertainty, the difficulties are compounded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Everyone has to go through fundraising, and it’s a relatively challenging market right now,” Kyle Teamey, managing partner at <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.racap.com/planetary-health\">RA Capital Planetary Health</a>, told TechCrunch. “That’s good for a bit of empathy.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Teamey and his colleague Brigid O’Brien, also a managing partner with the firm, know this as well as anyone. They just closed a $120 million fund, their first for RA Capital Planetary Health.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/ra-capital-planetary-health-profile/\">two years the team was fundraising</a>, the market changed course dramatically. When they started, the ink was barely dry on the Inflation Reduction Act, and global trade was humming along. All of that changed in the past six months.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“All of this is cyclical,” O’Brien said. “Kyle and I have often talked about this, and thinking about our careers and the highs and lows of the market that we’ve gone through multiple times.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Both have seen their share of ups and downs in the market. O’Brien started out as an investor at In-Q-Tel and BPH, the mining giant. Teamey, for his part, was a founder in the first clean tech era over a decade ago before becoming an investor at In-Q-Tel and Breakthrough Energy Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, the pair have developed a rubric that helps them decide where to place their fund’s money.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have three screening criteria,” O’Brien said. First on their list is time to market. How quickly can a prospective company begin generating revenue? “We saw a lot of success in companies, even seed stage companies that were able to do that,” she said. “We look for companies that can be in-market in less than five years.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Second, they look at product market fit. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We really want to have some sense that they’re building something that people actually want to buy,” Teamey said. “A common mistake among entrepreneurs is the ‘if you build it they will come’ mentality.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lastly, Teamey and O’Brien look for companies that use the money they have efficiently. “How fast can you graduate from venture capital?” O’Brien said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For many investors, the answer to those questions is usually “software,” though it doesn’t always have to be. “There’s a lot of things that are different,” Teamey said, though he adds that one common misconception — that deep tech startups aren’t capital efficient — doesn’t add up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Capital efficiency can actually be somewhat analogous [to software], but the capital intensity is often very different,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s part of why the company will write first checks with figures in the hundreds of thousands all the way up to $10 million, with rounds ranging from seed to Series C. “The name of the round doesn’t really matter, right? What matters is, what’s your time to market and does their return profile fit our strategy?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">RA Capital Planetary Health has written checks to Koloma, which is prospecting for geologic hydrogen, and AM Batteries, which has developed a new lithium-ion battery manufacturing process that promises to slash costs dramatically. AI-enabled recycling startup Sortera also made the cut, as did solar power electronics company Optivolt and energy retailer Bia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a wide range of sectors, and the choices were informed by market maps the RA Capital Planetary Health team has been assembling over the last couple of years. The maps help the team “understand what matters most in a market, what are those adoption barriers, and then what companies can overcome those adoption barriers,” O’Brien said. “It also helps us inform what are the average time-to-markets.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That detail is top of mind for the team as they navigate the current downturn in the market. “This won’t be the first time or the last time there will be a cycle,” O’Brien said. “It’s not always going to be like rocket ships.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s pluses and minuses of every part of the cycle,” Teamey added. “If you can figure it out now, you’re going to crush it as the markets get better.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s best known for a drone that has a robotic arm that can change its own batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it also has a robotic guard dog service called DroneDog. Asylon takes the famed Boston Dynamics robot dog Spot and modifies it for guard work and to integrate with its command-and-control Guardian software. Asylon offers the drones, dogs, and software as its robotic security-as-a-service (RaaS).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A site can be secured with ground patrols via robot dogs and flying cameras that cover more areas than stationary cameras. DroneDogs <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l2QIIpeXSs\">can be sent to places unsafe </a>for humans or real dogs. And they can perform almost dog sniffing-like tasks such as detecting gas leaks or dangerous chemicals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company, which was founded in 2015, hasn’t raised much venture capital prior to this compared with other drone and robotics companies. It previously raised about $21 million, plus some government grants, bringing its total raised to about $45 million, founder CEO Damon Henry told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Henry described fundraising as hard, after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, companies have increased spending <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/s-p-500-chiefs-turn-to-bodyguards-home-security-as-risks-grow\">on CEO home and facility security,</a> such as DroneDog. Its RaaS can cost about $100,000 to $150,000 a year — akin to hiring a human bodyguard service.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I went to an event last summer, a New York Tech Week event, and I happen to have met every investor that’s in the round at that event,” Henry said. When he decided to raise, he already had warm intros with investors who were aware that security spending is rising.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Henry and his two cofounders, Adam Mohamed (CTO) and Brent McLaughlin (COO), were dorm roommates at MIT. But unlike the classic Silicon Valley story, they did not drop out. They went to work as aerospace engineers after graduation for companies like GE Aviation, Boeing, and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2015, the three friends saw Amazon announce its drone delivery service and were inspired. They quit their jobs and founded Asylon. By 2019 they had their first customer: Ford.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And in 2021, the startup almost suffered a swift death. Ford had agreed to let them do a live demo event showing how their drones worked at its facility. A group of Fortune 500 had signed up to see the demo, Henry recalled. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The night before the event, the drone crashed and was destroyed. Henry saw his company flash before his eyes: a ruined reputation. No customers. The end.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A dedicated employee drove all night to deliver another drone, but the founders had precious little time to get it running. Miraculously, they did, and it worked flawlessly during the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The system flew consistently, perfectly all day long,” he said. “It won us our next three customers — Fortune 500 customers. And then the same day simultaneously, we actually won our first DoD contract for the drones.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The founders have been carefully growing the company ever since. Asylon now employs 65 and has systems deployed in 15 states, he said. <br></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

State-of-the-art, or SOTA, is a term often used in the AI field that represents the industry’s best performance to date on a specific task.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have computational ways of assessing how good the designs are,” he told TechCrunch, adding that a high percentage of proteins the model creates will be viable when tested in the lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s foundational biology model, known as LatentX, enables academic institutions, biotech startups, and pharmaceutical companies to design novel proteins directly in their browser using natural language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LatentX goes beyond what’s found in nature, creating entirely new molecule designs like nanobodies and antibodies with precise atomic structures. This approach can help develop new therapeutics at much faster rare.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to design entirely new proteins is what distinguishes LatentX from the AlphaFold, according to Kohl.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Alpha fold is a model for protein structure prediction. So it allows you to visualize existing structures, but it doesn’t, it doesn’t let you generate new proteins,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast to AI-driven drug discovery companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/xaira-an-ai-drug-discovery-startup-launches-with-a-massive-1b-says-its-ready-to-start-developing-drugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Xaira</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/29/ai-enabled-drug-discovery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Recursion</a> or DeepMind spinout <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/alphabets-ai-drug-discovery-platform-isomorphic-labs-raises-600m-from-thrive/\">Isomorphic Labs</a>, which focus on developing proprietary medicines, Latent Labs’ business model involves licensing its model for use by external organizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not every company is in a position to build their own AI models, to have their own AI infrastructure, and to have their own AI teams,” Kohl said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While LatentX is available for free, Kohl said the company intends to eventually charge for advanced features and capabilities as they’re introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies providing open-sourced AI foundational models for drug discovery include Chai Discovery and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/evolutionaryscale-backed-by-amazon-and-nvidia-raises-142m-for-protein-generating-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EvolutionaryScale</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Latent Labs is backed by Radical Ventures, Sofinnova Partners, Google’s Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei and Eleven Labs CEO Mati Staniszewski.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

I believe it’s a very impactful contribution, both personally and for the company, to make AI computing more sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With M&amp;A (at least from Meta) off the table, Paik declined to specify if the startup is now in pursuit of fresh funding. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3029827\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1200,767 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1280,818 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=720,460 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=900,575 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=800,511 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=668,427 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=587,375 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=966,617 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=708,452 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Paik says this new partnership will lead to business possibilities far beyond South Korea. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“LG AI’s EXAONE is regarded as the leading sovereign AI model in South Korea. It won’t be used just within LG. It will be one of the main AI models used in the Korean AI ecosystem. We expect there will be many demands for this EXAONE, as well as for our chip solutions in South Korea, but not only in Korea. The LG team is also partnering with and doing business with global customers. So, we also expect this to be used by those customers, including global customers,” Paik said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LG AI’s decision to adopt Furiosa’s AI chip and accelerator is notable for another reason: it’s one of the few public endorsements of a rival to Nvidia by a major enterprise, Paik said. One major reason for the win is that the startup’s hardware costs less. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had to prove that our solution not only delivers strong performance but also lowers total cost of ownership,” Paik said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FuriosaAI claims that its RNGD accelerator outperformed competitive GPUs with LG AI Research’s EXAONE models, delivering 2.25 times better inference performance. Paik also says that LG found the FuriosaAI hardware was more energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furiosa’s chip is not a general GPU but was built exclusively for AI. “We can support a wide variety of AI models efficiently. But unlike GPUs, which are still fundamentally general-purpose processors, our architecture is natively built for AI computing. We do not develop our chip for rendering or mining,” Paik said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Seoul-based startup, which also operates an office in Santa Clara, has a global team of just 15 employees.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

AI companies are competing fiercely for the public perception of being ahead in the AI race: an intangible battle of “vibes” that can have big implications for securing top AI talent. A lot of AI researchers come from backgrounds in competitive math, so benchmarks like IMO mean more than others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google scored a silver medal at IMO</a> using a “formal” system, meaning it required humans to translate problems into a machine‑readable format. This year, both OpenAI and Google entered “informal” systems into the competition, which were able to ingest questions and generate proof‑based answers in natural language. Both companies claim their AI models correctly answered five out of six questions on IMO’s test, scoring higher than most high school students and Google’s AI model from last year, without requiring any human-machine translation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In interviews with TechCrunch, researchers behind OpenAI and Google’s IMO efforts claimed that these gold-medal performances represent breakthroughs around AI reasoning models in non-verifiable domains. While AI reasoning models tend to do well on questions with straightforward answers, such as simple math or coding tasks, these systems struggle on tasks with more ambiguous solutions, such as buying a great chair or helping with complex research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Google is raising questions around how OpenAI conducted and announced its gold-medal IMO performance. After all, if you’re going to enter AI models into a math contest for high schoolers, you might as well argue like teenagers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after OpenAI announced its feat on Saturday morning, <a href=\"https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337618787615175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google DeepMind’s CEO </a>and researchers took to social media to <a href=\"https://x.com/lmthang/status/1946960256439058844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">slam OpenAI for announcing its gold medal prematurely </a>— shortly after IMO announced which high schoolers had won the competition on Friday night — and for not having their model’s test officially evaluated by IMO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thang Luong, a Google DeepMind senior researcher and lead for the IMO project, told TechCrunch that Google waited to announce its IMO results to respect the students participating in the competition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luong said that Google has been working with IMO’s organizers since last year in preparation for the test and wanted to have the IMO president’s blessing and official grading before <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcing its official results, which it did on Monday morning</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The IMO organizers have their grading guideline,” Luong said. “So any evaluation that’s not based on that guideline could not make any claim about gold-medal level [performance].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noam Brown, a senior OpenAI researcher who worked on the IMO model, told TechCrunch that IMO reached out to OpenAI a few months ago about participating in a formal math competition, but the ChatGPT-maker declined because it was working on natural language systems that it thought were more worth pursuing. Brown says OpenAI didn’t know IMO was conducting an informal test with Google.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says it hired third-party evaluators — three former IMO medalists who understood the grading system — to grade its AI model’s performance. After OpenAI learned of its gold-medal score, Brown said the company reached out to IMO, which then told the company to wait to announce until after IMO’s Friday night award ceremony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IMO did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google isn’t necessarily wrong here — it did go through a more official, rigorous process to achieve its gold-medal score — but the debate may miss the bigger picture: AI models from several leading AI labs are improving quickly. Countries from around the world sent their brightest students to compete at IMO this year, and just a few percent of them scored as well as OpenAI and Google’s AI models did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI used to have a significant lead over the industry, it certainly feels as though the race is more closely matched than any company would like to admit. OpenAI is expected to release GPT-5 in the coming months, and the company certainly hopes to give off the impression that it still leads the AI industry.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If the agency moves to modify the order or vacate it entirely, it would pave the way for a surveillance vendor with a history of data breaches to legally operate again unimpeded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the ban taking effect in 2021, Zuckerman was caught involved in another spyware operation less than a year later. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/17/support-king-ftc-spytrac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch received a cache of breached data</a> from the servers of a phone spyware app called SpyTrac, which revealed it was being run by a group of freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, likely to skirt the FTC’s ban. The breached data also contained records from SpyFone, despite the FTC’s order requiring the company to delete the data it illegally obtained from victims’ phones, and contained keys that allowed access to cloud storage for OneClickMonitor, another clone spyware app that Support King shut down alongside SpyFone. SpyTrac went offline soon after we contacted Zuckerman for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerman’s petition is already facing criticism from the security community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think this petition should be opposed loudly and vigorously. Mr. Zuckerman has repeatedly shown himself to be a bad actor, flouting the FTC by continuing to run his stalkerware company even after the ban was issued,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no doubt that both the ban and the continued reporting requirements are personally burdensome to him, but I would argue that that is the point,” said Galperin. “I have no doubt that Mr. Zuckerman would start up another stalkerware company the minute he thought he could get away with it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how the FTC will vote on Zuckerman’s petition, nor did the agency set a date. A spokesperson for the FTC did not comment when reached by TechCrunch. The FTC is required by law to seek comments on petitions to undo the agency’s orders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://www.regulations.gov/docket/FTC-2025-0198\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">public can leave feedback</a> on Zuckerman’s petition until August 19.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The FTC is chaired by Trump-appointed Andrew Ferguson, who serves alongside two other Republicans, Mark Meador and Melissa Holyoak. Democratic commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter was reappointed to the FTC last week after the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/politics/710029/slaughter-trump-bedoya-ftc-democrats-removal-unlawful\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">attempted to fire her</a>. The remaining fifth commissioner seat remains vacant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In his petition, Zuckerman appealed to Ferguson directly and the commission’s “current enforcement philosophy,” which Zuckerman told TechCrunch was about “making sure regulations actually provide a positive impact for consumers and the public.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Galperin, meanwhile, said it was important to maintain the reporting requirements on Zuckerman’s future ventures if they are “in any way connected to the internet because he has repeatedly demonstrated that he cannot secure sensitive user data.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

While it’s still too early to draw definitive conclusions, it appears that the hackers who first started abusing this flaw were targeting government organizations, according to Silas Cutler, the principal researcher at Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities on the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It looks like initial exploitation was against a narrow set of targets,” Cutler told TechCrunch. “Likely government related.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a fairly rapidly evolving case. Initial exploitation of this vulnerability was likely fairly limited in terms of targeting, but as more attackers learn to replicate exploitation, we will likely see breaches as a result of this incident,” said Cutler.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these SharePoint attacks?

Eye Security, which first <a href=\"https://research.eye.security/sharepoint-under-siege/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published the existence of the bug</a>, reported seeing a similar number, saying its researchers scanned more than 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and found evidence of dozens of compromised servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the limited number of targets and the types of targets at the beginning of the campaign, Cutler explained, it is likely that the hackers were part of a government group, commonly known as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#advanced-persistent-threat-apt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">advanced persistent threat</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/20/microsoft-sharepoint-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post reported</a> on Sunday that the attacks targeted U.S. federal and state agencies, as well as universities and energy companies, among other commercial targets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a blog post</a> that the vulnerability only affects versions of SharePoint that are installed on local networks, and not the cloud versions, which means that each organization that deploys a SharePoint server needs to apply the patch or disconnect it from the internet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

By “companion,” the study is focused on AI chatbots that are designed for users to have more personal conversations with, not AI assistants that work as homework helpers, image generators, or voice assistants that just answer questions.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, the study’s definition of AI companions could include those digital AI personas provided by companies like Character.AI or Replika, but it could also encompass the use of general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude, which can be used for more personal conversations, if desired. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The study found that chatting with an AI seems to be appealing to U.S. teens (ages 13 to 17), as not only had nearly three-quarters tried an AI companion, but also 52% said they are regular users. Among those who engaged with these companions regularly, 13% chat with them daily and 21% chat a few times a week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boys (31%) were also slightly more likely than girls (25%) to say they had never used an AI companion, among the one in four teens who said they have never tried it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The findings are based on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/talk-trust-and-trade-offs-how-and-why-teens-use-ai-companions\">study</a> that ran during April and May 2025 and used a representative sample of 1,060 teens and was conducted by researchers from NORC at the University of Chicago. There have already been concerns about AI’s impact on teens’ well-being, as one firm, Character.AI, is being sued over <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/technology/characterai-lawsuit-teen-suicide.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a teen’s suicide</a> in Florida and for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd605e48q1vo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">promoting violence</a> in Texas.

The company plans to offer about 12.5 million shares. Yet existing shareholders will be allowed to cash out of nearly 24.7 million shares, <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/ipo-roadshow-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it said.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, should this IPO be as hot as everyone thinks it will be, existing shareholders will get the option to sell, collectively, up to 5.5 million more shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma founder CEO Dylan Field has disclosed that he plans to sell 2.35 million shares. At the midrange he’ll be cashing out of over $62 million. (That might be a much higher number if the IPO prices above $28, too.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with that sale, he will still own an enormous number of shares and control the company. He will hold 74% of the voting rights after the IPO. This is thanks to supervoting rights of 15 votes per share for the Class B stock he controls, plus the right to vote the Class B shares of his co-founder, Evan Wallace, the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025035381/figma-sx1a.htm#i8dccdb6f4d824d4aba81e7c665eaa62d_148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company says in its S-1</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma’s biggest venture investors are all cashing out some shares, as well, including Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. Should the demand be there for the over-allotment, they will cash out 1.7 million to 3.3 million shares apiece.

Previously, iOS users had to completely sign out of a Google account and then log in with another, and repeat this process every time they wanted to access a different account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of us use our mobile devices for both work and personal tasks, often juggling multiple Google Accounts,” <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/chrome-brings-personal-and-work-separation-to-ios-users-and-more-enterprise-protections-to-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google wrote in a blog post.</a> “This can mean constantly signing in and out. Chrome is now offering support for managed account browsing that creates strict data separation from other browsing and seamless switching between accounts.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users sign in or switch to their work Google account in Chrome, browsing related to their organization will be kept separate from their other browsing on the device. Local data and content, including tabs, history, and passwords, stay only within the managed account browsing experience. Google says this is ideal for both end users and IT admins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update comes as Google says many organizations are moving away from company phones, which means employees often have to access company resources from their personal phones and computers. Google says the improved account switching experience and data separation “better enables businesses to allow employees to use their device of choice.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3029522\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1200,632 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1280,675 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=720,379 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=900,474 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=800,422 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=2048,1079 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1171,617 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=708,373 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first time users sign in or switch to a managed account, they will see an onboarding screen that explains the separation of managed account browsing and how their organization is handling their data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Organizations maintain control and can decide how existing browsing data is handled when a user initially signs in or switches to a managed account.

But Uber didn’t have to share what it invested into Nuro, saying only that it was a multi-hundred-million-dollar figure. One source with direct knowledge told me it was more than Lucid’s $300 million. Since the article was published, I’ve had <strong>some little birds</strong> fly in to tell me it was around $400 million. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My whole life has been preparing me for this moment,” Ben Sanders said when asked about why he launched his emergency response startup Hyper. The company announced Monday a $6.3 million seed round led by Eniac Ventures, as well as an official emergence from stealth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a child, he so wanted to become a police officer that he had his mother sew yellow stripes on his navy sweatpants. He wore that with an officer’s rain hat for an entire year. As he grew up, he worked at the intersection of tech and government and once ran for federal office. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around a year ago, he read a news article about how his hometown was looking to use AI to reduce the wait time for emergency services. Sanders, who once launched an AI voice for drive-through restaurants, suddenly had an idea. Though he didn’t think AI was quite ready to help with 911 calls, he felt this was a space for innovation, especially after realizing that most calls made to the emergency line are not considered emergency calls at all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders teamed up with his friend Damian McCabe. The duo officially launched Hyper on Monday, offering an AI voice company that can handle some 911 calls. Sanders, who is CEO, said the product is to deal with the non-emergency calls that take time away from those critical calls that determine the “difference between life and death.” McCabe is the company’s CPO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, even if a person looked to call their local police department, they would most often find a 10-digit number that routes them to the same people who take 911 calls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagine getting stuck talking to someone for eight minutes about a neighbor’s dog barking, only to answer the next call late, because of that noise complaint, and hear the trembling voice of a 5-year-old whose dad has just collapsed on the floor,” Sanders said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyper answers questions, texts links, forwards calls, and even takes non-emergency police reports. “Hyper always plays it safe, so if any calls fall outside the approved scope, or if one sounds slightly more emergency, we can automatically escalate those to a human expert just in case.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders described the fundraising process as “frenetic, manic, and fast.” It took him less than two months to raise the whole round, which was ultimately oversubscribed and included follow-on capital. Ripple Ventures, GreatPoint Ventures, VSC Ventures, Tusk Venture Partners, and K5 Global also participated in the round. Sanders said he met his connection at Eniac Ventures through a mutual acquaintance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyper hopes to use the fresh capital to help scale across the country, integrate more into existing 911 systems, hire a head of engineering, and build its next product. There is some competition in this space, like Aurelian, which also sorts non-emergency calls. Sanders said what makes Hyper different from the rest is its focus on 911. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We train our models on real 911 calls with local agencies,” he said. “We support more languages. And we’ve already gone live with many centers, which is a big operational hurdle in government and public safety.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders hopes that Hyper can take away at least some of the stress associated with being a 911 caller, in a way that perhaps even brings more people to the profession. Right now, he says, most call centers are understaffed and struggling to hire. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s such a tough job, I don’t even know if I could do it,” Sanders said. “But I know how to build technology that can help; to help call-takers and dispatchers who are the unsung heroes; to help reduce their burden by tackling the non-emergency calls and noise, and in doing so, ultimately help save lives.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
