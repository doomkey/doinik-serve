One concern is explainability – understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Seoul-based <a href=\"https://open.datumo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Datumo</a> began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models—without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners and SBI Investment, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defence Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The seven-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: we were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3036051\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg 6600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Selectstar_founders_final2.jpeg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">image credits: datumo (co-founders of datumo)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/13/scale-ai-confirms-significant-investment-from-meta-says-ceo-alexandr-wang-is-leaving/\">Meta’s recent $14.3 billion acquisition-like investment in data-labeling company Scale AI</a> highlights the importance of this market. Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/openai-drops-scale-ai-as-a-data-provider-following-meta-deal/\">OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services</a>. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Datumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/01/mlops-platform-galileo-lands-18m-to-launch-a-free-service/\">Galileo</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/arize-ai-hopes-it-has-first-mover-advantage-in-ai-observability/\">Arize AI</a> in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called <a href=\"https://datumo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Datumo Eval</a>, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will be used to accelerate R&amp;D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Katz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOUao7VDeNo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a video posted to his channel </a>recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after that, he went into woodworking, deciding it was time to chase his dreams and leave behind anything unfulfilling. He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Katz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/creators-raising-venture-capital-unsettling-or-genius/\">made deals with a few creators,</a> independent of this fund.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Slow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/12/creators-raising-venture-capital-unsettling-or-genius/\"> support their careers, as well as their peers</a>.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Parks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple on Tuesday released its sixth developer beta of its mobile operating system, iOS 26, along with updates for iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, and others. As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “<a href=\"https://x.com/BrandonButch/status/1954963282189799636\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">hard</a>,” “<a href=\"https://x.com/bytewith_a/status/1954963742699172327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">crazy good,</a>” and “<a href=\"https://x.com/BetaProfiles/status/1954980183850750377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">such a bop</a>,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, <a href=\"https://bzamayo.com/ios-26-camera-app-swipe-direction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">broke their muscle memory</a>, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Liquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for <a href=\"https://x.com/itsnoahd/status/1954973834777350391\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">readability</a> in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have <a href=\"https://x.com/SSOUIC/status/1954976014284542421\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">added more</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/nikitadrokin/status/1954963133686223088\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">color dispersion</a> as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The <a href=\"https://x.com/theiosguy101/status/1954986497863717355\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lock Screen</a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/AppleKoded/status/1954983241418674638\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">toggles</a> also now offer Liquid Glass effects.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with other beta releases, you can <a href=\"https://x.com/w1zzard_eth/status/1954978244576547252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expect some bug fixes</a>, but you may come across new <a href=\"https://x.com/MioThaG/status/1954961385676279925\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ones</a> as Apple moves forward with the software development process. However, users report that overall, this beta feels more stable <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/pomnych/status/1954960491715187136\">and</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/durreadan01/status/1954966637381366083\">much</a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/actuallyaridan/status/1954970924383686750\">faster</a> than prior releases, suggesting that Apple is nearing its public launch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now that the developer beta has been released, those testing the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/24/apple-ios-26-public-beta-arrives/\">public beta</a> should expect an update soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Understanding this, Ocean made the decision to work with Gmail, not compete against it. As a third-party client, gaining a footing in the market can be difficult, but successful email apps have proven lucrative acquisitions. <a href=\"https://m.techcrunch.com/2013/07/03/source-xobni-was-acquired-for-more-than-60-million/\">Yahoo bought email app Xobni for $60 million</a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2014/12/01/microsoft-buys-email-app-acompli-for-200m-will-still-support-gmail-and-other-competitors/\">Microsoft snapped up Accompli for $200 million</a> in the previous decade, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This market opportunity attracted co-founders <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/martindufort?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAA4ueYBCDnVTzSPgEwMpx2ulR2TJGITBl4&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BI43kjYWrTJ6wJTLDhMy5Vw%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Martin Dufort</a> and <a href=\"https://clay.earth/profile/scott-lake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Scott Lake</a> — an early Shopify co-founder — who created <a href=\"https://bigwavelabs.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BigWave Labs</a> in early 2019 and began to tackle email. This work ultimately resulted in Ocean, an app focused on more efficient email management. (Scott now functions as more of the app’s financial backer and advisor, Dufort says.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app works with Gmail or Google Workspace accounts, allowing users to turn their emails into tasks and action items so they’re not forgotten.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To make this work, the app includes its own Task Manager that has access to the user’s email. That means you don’t have to copy or paste information into an external to-do app while instead gaining access to features that go beyond what Google’s task manager offers Gmail users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ocean, you can create tasks using rich formatting, set due dates, organize tasks into folders, and link emails to your task’s notes. It can also automatically pull out action items from longer emails for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can choose to manage the emails you mean to reply to later by creating a task as well, instead of leaving them unread or applying a label of some sort.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?w=586\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035860\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png 641w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=129,150 129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=258,300 258w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=586,680 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=370,430 370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=620,720 620w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=576,668 576w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=323,375 323w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=532,617 532w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=457,531 457w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ocean-email-triage.png?resize=43,50 43w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>BigWave Labs Inc.</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For inbox zero enthusiasts, the killer feature will be Ocean’s inbox triage tools. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app lets you filter emails by categories like first-timers (people who emailed you for the first time), persistent pingers (people who email you repeatedly), and emails from your contacts. It can even surface emails that are marked as spam but might belong in your inbox, so you don’t miss anything important. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ocean also offers subscription management tools — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/gmails-new-manage-subscriptions-tool-will-help-declutter-your-inbox/\">a feature Gmail recently added</a> — in addition to the baseline email functions of composing, replying, flagging, archiving, and deleting email.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Introducing Ocean for iPhone\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ex7aGg4K-c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, Ocean offers built-in meeting scheduling tools that let you set your availability based on your pending and booked events. Here, you can set your open times and block others from booking those meetings at the last minute, which is a handy trick.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You can also send an automated email invite to meeting recipients, confirm meeting proposals from a web interface, and automatically add confirmed meetings to your calendar. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ocean-focused-inbox/id6743085502\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> Ocean iPhone app</a> has just launched, but a new Mac app is in the works, which will include iCloud sync. The team expects to launch this by year-end. The company aims to generate revenue via its non-recurring membership model, Ocean Blue, which costs $67. The membership includes a year’s worth of updates with new features and functions. It will also offer access to the Mac app, when it arrives.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think people are kind of getting tired of recurring subscriptions,” explains Dufort. “We wanted to move away from this, but still provide a model that would be sustainable for us. So we decided to define this Ocean Blue membership. The app is basically a freemium model — you get the base functions for free forever,” he continues. “[The membership] puts pressure on us also to make sure we deliver value to this app as we’re moving forward,” he adds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Blue membership will also include AI email summarization features and email insights. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interested users can first put Ocean to the test with a 14-day free trial that doesn’t automatically convert you into a paying subscriber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/24/judge-trump-ev-chargers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">ruled in June</a> that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Duffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing</a></em> a<em>nd get the chance to win a prize in return!</em></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The event is reported to be on September 9, and Apple is expected to release its iPhone 17 lineup, along with updates for the Apple Watch and AirPods. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As always, there are many rumors circulating, including bigger screens and improved cameras for the iPhone 17 models and the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone Air that could replace the Plus model.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-iphone-17-17-pro-and-17-pro-max\">iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 is expected to get a significant makeover to align more closely with the Pro models. It could feature a slightly larger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/27/iphone-17-base-model-larger-display-rumor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">6.3-inch screen</a>, which is an increase of 0.2 inches compared to the iPhone 16, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/iphone-17-upgraded-120hz-panel-no-promotion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">120Hz display</a>, a substantial upgrade from the current 60Hz. It’s also rumored to have a 24-megapixel front camera. It could also come in new colors: purple and green.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Pro’s upgrades will be noticeable on the back of the phone, rumors suggest. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ankv6yBKNCM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Conceptual renderings</a> show that the three rear cameras may be arranged in a rectangular bar that extends from one edge of the device to the other. The flash, light sensor, and microphone would be positioned far to the right side. Where the MagSafe charger is, the Apple logo is said to be centered for aesthetic reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the iPhone 17 Pro may switch materials, potentially replacing the titanium band around the screen with aluminum. This could help Apple reduce costs as well as provide a lighter feel.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to see fewer upgrades, too, with the most significant change being a slightly thicker body, likely to accommodate a larger battery — which would be a huge win. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/PExRlau6t?pagetype=profilefeed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">leaker Instant Digital</a>, the iPhone 17 is predicted to be priced around $800, and the Pro model could cost around $1,050. The Pro Max is expected to have a price tag of $1,250.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-iphone-air\">iPhone Air</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035098\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=300,157 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=768,403 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=680,356 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=430,225 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=720,377 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=900,472 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=800,419 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=668,350 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=1177,617 1177w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=708,371 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/iPhoneAir-render.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple Track</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The most widely discussed rumor is that Apple might be introducing its slimmest phone ever, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/apple-may-add-an-iphone-air-to-its-lineup/\">the iPhone Air</a>, which may replace the iPhone Plus. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This rumored device is said to have a profile thickness of 5.5 mm, making it about 0.08 inches thinner than current iPhones. It’ll also feature a 6.6-inch screen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This move appears to be Apple’s response to the trend of slimmer smartphones, following in the footsteps of other companies like Samsung and Huawei. The iPhone Air could potentially outshine the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, which measures 5.8 mm thick. Additionally, it may pave the way for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/15/apple-reportedly-developing-foldable-iphone-and-ipad/\">Apple’s long-rumored foldable phone</a>, predicted to launch in September 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the thin design is stylish, it would come with some compromises. Based on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2845273/take-a-look-at-the-iphone-17-air-in-all-4-rumored-colors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">renders</a> we’ve seen, the Air is expected to have only one rear camera lens, unlike the Plus, which has two. There are also <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/25/iphoen-17-air-design-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rumors</a> that there may not be enough space for a speaker at the bottom, meaning the only audio source could be the front earpiece at the top.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reports suggest the device will be priced at $950 and will be available in black, silver, and light gold.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-apple-watch-series-11-ultra-3-and-se-3\">Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, and SE 3</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2851038\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/apple-watch-series-10-v2.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After a two-year wait, there are various rumors surrounding the Apple Watch Ultra 3, suggesting it will undergo significant changes. These may include faster charging speeds, 5G support, and satellite connectivity. Additionally, it’s speculated that the watch will feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/08/05/apple-watch-ultra-3-display-size/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">larger display</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the most exciting potential upgrades for both the Ultra 3 and Series 11 is the incorporation of blood pressure monitoring capabilities. This feature would notify users if their blood pressure levels are too high or too low. Apple is also considering adding a sleep apnea feature. However, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the company <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-07/apple-watch-series-10-ultra-3-details-bigger-screens-blood-pressure-challenge-lybjqp0q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">may need to delay the release of these features for further tweaks</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The third generation of Apple Watch SE isn’t expected to receive major updates, aside from possibly a larger display. There continue to be reports of a plastic version being introduced, according to Gurman. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rumored prices for the watches are: $250 for the Apple Watch SE 3, $400 for the Series 11, and $800 for the Ultra 3.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-airpods-pro-3\">AirPods Pro 3</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035153\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg 750w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=150,111 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=300,222 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=680,504 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=430,319 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=720,534 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=668,495 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=506,375 506w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=708,525 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airpods-pro-2-hero-.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the release of the AirPods Pro 2 in 2022, it’s about time for an upgrade, and Apple might just be ready to deliver. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/10/ios-26-code-airpods-pro-3/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rumors</a> suggest that the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a sleeker design, touch-sensitive controls, smaller earbuds, and a slimmer case.

Although these documents are loaded with legalese, it’s clear that both economic developments are on the minds of their respective executive teams. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian and Lucid both make specific and multiple mentions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the risk factors section of their 10Qs. The OBBBA eliminates certain tax credits for EV buyers and essentially devalues the zero-emissions regulatory credit market. Tariffs and trade policy risks also make cameos. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1811210/000181121025000007/lcid-20250630.htm\">notes in its 10Q</a> that it is assessing the impact of OBBBA. “If any of the Company’s suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners experience financial distress, insolvency or disruptions in operations, they may be unable to fulfill their obligations or meet the Company’s production and quality requirements.”  Meanwhile, Rivian tries to strike a “glass half full” tone by noting that 45X tax credit for domestic battery production remains. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford and GM also make mention of the OBBBA, although both spend more time talking about the potential effects of tariffs. GM says it’s unable to estimate the financial impacts of the OBBBA, but notes it “could be material and may adversely affect electric vehicle profitability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the unfortunate upshot (and potential third punch): A new <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/trump-says-hell-announce-semiconductor-and-chip-tariffs/\">100% import tariff</a> on semiconductor chips could squeeze automakers even more. Anyone who paid attention during the COVID pandemic remembers how <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/23/business/auto-semiconductors-general-motors-mercedes.html\">supply constraints on chips</a> hurt automakers. Industry experts estimate that a modern vehicle contains more than 1,000 — and in some cases more than 3,000 — chips. None of these companies want to go through this again. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The question is how they will qualify for exemptions; the Trump administration said it will award them to companies that manufacture the chips domestically. Automakers don’t typically make chips, which means these companies may all turn to domestic suppliers. This is, of course, a TBD scenario since the administration has a history of changing policy, and it has yet to provide details on this 100% tariff and exactly how to secure an exemption. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is uncertainty, the wet blanket of any enterprise.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-little-bird\">A little bird</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/blinky-cat-bird-green.gif?w=680\" alt=\"blinky cat bird green\" class=\"wp-image-1896211\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Bryce Durbin</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You would think that a trade war with China and concerns about protecting American technology would discourage Chinese companies from setting up shop in the U.S. But lately, I have heard some chatter from a few birds in the industry that Chinese companies, specifically those working on autonomous vehicle technology or adjacent tech, are repatriating to the United States.

The urban air-mobility business, which went public via a merger with a blank-check company, enjoyed its fair share of buzz <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blade-helicopter-had-fake-spokesperson-2021-6\">and controversy</a> since its founding in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And now it’s owned by electric air-taxi developer <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>. The <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/joby-aviation-to-buy-blade-air-mobilitys-ride-share-business/\">deal is worth up to $125 million</a> and includes the Blade brand and its passenger business, which has operations in the United States and Europe.

Blade has sought partnerships with other electric aircraft companies, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/05/wisk-aero-and-blade-urban-air-mobility-partner-to-bring-electric-air-taxi-services-to-the-skies/\">including Wisk</a>.

It also puts an end to a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <strong>Tesla</strong> news cycle just won’t quit. And for some, it may feel contradictory. The company’s board of directors approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/04/tesla-hands-29b-comp-package-to-elon-musk-amid-ai-talent-war/\">around $29 billion in shares</a>, with the company citing the “ever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla’s position at a critical inflection point” as reasons for the payout. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has seen automotive revenues drop, is pushing to turn its AI and autonomy ambitions into moneymakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two developments this week have chipped away at those aspirations. First, Tesla has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/07/tesla-shuts-down-dojo-the-ai-training-supercomputer-that-musk-said-would-be-key-to-full-self-driving/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shuttered its Dojo supercomputer program</a>, ending its bid to develop in-house chips for driverless technology. And separately, a jury found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash and ordered it to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/01/tesla-partly-liable-in-florida-autopilot-trial-jury-awards-200m-in-damages/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pay around $242.5 million</a> in punitive and compensatory damages. It’s a notable case in which plaintiffs successfully argued there is a gap between how Tesla talks about its Autopilot driver-assistance system and its actual capabilities.

In response, a member of Electronic Arts’ anti-cheat team, which goes by AC, <a href=\"https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/update-battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote in an official forum</a> that the company saw players report 104,000 “instances of potential cheaters” over the first two days of the game’s being online, and that it stopped 330,000 “attempts to cheat or tamper with anti-cheat controls.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like many video games today, such as Valorant, Electronic Arts uses a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#kernel\">kernel-level</a> anti-cheat system called Javelin, which means the system has the highest possible privileges on the computer. This allows it to monitor everything that happens on the machine with the goal of catching cheats, which are often running in the background and disguised as some other program. </p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you develop cheats, hack video games, or work in anti-cheat?

AC also referred to the fact that the game enforces Secure Boot, a Windows hardware-based security feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On Secure Boot, I want to be clear that Secure Boot is not, and was not intended to be a silver bullet,” AC wrote. “Secure Boot is how you’re helping us build up our arsenal. It’s another barrier that helps us make it harder for cheat developers to create cheat programs, and makes it easier for us to detect it when they do.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done, it’s an ever evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them,” AC added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Electronic Arts spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company has no updated information on the numbers of players who were banned. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cheaters or game hackers are a problem for every online video game.

Those include banning cheaters, taking advantage of Windows’ own security features to limit where cheats can run, fingerprinting cheaters’ hardware so they can’t just create a new fresh account to cheat with, and even infiltrating cheat communities on Discord or Telegram.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Moving forward, Revel will instead focus on its nascent EV charging business, which includes operating five stations in New York and one in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A visit to Revel’s app on Monday showed a message thanking users for “riding with us the last 4 years!” and announcing it has “permanently closed our rideshare service.” Revel’s website echoed the same message, adding: “Moving forward, Revel will continue to grow our Fast Charging business with more sites and cities opening soon.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have made the difficult decision that the best way we can keep the EV transition moving forward is by ending our rideshare service and focusing on building the fast charging infrastructure our biggest cities need to keep going electric,” Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig said in a statement to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revel will sell or return the bright-blue Tesla and Kia vehicles that make up its fleet, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-11/revel-to-end-new-york-rideshare-business-to-focus-on-ev-charging\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to Bloomberg News</a>. The company will also sell the 165 “for-hire vehicle license plates” attached to those vehicles, which Reig told Bloomberg could be worth between $20,000 and $25,000 each.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Revel revealed its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/29/revel-unveils-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-superhub-with-25-chargers-in-brooklyn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">first chargers in 2021</a>, around the same time <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/28/revel-launches-an-all-electric-rideshare-service-with-a-fleet-of-50-teslas/\">it launched the ride-hail fleet</a>. But the company experienced slow adoption in those early years for its charging business. The company told TechCrunch that total utilization of the network in early 2023 was just 21%, with 19% of that coming from Revel’s own ride-hail fleet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fast-forward to early 2025, and that utilization rate had jumped to 45%, with only 12% of that charging coming from Revel’s fleet. The company got a big boost in 2024 when Uber struck a deal to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-06/uber-partners-with-ev-startup-revel-to-expand-charging-network\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">send many of its drivers to Revel’s chargers</a>. Revel says it plans to have “over 400” charging stalls operational in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco by the end of 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing.</a></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1953660184351707210\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">posted</a> late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity &amp; cost by a few orders of magnitude.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk has talked about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/06/tesla-dojo-elon-musks-big-plan-to-build-an-ai-supercomputer-explained/\">Dojo</a> since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/teslas-dojo-a-timeline/\">2019</a>, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla’s mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/26/tesla-dojo-supercomputer-buffalo-factory-500-million/\">Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million</a> to build in Buffalo, New York. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk’s forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events. </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to give us your thoughts</a></em><em>, and get the chance to win a prize in return.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/articles/history/moving-assembly-line.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">112 years ago</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And it’s a bet that began several years ago with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/ex-tesla-exec-leading-ford-skunkworks-project-to-develop-low-cost-ev/\">skunkworks team</a> of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/12/fords-secretive-low-cost-ev-team-is-growing-with-talent-from-rivian-tesla-and-apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">with talent</a> from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/FordUniversalEVProductionSystem_animation_16x9-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035701\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ford</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Clarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its <a href=\"https://corporate.ford.com/operations/locations/global-plants/louisville-assembly-plant.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Louisville assembly plant</a>, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing.</a></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Then in July, the company said it would <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/14/nvidia-is-set-to-resume-china-chip-sales-after-months-of-regulatory-whiplash/\">resume</a> sales of its H20 AI chips to China, which it had designed specifically for sale in the country following restrictions by the Biden administration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” an Nvidia spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “While we haven’t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Nvidia’s change of course was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/16/nvidias-resumption-of-h20-chip-sales-related-to-rare-earth-element-trade-talks/\">related</a> to trade discussions with China regarding rare-earth elements, which are necessary for making components, like rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The administration’s decision to approve the sale of Nvidia’s H20 chips has its critics: National security experts and former government officials <a href=\"https://ari.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Letter-to-Secretary-Lutnick-on-H20-restrictions.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> to Lutnick last month, urging the government to reverse course.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Note: This story was updated to add a statement by Nvidia.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events. </em><em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to give us your thoughts</a></em><em>, and get the chance to win a prize in return.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The investors are betting on the team’s ability to pair local market expertise with execution and turn a notoriously difficult sector into a profitable super app for food, groceries and essentials.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re thrilled about this round as it brings us closer to our vision of becoming Africa’s number one super app,” CEO and co-founder <a href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/femialuko\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Femi Aluko</a> said. “This funding will supercharge our growth plans, enabling us to expand into more cities, reduce delivery times, scale our grocery footprint, and attract the best talent to drive innovation and customer satisfaction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in October 2021 by Aluko, <a href=\"https://ng.linkedin.com/in/olumide-ojo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Olumide Ojo</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/chowdeck-hopes-to-scale-notoriously-tough-food-delivery-market/\">Lanre Yusuf</a>, Chowdeck now operates in 11 cities across Nigeria and Ghana, serving 1.5 million customers with a network of more than 20,000 riders. Its logistics system averages 30 minutes per order, and in dense areas, more than half of deliveries arrive by bicycle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While prominent players have exited or scaled back their African operations, Chowdeck has leaned into the complexity of local markets — delivering local meals, an operationally harder challenge — to build trust with customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2024, the value of meals delivered through Chowdeck grew more than sixfold from the previous year. This year, the company says it passed its 2024 total before July.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new funding will help Chowdeck roll out quick commerce, ultra-fast delivery backed by a network of dark stores and hyperlocal logistics hubs. The company plans to open 40 dark stores by the end of this year and 500 by the end of 2026, with two to three new stores launching each week. Chowdeck <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/chowdeck-hopes-to-scale-notoriously-tough-food-delivery-market/\">raised a $2.5 million</a> seed round last year. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3035687\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg 3600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=150,80 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=300,160 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=768,409 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=680,362 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1200,638 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1280,681 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=430,229 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=720,383 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=900,479 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=800,426 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1536,817 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=2048,1089 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=668,355 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=1160,617 1160w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=708,377 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Chowdeck-team.jpeg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Chowdeck</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Food delivery is a crowded business globally, but when done well, it has led to some other big companies, like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/06/doordash-to-buy-uks-deliveroo-for-3-86b/\">DoorDash</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quick commerce, on the other hand, has been a capital-intensive gamble in most markets. In Europe, <a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/getir-acquisition-gorillas-is-death-knell-for-quick-commerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Gorillas and Getir </a>burned through hundreds of millions of dollars before retreating or consolidating. In India, platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/blinkit-signals-costly-battle-ahead-in-indian-quick-commerce-market/\">Blinkit</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/zepto-shifts-domicile-to-india-as-local-listings-gain-appeal/\">Zepto</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/swiggy-escalates-india-quick-commerce-battle-with-10-minute-meals/\">Swiggy</a> have had varying levels of success with the model when it comes to profitability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdeck has been profitable since before this raise and Aluko says the company doesn’t enter cities or verticals without planning to break even within a couple of weeks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, the food delivery platform <a href=\"https://techpoint.africa/news/chowdeck-launches-in-ghana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">entered neighboring Ghana this May</a>. Within three months, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2025/07/31/chowdeck-hits-1000-daily-orders-ghana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it was handling 1,000 daily orders</a> without paid advertising, which, according to Aluko, came from pent-up demand for a service that delivers local favorites alongside international cuisine. The company aims to quintuple that volume to 5,000 daily orders by the end of September 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aluko says Chowdeck plans to apply the same playbook to dark stores, which will complement its restaurant and grocery delivery operations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another vertical complementing these operations will be software. This June, <a href=\"https://chowdeck.com/blog/beyond-delivery-why-we-acquired-mira\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the YC-backed startup acquired Mira</a>, a point-of-sale provider for African food and hospitality businesses. Mira’s tools manage inventory and orders in real time; now, it will help Chowdeck optimize its operations, positioning the company as a vertical SaaS-plus-logistics provider for restaurants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Chowdeck’s raise is a win for local players in the sector, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/18/jumia-quit-food-delivery-because-of-deep-pocketed-aggressive-rivals-ceo-says/\">after Jumia’s exit</a> left market share to foreign brands such as Glovo, Bolt Food, and Yango. Yet, <a href=\"https://techcabal.com/2023/11/09/bolt-food-pulls-the-plug-on-nigeria-operations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">some of these companies</a> have also withdrawn <a href=\"https://techpoint.africa/news/glovo-to-shut-down-in-ghana/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">from certain markets</a>, including Nigeria and Ghana, which Chowdeck is now targeting aggressively.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Super apps such as Gozem, YC-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/yassir-pulls-in-150m-for-its-super-app-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/\">Yassir</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/26/egypts-mnt-halan-banks-157-5m-gobbles-up-a-fintech-in-turkey-to-expand/\">MNT-Halan</a> are other local companies offering food delivery services in other African markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The market is still very early,” Aluko said. “Customer behavior is shifting online for the first time. A whole generation is growing up ordering food without ever having walked into some of the restaurants or markets on our platform.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For lead investor Novastar Ventures, the bet is on execution and local insight. “Chowdeck is building the future of logistics for African cities,” said partner Brian Waswani Odhiambo. “With deep local insight, a sustainability-first approach, and impressive execution, it is redefining last-mile delivery on the continent.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-techcrunch wp-block-embed-techcrunch\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>We’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us! <a href=\"https://survey.researchresults.com/survey/selfserve/53b/g002/s0064551?list=tcap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Fill out this survey to let us know how we’re doing.</a></em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
