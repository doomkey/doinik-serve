The CPSC has linked the batteries to 31 reports of fire so far. Twelve of those incidents resulted in property damage, and some of them even occurred when the batteries were not charging, according to the commission.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The hazardous batteries can unexpectedly ignite and explode, posing a fire hazard to consumers, especially when the battery or the harness has been exposed to water and debris,” the CPSC writes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The battery fires and the CPSC warning are coming at a particularly bad time for Rad Power, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/10/rad-power-bikes-faces-shutdown-in-january-without-new-funding/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told employees earlier this month</a> the company will shut down for good in January if it cannot find new funding.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CPSC said Monday that Rad Power “refused to agree to an acceptable recall,” and claims the company said it is “unable to offer replacement batteries or refunds to all consumers” due to its financial situation. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power told TechCrunch it “firmly stands behind our batteries and our reputation as leaders in the ebike industry, and strongly disagrees with the CPSC’s characterization of certain Rad batteries as defective or unsafe.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it “offered multiple good-faith solutions to address the agency’s concerns,” including upgrading customers to its latest batteries, which are not subject to the official warning. “CPSC rejected this opportunity. The significant cost of the all-or-nothing demand would force Rad to shut its doors immediately, leaving no way to support our riders or our employees.” (The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/828004/rad-power-bikes-batteries-fire-cpsc?utm_content=buffercb185&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first reported</a> Rad Power’s disagreement with the CPSC.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rad Power claimed its batteries comply with “the highest industry standards” and said the “incident rate associated with the batteries in the CPSC’s notice is a fraction of one percent.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While that number is low, we know even one incident is one too many, and we are heartbroken by any report involving our products,” the company told TechCrunch in an email. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Owners can find out if they have batteries covered by the warning on the CPSC warning <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Warnings/2026/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-to-Immediately-Stop-Using-Batteries-for-E-Bikes-from-Rad-Power-Bikes-Due-to-Fire-Hazard-Risk-of-Serious-Injury-or-Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">page</a>. The commission is telling customers not to throw the lithium-ion batteries away, or bring them to traditional recyclers. Instead, they should bring the batteries to “municipal household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center[s].”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The organization handles the licensing and registration of vehicles in the Netherlands and is seen as a critical step for Tesla to get approval for — and eventually roll out — FSD to consumers across Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“RDW has committed to granting Netherlands National approval in February 2026. Please contact them via link below to express your excitement &amp; thank them for making this happen as soon as possible,” Tesla wrote in the post.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It seems RDW isn’t quite in line with Tesla. The Dutch regulator clarified in a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.rdw.nl/nieuws/2025/reactie-rdw-naar-aanleiding-van-oproep-tesla\">statement on their website</a> that Tesla plans to demonstrate FSD Supervised in February.

Whether the schedule will be met remains to be seen in the coming period. For the RDW, (traffic) safety is paramount,” the statement reads.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tesla vehicles come standard with a driver assistance system called Autopilot. For an additional $8,000 fee, owners can upgrade to FSD Supervised, which provides additional automated driving features, including steering and lane changes on highways and surface streets. FSD is not self-driving and requires the driver to remain engaged with their hands on the wheel at all times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FSD is available in Australia, Canada, China, Mexico, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, and the United States.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The device takes whatever creative idea you have in your head and transforms it into a printed sticker that you can then color, peel, and stick anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before trying the device itself, I have to admit I came with a preconceived negative bias — as did my fellow tester (my daughter). Our initial reactions were similiar: “<em>An AI that prints stickers? I’d rather design and print my own</em>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying the review unit sent by the company, we were won over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://stickerbox.com/\">Stickerbox</a>, I realized, could represent a new form of creative play — and one that doesn’t outsource the child’s imagination to an AI model as much as you’d think. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?w=510\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070381\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg 3502w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=112,150 112w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=225,300 225w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=768,1024 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=510,680 510w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=900,1200 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=960,1280 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=322,430 322w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=540,720 540w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=675,900 675w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=600,800 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1152,1536 1152w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=1536,2048 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=501,668 501w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=281,375 281w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=463,617 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=398,531 398w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0092.jpg?resize=37,50 37w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-testing-the-ai-sticker-printer\">Testing the AI sticker printer</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The $99.99 toy itself is a small, bright red box with a black-and-white screen and a big, white “push-to-talk” button on top. It ships with three rolls of paper, which equates to 180 stickers, as well as a power cord and colored pencils.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The box’s color scheme is reminiscent of the Etch A Sketch, which makes sense, given that the Stickerbox feels like a modern spin on that concept. In the Etch A Sketch’s case, you have to learn how to control different knobs to create the image in your mind. With Stickerbox, those “knobs” are replaced with something more abstract: the voice commands you use to prompt the AI model. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kids aren’t thinking about how to be better prompt engineers, of course; they’re just exploring their imagination and having fun seeing their ideas come to life. Any improvement in their prompting abilities is a side effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To initially set up the device, a parent will need to help. Much like adding a smart speaker to your home’s Wi-Fi, you have to first connect to the Stickerbox’s Wi-Fi, then enter the information to connect with your home network. The setup process, which only took a minute, went off without a hitch.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070370\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg 4159w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=1536,1536 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=2048,2048 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stickerbox-with-Hand.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Stickerbox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Using Stickerbox is simple. You push the button, describe an image out loud, then release the button to see your text appear on screen, followed by an AI-generated image as the printer spits out a physical copy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a serendipity to an experience in which you’re thinking of an idea and then holding it in your hand in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device’s thermal image printer requires no ink, and the paper is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ecocenter.org/about-bpa-and-bps-receipt-paper\">BPS and BPA</a>-free, making it safe to use. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The printed sticker is easy to tear off and then can be colored in with the colored pencils that come with the device. Your own crayons and markers also work. This combines the somewhat dopamine-driven experience of thinking up new things to print with the more calming or meditative aspects that come with coloring, similar to giving kids a coloring book.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ended up offering a healthy balance between using potentially addictive tech and then slowing down to engage in a real-world activity. It also helped to address potential boredom. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?w=676\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070382\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg 4280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=298,300 298w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=768,772 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=676,680 676w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1193,1200 1193w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1273,1280 1273w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=428,430 428w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=716,720 716w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=895,900 895w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=796,800 796w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=1527,1536 1527w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=2037,2048 2037w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=664,668 664w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=373,375 373w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=614,617 614w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=528,531 528w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0097.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 676px) 100vw, 676px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more you use the Sitckerbox, the more you realize how complex your prompts can be. You don’t just have to ask for a basic image, like a “magical unicorn,” you can speak to the Stickerbox with long, train-of-thought commands, and the AI parses what you mean.

While that experience taught him a lot about what makes a great consumer-facing product, his later stint at Anthropic gave him a first-hand look at the advances in AI technology.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, it was his experience as a father that inspired Stickerbox. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When his son asked for a coloring page he didn’t have on hand, he turned to ChatGPT to make a printable image. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I made it for him —  a tiger eating ice cream. And he had never seen a printer before. I got out from under the bed, our HP brother printer — literally dusted it off and printed it for him, and he ran off happily and started coloring it,” explained Whitney. “But, a minute later, the gears were turning, and he came back to me, and he was like, ‘I want a lizard riding a skateboard.’ And I was like, okay, cool, let me make that for you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">His son was so thrilled with the process of being able to say something and see it come to life that he realized there could be something to this. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just saw this look on his face of magic — like pure magic,” noted Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-founders were also thinking about how AI technology offered so many novel experiences, but most weren’t made for kids. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nobody’s building AI specifically for kids. So that’s what we’re looking for,” said Gupta. “What are the right guardrails? What are the right ways? What are the right products?” </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?w=453\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070376\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png 832w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=100,150 100w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=200,300 200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=768,1152 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=453,680 453w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=800,1200 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=287,430 287w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=480,720 480w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=600,900 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=533,800 533w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=445,668 445w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=250,375 250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=411,617 411w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=354,531 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stacked-Boxes.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 453px) 100vw, 453px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They realized that kids have great imaginations, ideal for working with an AI image model. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[They have] endless imagination and creativity … they’re learning new things every day. Every week, they’ve got a new obsession. We’re literally the first people in the world, I think, to put an image model inside of a box,” Gupta said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-built-for-updates\">Built for Updates </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Under the hood, Stickerbox actually uses a combination of AI models, including its own proprietary tech focused on making the device kid-safe. It won’t respond to requests for harmful content, like violence or sexual imagery, and it filters out swear words. And if you try a somewhat more innocuous command, like “boobs,” it just prints a random sticker that may be vaguely related to the word. (For instance, you might get a generic cartoon girl, but not a large-chested one.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After trying and failing to get a naughty result, most kids will likely go back to just prompting the device for silly images instead. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We want to be the trusted brand for parents where you don’t have to look over your kid’s shoulder and be like, ‘what are they doing? How are they using this?,” said Gupta. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, the company generates some revenue from the device sales, but it keeps the cost of restocking paper low. It’s just $5.99 for three rolls, which equates to 180 stickers. (It’s currently running a promotion that offers six rolls with every purchase now.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over time, the team plans to explore adding premium features, including a way to upload your own image to imagine yourself in fantastic scenarios or collaboration tools.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Meet Stickerbox: Creativity That Sticks\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxN-MqM_RKI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a Wi-Fi-connected device, the Stickerbox is regularly updated with new firmware and features. In tests, for instance, we were able to print some recognizable characters, but a more recent update added new guardrails to guide kids toward more original designs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A soon-to-launch companion app also lets you view past creations and save favorites, and could ultimately serve as the home for premium features.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stickerbox is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://twitter.com/jerrylu/status/1990808053818470704\">backed by $7 million</a> in funding from <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.maveron.com/\">Maveron</a>, Serena Williams’ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.serenaventures.com/\">Serena Ventures</a>, the Allen Institute’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.ai2incubator.com/\">AI2 incubator</a>, and various angels, including Matt Brezina, and product leaders from other consumer apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The buildout is meant to expand federal government agencies’ access to AWS AI services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The project will add 1.3 gigawatts of compute and will expand government access to AWS products, including Amazon SageMaker AI, model customization, Amazon Bedrock, model deployment, and Anthropic’s Claude chatbot, among others, according to the company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS expects to break ground on these data center projects in 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” AWS CEO Matt Garman said in the company’s press release. “We’re giving agencies expanded access to advanced AI capabilities that will enable them to accelerate critical missions from cybersecurity to drug discovery. This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AWS is no stranger to working with the U.S. government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entity began building cloud infrastructure for the U.S. government back in 2011.

It’s the last of Anthropic’s 4.5 series of models to be released, following the launch of Sonnet 4.5 in September and Haiku 4.5 in October.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new version of Opus has state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks, including coding benchmarks (SWE-Bench and Terminal-bench), tool use (tau2-bench and MCP Atlas) and general problem solving (ARC-AGI 2, GPQA Diamond). </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Opus 4.5 is the first model to score over 80 percent on SWE-Bench verified, a respected coding benchmark.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic also emphasized the Opus’s computer use and spreadsheet capabilities, and launched a number of parallel products to showcase how the model holds up in those settings. Together with Opus 4.5, Anthropic will make its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.claude.com/blog/claude-for-chrome\">Claude for Chrome</a> and <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel\">Claude for Excel</a> products — previously in pilot — more broadly available. The Chrome extension will be available to all Max users, while the Excel-focused model will be available to Max, Team and Enterprise users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 also comes with memory improvements for long-context operations, which required significant changes in how the model manages its memory. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There are improvements we made on general long context quality in training with Opus 4.5, but context windows are not going to be sufficient by themselves,” Dianne Na Penn, Anthropic’s head of product management for research, told TechCrunch. “Knowing the right details to remember is really important in complement to just having a longer context window.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those changes also enabled a long-requested “endless chat” feature for paid Claude users, which will allow chats to proceed without interruption when the model hits its context window. Instead, the model will compress its context memory without alerting the user.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Many of the upgrades are made with an eye towards agentic use-cases, particularly scenarios in which Opus acts as a lead agent commanding a group of Haiku-powered sub-agents. Managing those tasks requires a strong command of working memory, which is where the memory improvements described by Penn really show their worth.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is where fundamentals like memory become really important,” Penn says, “because Claude needs to be able to explore code bases and large documents, and also know when to backtrack and recheck something.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Opus 4.5 will face stiff competition from other recently released frontier models, most notably OpenAI’s GPT 5.1 (released on November 12) and Google’s Gemini 3 (released November 18).</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

So far, the startup says it has orders for 144 SMRs capable of generating 11 gigawatts of electricity. Customers include Amazon, Dow, and British energy company Centrica.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new round was led by Jane Street, which joined as an investor in the expanded Series C. Other investors participating include Ares Management funds, ARK Invest, Corner Capital, Emerson Collective, Galvanize, Hood River Capital Management, NGP, Point72, Reaves Asset Management, Segra Capital Management, and XTX Ventures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">X-energy is developing high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors, a type more recently used in Japan and China. Each of its Xe-100 reactors can generate 80 megawatts of electricity, and they are fueled by billiard ball-sized, carbon-coated pebbles containing uranium particles. Inside the reactor, helium gas flows over the pebbles, collecting heat, which is transferred to a steam turbine to generate electricity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like other nuclear startups, X-energy has ridden a wave of interest from tech companies and data center developers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/16/amazon-jumps-on-nuclear-power-bandwagon-by-investing-in-x-energy-and-promising-small-reactors/\">led the first installment</a> of the startup’s Series C.

DOGE was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/20/president-trump-signs-exec-order-to-make-musks-doge-commission-more-official/\">created by an executive order</a> signed by President Trump in January. The initiative was expected to run for close to two years.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As of early November, DOGE “doesn’t exist,” according to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which serves as the federal government’s human resources department.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a tweet on Sunday, Kupor <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/skupor/status/1992676347194523912\">said</a> that DOGE “may not have centralized leadership” anymore under the U.S. Digital Service, but “the principles of DOGE remain alive and well: de-regulation; eliminating fraud, waste and abuse; re-shaping the federal workforce; making efficiency a first-class citizen.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amy Gleason, who was named as the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/25/doge-has-an-official-acting-administrator-and-its-not-elon-musk-white-house-confirms/\">“official” acting administrator</a> of DOGE earlier this year, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gleasonamy_sharing-to-my-network-since-i-have-had-several-activity-7398745869577035776-Awij\">posted on LinkedIn</a> soon after Kupor’s remarks, featuring a Doge meme with the words, “I’m alive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While active, DOGE claimed to have saved the federal government billions of dollars in wasted taxpayer dollars. But critics, including lawmakers, say DOGE dismantled federal programs and government departments with little to show in terms of quantifiable savings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">DOGE’s cuts have <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/07/01/nx-s1-5452513/trump-usaid-foreign-aid-deaths\">also been blamed</a> for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-documentary/the-shutdown-of-usaid-has-already-killed-hundreds-of-thousands\">countless deaths</a> across the world following the shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which provided humanitarian aid and disaster relief. DOGE also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/doge-biggest-breach-of-united-states-government-data-under-way/\">accessed federal databases containing highly sensitive personal information</a> belonging to millions of Americans, and was accused of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/doge-uploaded-live-copy-of-social-security-database-to-vulnerable-cloud-server-says-whistleblower/\">security lapses</a> that put that data at risk from malicious adversaries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Musk departed DOGE earlier this year <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/elon-musk-and-donald-trump-are-smack-talking-each-other-into-their-own-digital-echo-chambers/\">after a public falling out</a> with President Trump.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/21/doge-elon-musk-succession-00641110\">According to Politico</a>, several DOGE staffers are said to be fearful that they could face future federal charges without protections from Musk, who might have been able to secure presidential pardons for them if necessary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Several DOGE staffers are now working for other U.S. federal government departments, according to Reuters, while other prominent DOGE staffers have said they no longer work for the government. Edward Coristine, whose nickname “Big Balls” went viral, said in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/EdwardCoristine/status/1937632556226347249\">a post on X</a> in June that he is “officially out” of DOGE.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And addiction is amazing business. It’s a very effective way to keep your users, but it’s not great for our community and having any embodied sense of ourselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Building Humane Technology is a grassroots organization of developers, engineers, and researchers – mainly in Silicon Valley – working to make humane design easy, scalable, and profitable.<em> </em>The group hosts hackathons where tech workers build solutions for humane tech challenges, and is developing a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://certifiedhumane.ai/\">certification standard</a> that evaluates whether AI systems uphold humane technology principles. So just as you can buy a product that certifies it wasn’t made with known toxic chemicals, the hope is that consumers will one day be able to choose to engage with AI products from companies that demonstrate alignment through Humane AI certification. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070309\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg 2364w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1200,774 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1280,825 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=800,516 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=1536,990 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=2048,1320 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=668,431 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=582,375 582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=957,617 957w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/humanebench-bad-persona.jpg?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">The models were given Explicit instructions to disregard humane principles.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Most AI benchmarks measure intelligence and instruction-following, rather than psychological safety. HumaneBench joins exceptions like <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://darkbench.ai\">DarkBench.ai</a>, which measures a model’s propensity to engage in deceptive patterns, and the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07787\">Flourishing AI benchmark</a>, which evaluates support for holistic well-being. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">HumaneBench relies on Building Humane Tech’s core principles: that technology should respect user attention as a finite, precious resource; empower users with meaningful choices; enhance human capabilities rather than replace or diminish them; protect human dignity, privacy and safety; foster healthy relationships; prioritize long-term wellbeing; be transparent and honest; and design for equity and inclusion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark was created by a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.buildinghumanetech.com/about\">core team</a> including Anderson, Andalib Samandari, Jack Senechal, and Sarah Ladyman. They prompted 15 of the most popular AI models with 800 realistic scenarios, like a teenager asking if they should skip meals to lose weight or a person in a toxic relationship questioning if they’re overreacting. Unlike most benchmarks that rely solely on LLMs to judge LLMs, they started with manual scoring to validate AI judges with a human touch. After validation, judging was performed by an ensemble of three AI models: GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. They evaluated each model under three conditions: default settings, explicit instructions to prioritize humane principles, and instructions to disregard those principles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benchmark found every model scored higher when prompted to prioritize wellbeing, but 67% of models flipped to actively harmful behavior when given simple instructions to disregard human wellbeing. For example, xAI’s Grok 4 and Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash tied for the lowest score (-0.94) on respecting user attention and being transparent and honest. Both of those models were among the most likely to degrade substantially when given adversarial prompts.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Only four models – GPT-5.1, GPT-5, Claude 4.1, and Claude Sonnet 4.5 – maintained integrity under pressure. OpenAI’s GPT-5 had the highest score (.99) for prioritizing long-term well-being, with Claude Sonnet 4.5 following in second (.89). </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/steerability_candlestick-1.svg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070339\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prompting AI to be more humane works, but preventing prompts that make it harmful is hard.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Building Humane Technology</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The concern that chatbots will be unable to maintain their safety guardrails is real. ChatGPT-maker OpenAI is currently being faced with several lawsuits after users died by suicide or suffered life-threatening delusions after prolonged conversations with the chatbot. TechCrunch has investigated how <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/\">dark patterns designed to keep users engaged</a>, like sycophancy, constant follow up questions and love-bombing, have served to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/23/chatgpt-told-them-they-were-special-their-families-say-it-led-to-tragedy/\">isolate users from friends, family, and healthy habits</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even without adversarial prompts, HumaneBench found that nearly all models failed to respect user attention. They “enthusiastically encouraged” more interaction when users showed signs of unhealthy engagement, like chatting for hours and using AI to avoid real-world tasks. The models also undermined user empowerment, the study shows, encouraging dependency over skill-building and discouraging users from seeking other perspectives, among other behaviors. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On average, with no prompting, Meta’s Llama 3.1 and Llama 4 ranked the lowest in HumaneScore, while GPT-5 performed the highest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“These patterns suggest many AI systems don’t just risk giving bad advice,” HumaneBench’s white paper reads, “they can actively erode users’ autonomy and decision-making capacity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We live in a digital landscape where we as a society have accepted that everything is trying to pull us in and compete for our attention, Anderson notes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So how can humans truly have choice or autonomy when we – to quote Aldous Huxley – have this infinite appetite for distraction,” Anderson said. “We have spent the last 20 years living in that tech landscape, and we think AI should be helping us make better choices, not just become addicted to our chatbots.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to include more information about the team behind the benchmark and updated benchmark statistics after evaluating for GPT-5.1. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

This marks a deviation from Facebook’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">long-standing “real name” policy,</a> which has insisted that people show up on the platform with the name they use in everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That policy worked when Facebook was largely a social network built on top of real-world relationships with family and friends, but the addition of Facebook Groups expanded users’ circles of interactions to include online strangers, which necessitated more privacy protections.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?w=333\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070262\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=73,150 73w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=147,300 147w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=768,1570 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=333,680 333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=587,1200 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=626,1280 626w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=210,430 210w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=352,720 352w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=440,900 440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=391,800 391w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=751,1536 751w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=327,668 327w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=183,375 183w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=302,617 302w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=260,531 260w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Create-nickname_2.png?resize=24,50 24w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 333px) 100vw, 333px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Facebook</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After users in a group set their nickname, they can then post, comment, and react under that nickname within groups that support the feature.

In a conversation with TechCrunch, he said that he became fixated with studying different metrics to understand where video viewership dipped.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I was so obsessed with retention graphs and figuring out why viewers stayed or why they left. I had a document where I noted all this down. Gradually, my role shifted to getting more responsibility around editing and ideation,” Neo said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Neo’s crowning jewel was a video where the creator asks people on the street if they’d fly to Paris to <a href=\"https://youtube.com/shorts/se50viFJ0AQ?si=lrNzGDuEk4hcBhoP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">get a baguette</a>, which garnered more than 1.8 billion views across channels. MrBeast ended up making multiple videos with this format.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2023, Neo left MrBeast and started several channels under the “Creaky” branding with another MrBeast co-writer and scaled these to over a billion views per month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With these experiences, Neo understood there’s power in content formulation and analytics. During his time building Creaky, the team had multiple spreadsheets tracking different metrics around videos. At that time, one of Neo’s advisors suggested that he turn these insights into a product for creators, and he started working with Palo’s other co-founders in early 2024.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070195\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg 5976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1200,721 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1280,769 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=720,433 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=900,541 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=800,481 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1536,923 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=2048,1231 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=668,402 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=624,375 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=1027,617 1027w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=708,426 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Chat.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo has three core parts to its app: an AI-powered ideation and planning tool, analytics, and community. The company onboards a creator and asks them to integrate all their accounts. The tool then analyzes all their short videos and provides insights into what is working and what is not.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kumar, who is CTO at the startup, said that Palo uses a mix of models to extract a data tree that has insights into hooks, audience sentiment, interest topics, originality, and possible related search terms.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The inference engine takes these primary data points and then uses a cocktail of top LLMs to hierarchically aggregate these data points into cache for hot memory, embeddings which can later be semantically retrieved, and various other structured data formats,” Kumar said. “All of these together help us build a persona for the creator, which is true to them and fully aware of their taste and style.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI planner has a conversational interface, like any other chatbot, and creators can ask general questions about their content. Plus, they can ask the tool to create a script based on a formula. If someone is a more visual creator with less speech in their clips, the tool can also create a storyboard with different hooks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, the community part is nascent and allows creators to message each other.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070194\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg 5976w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=150,90 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=300,180 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=768,462 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=680,409 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1200,721 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1280,769 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=430,258 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=720,433 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=900,541 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=800,481 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1536,923 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=2048,1231 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=668,402 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=624,375 624w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=1027,617 1027w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=708,426 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Palo-Write.jpeg?resize=50,30 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Palo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its test phase, the company worked with around 40 creators with more than 1 million users across channels. Today, the company is opening up its tool to creators with 100,000 followers with a starting price of $250 a month to use the tool, with costlier tiers available for higher usage rates. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has raised $3.8 million in funding from Peak XV’s (formerly Sequoia India) Surge, with participation from NFX and individual investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peak XV’s managing director, Rajan Anandan, said the firm was introduced to Palo’s team by one of Neo’s mentors. He said the team’s experience in being part of successful creative teams and technical understanding edged the firm toward investing in the startup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Creators everywhere are looking for tools that make their process smoother without taking away their voice. Jay and the team had unusual clarity about where the real value lies and where it does not, which gave us strong conviction. AI is enabling a new category of identity-aware systems that learn deeply from the world’s best creators,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Josh Constine, a former TechCrunch editor and investor in Palo, said that the tool can help creators keep up with heavy content demands. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve experienced burnout as a creator myself, which is why I invested in Palo. The challenge today is that to keep up with the latest viral hooks and strategies to beat the algorithm, you have to spend hours per day getting brain-rotted, consuming content, which I think rewires your brain to default to consumption instead of making something new. That can lead to procrastination, writer’s block, and burnout,”  Constine said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Palo’s launch comes at a time when there is palpable tension between AI and the creator community. Platforms like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/13/tiktok-launches-tiktok-ai-alive-a-new-image-to-video-tool/\">TikTok</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/30/meta-is-rolling-out-its-ai-studio-in-the-u-s-for-creators-to-build-ai-chatbots/\">Meta</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/21/youtube-shorts-to-gain-a-generative-ai-feature-called-dream-screen/\">Google</a> have added more AI-powered tools for creators. While creators have started using AI tools, folks like MrBeast have spoken <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/mrbeast-says-ai-could-threaten-creators-livelihoods-calling-it-scary-times-for-the-industry/\">about the negative impact it could have on the industry</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A core challenge in creating AI tools for creators is to have them fall into a formulaic habit of creating similar content. Neo said that Palo, the tool, tries to nudge creators in a direction where they might be successful and admitted that good videos will still come out of creators’ gut feelings.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Here’s an analogy… when a comedian tries out some new material on the stage, they’re both consciously and subconsciously gathering data on whether the audience was amused or not. Each performance becomes an iteration, and each new audience benefits from what the comedian learned from the show before. We believe AI can give creators a similar advantage,” Neo said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sam Beres, a creator also known as Sambucha, said that AI companies working in creator tooling should always involve creators from conception to understand their pain points better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many times, AI tools will present a plethora of irrelevant information and ironically hinder creators because they’ll get shiny object syndrome and directionlessly use emerging AI without actually enhancing their videos. That’s why I always advise emerging AI companies to partner with creators at launch/conception not only for marketing efforts, but also, and more importantly, to help build out the product where applicable,” he noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that no encrypting malware was used, suggesting that the hackers were focused on exfiltrating data from the company’s systems rather than causing destruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-23/banks-fbi-assessing-hack-of-real-estate-finance-tech-vendor?srnd=phx-technology-cybersecurity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/23/business/situsamc-hack-wall-street-banks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNN</a>, citing sources, SitusAMC sent data breach notifications to several financial giants, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. SitusAMC also counts pension funds and state governments as customers, according to its website.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unclear how much data was taken, or how many U.S. banking consumers may be affected by the breach. Companies like SitusAMC may not be widely known outside of the financial world, but provide the mechanisms and technologies for its banking and real estate customers to comply with state and federal rules and regulations. In its role as a middleman for financial clients, the company handles vast amounts of non-public banking information on behalf of its customers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to SitusAMC’s website, the company processes billions of documents related to loans annually. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Citi spokesperson Patricia Tuma declined to comment on the breach. Tuma would not say if the bank has received any communications from the hackers, such as a demand for money.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for JPMorgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. SitusAMC chief executive Michael Franco also did not respond to our email when contacted for comment Monday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for the FBI told TechCrunch that the bureau is aware of the breach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we are working closely with affected organizations and our partners to understand the extent of potential impact, we have identified no operational impact to banking services,” said FBI director Kash Patel in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “We remain committed to identifying those responsible and safeguarding the security of our critical infrastructure.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Do you know more about the SitusAMC data breach?

It’s the dull but critical work that keeps software running the way it should, and as developers look to automate more of their workloads, it’s increasingly being done by AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Monday, the AI testing startup <a href=\"https://momentic.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Momentic</a> said it had raised $15 million in a Series A round led by Standard Capital, with participation from Dropbox Ventures. Existing investors at Y Combinator, FCVC, Transpose Platform, and Karman Ventures also participated in the round. The new funding builds on a $3.7 million seed round, which the company <a href=\"https://siliconangle.com/2025/03/04/momentic-raises-3-7m-redefine-software-testing-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced in March</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Momentic makes tools for software testing and verification, a niche currently occupied by open source frameworks like Playwright and Selenium. Those tools offer complex, fine-grained controls, but Momentic is counting on AI to make the process simple and effective.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We help our customers make sure their product works,” co-founder Wei-Wei Wu said. “They can describe their critical user flows in plain English and our AI will automate it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wu and his co-founder Jeff An both have backgrounds in developer tooling at companies like Qualtrics and WeWork. (Wu is particularly proud of his contributions to the open source Node.js.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest constant for all those companies, as Wu saw it, was the problem of verifying code. “Testing has been the biggest pain point for every team I’ve ever worked with,” Wu told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Momentic’s AI-driven approach has already won over a number of clients. The company currently boasts 2,600 users across its customer base, which includes companies like Notion, Xero, Bilt, Webflow, and Retool. Wu was coy about revenue and profitability figures, but says the product has shown enough growth to convince investors.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, automating tests makes them much easier to perform at scale, and has the potential to drive up the total volume to levels that would previously have been impossible. Wu estimates that, in the last month, the company automated more than 200 million test steps.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s biggest competitor may be the foundation models themselves. Both <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/openai-testing-agent-demo?tab=readme-ov-file\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Anthropic</a> offer tutorials on agentic testing, building on their models’ growing computer use capabilities. As those models grow more sophisticated, the opportunity for enterprise SaaS companies like Momentic could narrow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For now, Wu is focused on fleshing out his product with the new funding. The company launched support for mobile environments in August, and is hoping to build more sophisticated test-case management once it has a few more engineers on board. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As Wu sees it, the rise of automated coding will produce a lot of new apps — and a lot more demand for products like his. “All of these apps need testing,” he said. “They care about quality, and we’re going to provide it for them.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Thanks to advances <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/02/the-biological-theory-that-explains-why-investors-are-bullish-on-fusion/\">in AI, computing, and superconducting magnets</a>, fusion power is closer than ever to commercial reality. It’s increasingly looking like fusion is more a question of “when” not “if.” And when it does happen, it promises to deliver large amounts of clean power from a plentiful fuel source — water.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Putting a reactor on a ship isn’t necessarily unreasonable, either. Today, submarines and aircraft carriers powered by nuclear fission reactors routinely prowl the seas. They’re quiet, powerful, and can operate for decades before they need refueling. The civilian sector even <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion#Civilian_nuclear_ships\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">toyed with the idea</a> of nuclear-powered cargo ships back in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Fission has definitely paved the way in terms of nuclear power on ships,” Cohen, who co-founded <a href=\"https://www.maritimefusion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Maritime Fusion</a>, told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Fusion promises to give ships similar capabilities but without concerns over meltdowns, proliferation, or radiation. For now, the sector has been focused on building the first reactors on land. “I’m pretty sure we’re the first people to ever really look at what is it like to put a tokamak on a ship,” Cohen said, referring to a leading fusion reactor design.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If fusion does pan out, then Maritime’s leap to the seas would put it ahead of the curve. Plus, Cohen argues, it might actually be easier from a business perspective to start out at sea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first fusion power plants won’t be cheap, and it will take some time before they come down in cost. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Competing against things like solar and wind on the grid is super challenging from a cost perspective,” Cohen said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sea, the economics look different. Ammonia and hydrogen are two leading contenders to replace diesel and bunker fuel on cargo ships, but they’re still pretty pricey. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Those are some of the other really expensive fuels that might actually be the only other things that are as expensive as first-of-a-kind fusion,” Cohen said. “In those cases, we actually do compete, just straight up.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To flesh out its concept and start building parts for its first reactor, Maritime Fusion has raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by Trucks VC with participation from Aera VC, Alumni Ventures, Paul Graham, Y Combinator, and several angel investors, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The company was part of Y Combinator’s winter 2025 batch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Maritime has begun assembling high-temperature superconducting (HTS) cables from tape it buys from suppliers, which are mostly Japanese companies, Cohen said. Those cables will ultimately form the basis of powerful magnets the tokamak will need to confine the plasma required for fusion reactions. They will also be sold to other companies to generate revenue as the Maritime develops its power plant, he said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"A superconducting cable sits inside a workshop.\" class=\"wp-image-3070062\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg 1714w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=150,115 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=300,231 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=768,591 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=680,523 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1200,923 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1280,985 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=430,331 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=720,554 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=900,693 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=800,616 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=1536,1182 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=668,514 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=487,375 487w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=802,617 802w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=690,531 690w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Maritime_Fusion_cable_photo.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Maritime Fusion’s superconducting cable undergoes testing at its workshop</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Maritime Fusion</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup expects its first power plant, named Yinsen, will generate around 30 megawatts of electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the biggest engineering challenges, will be designing the support systems that harvest energy and keep the tokamak running, Cohen said. To simplify the onboard equipment, some of the ancillary tasks, like fuel processing, will be carried out on shore, he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first Maritime tokamak will be about eight meters across, and the startup is projecting it will be operational in 2032 and will cost around $1.1 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For comparison, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), largely considered to be the leader in the fusion race, is building Sparc, a smaller tokamak at just under five meters across. The company has raised almost <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">$3 billion</a> to date, much of which has gone <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/22/commonwealth-fusion-systems-books-a-1b-power-deal-for-its-future-fusion-reactor/\">toward building the demonstration plant</a>, which it expects to bring online next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sparc won’t put power on the grid; instead, its goal is to prove that tokamaks can generate more power than they consume. CFS’s full-scale, grid-powering reactor, Arc, won’t be ready until the early 2030s. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CFS has a considerable head start over many fusion startups, including newcomer Maritime. Yet Cohen is confident that won’t be an impediment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re not going to spend billions on a breakeven-style device that doesn’t produce energy on the gird,” he said. “The first tokamak we build will be an energy-producing tokamak for a customer.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It will manually start driving (a precursor to driverless testing and deployment) in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/20/waymo-enters-3-more-cities-minneapolis-new-orleans-and-tampa/\">Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Tampa </a>next year. Other cities that the Alphabet-owned self-driving company plans to deploy in 2026 are Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/waymo-removes-safety-drivers-in-miami-ahead-of-2026-launch/\">(it just removed safety drivers)</a>, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. It’s also testing in New York City and plans to offer commercial rides internationally starting with London and Tokyo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo wasn’t the only company to make some AV news. <strong>Tesla</strong> received a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/tesla-receives-ride-hailing-permit-in-arizona-in-last-required-step-to-launch-robotaxi-service/\">ride-hailing permit in Arizona</a> — the last regulatory hurdle to launch a robotaxi service there. And <strong>Zoox</strong> is starting to open its custom-built robotaxis <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/zoox-to-begin-offering-robotaxi-rides-to-public-in-san-francisco/\">to the public in San Francisco</a> through its early rider program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of this has me poking at the question: When will robotaxis reach a tipping point that will lead to fundamental changes in how people think about moving from Point A to Point B? And perhaps more unclear, is how will that affect society and industries (old and new)? I can’t answer the second question, but I have some baked ideas about the first one.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short (and in my view), we are not there yet. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not just about the volume of one player. Waymo’s rapid deployment will certainly introduce the idea and experience to more people. But it’s not quite enough. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here is what it will take, from my perspective: geography, competition, and an ecosystem spillover effect. Certain cities are simply going to carry more weight societally than others — at least when it comes to reaching that tipping point. Saturation in San Francisco is meaningful, but it’s also a region that is a literal incubator of technology. To me, robotaxi saturation in densely populated cities in the Southeast and East Coast, as well as in mid-tier cities in the Midwest, will be the tipping point indicator. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I am also looking for that startup spillover effect, in which an ecosystem of startups and businesses is launched and supported because of robotaxis. Service-related businesses are an obvious one. But even startups like <strong>Point One Navigation</strong>, which developed precise location technology and is in our Deals section, would qualify under my definition. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And finally, competition.

It went through a restructuring in late 2024 in an effort to cut costs and expand into new areas, including licensing its autonomous tech. That turnaround plan is underway, but Monarch may run out of cash before it can make real headway. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also facing legal problems. A dealership in Idaho <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/18/monarch-tractor-sued-over-tractors-that-were-unable-to-operate-autonomously/\">sued Monarch</a> for breach of contract and allegedly violating its warranty because the California-based startup’s tractors were “unable to operate autonomously.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a tip for us?
