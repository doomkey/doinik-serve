The two companies will divide the assets: Ford will take ownership and operation of the twin battery plants in Kentucky, while SK On will operate the factory at the massive BlueOval SK campus in Tennessee.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SK On said it will maintain a strategic partnership with Ford centered on the Tennessee plant, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-11/ford-agrees-to-break-up-us-battery-venture-with-cell-partner-sk\">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, a Ford spokesperson told TechCrunch the company was aware of SK’s disclosure and had nothing further to share at this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The joint venture was created when the industry was investing billions of dollars to ramp up electric vehicle production. While EV sales have risen over the past several years, demand has not kept up with the industry’s lofty projections. The end of the federal EV tax credit has also dampened the pace of sales.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

Daigle said Freedom Chat’s servers allowed anyone to flood it with millions of phone number guesses to determine if a user’s phone number was stored on the servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Per Daigle, this technique is identical to one <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.univie.ac.at/en/news/detail/forscherinnen-entdecken-grosse-sicherheitsluecke-in-whatsapp\">described by the University of Vienna</a> in research last month, where <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/a-simple-whatsapp-security-flaw-exposed-billions-phone-numbers/\">academics scraped</a> data on some 3.5 billion user accounts who signed up to WhatsApp by matching billions of phone numbers against WhatsApp’s servers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Daigle also found Freedom Chat was leaking users’ PIN codes. Using an open-source network traffic inspection tool to analyze the data going in and out of the app, Daigle saw that the app would respond with the PIN codes of every other user in the same public channel — even if the PINs weren’t visible to users within the app itself.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Daigle, anyone who was in the default Freedom Chat channel, which users are automatically subscribed to when they first sign up, had their PIN broadcast to everyone else in the channel. Daigle told TechCrunch that knowledge of a person’s PIN could allow someone to open the app from a user’s stolen device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an app store update published Sunday, Freedom Chat noted: “A critical reset: A recent backend update inadvertently exposed user PINs in a system response. No messages were ever at risk, and because Freedom Chat does not support linked devices, your conversations were never accessible; however, we’ve reset all user PINs to ensure your account stays secure. Your privacy remains our top priority.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Freedom Chat is Haas’ second messaging app, after Converso, which was delisted from app stores following the disclosure of <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://crnkovic.dev/testing-converso/\">security flaws</a> that exposed users’ private messages and content.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Now, the startup has proven its technology works and is seeing demand from wind farms and beyond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Oslo, Norway-based Spoor has built software that uses computer vision to track and identify bird populations and migration patterns. The software can detect birds within a 2.5-kilometer radius (about 1.5 miles) and can work with any off-the-shelf high-resolution camera.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wind farm operators can use this information to better plan where wind farms should be located and to help them better navigate migration patterns. For example, a wind farm could slow down its turbines, or even stop them entirely, during heavy periods of local migration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ask Helseth (pictured above left), the co-founder and CEO of Spoor, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/16/spoor-uses-ai-to-save-birds-from-wind-turbines/\">told TechCrunch</a> last year that he got interested in this space after learning that wind farms lacked effective tracking methods, despite many countries having strict rules around where wind farms can be built and how they can operate due to local bird populations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The expectations from the regulators are growing but the industry doesn’t have a great tool,” Helseth said at the time. “A lot of people [go out] in the field with binoculars and trained dogs to find out how many birds are colliding with the turbines.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helseth told TechCrunch last week that since then, the company has proven the need for this technology and worked to make it better.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074781\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png 4250w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=150,95 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=300,191 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=768,488 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=680,432 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1200,763 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1280,814 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=430,273 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=720,458 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=900,572 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=800,509 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=1536,977 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=2048,1302 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=668,425 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=590,375 590w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=970,617 970w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=708,450 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Spoor-photo-1.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Courtesy: Spoor</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time of its seed raise in 2024, Spoor was able to track birds in a 1-kilometer range, which has since doubled. As the company has collected more data to feed into its AI model, it has been able to improve its bird identification accuracy to about 96%.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Identifying the species of the bird for some of the clients, you add another layer,” Helseth said. “Is it a bird or not a bird? We have an in-house ornithologist to help train the model to train the new types of birds or a new type of species. Having deployment in other countries [means] having rare species in the database.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spoor now works across three continents and with more than 20 of the world’s largest energy companies. It has also started to see interest from other industries such as airports and aquaculture farms. Spoor has a partnership with Rio Tinto, a London-based mining giant, to track bats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also received interest in using its tech to track other objects of similar size — but Helseth said they aren’t thinking of pivoting into those areas quite yet.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Drones are of course a plastic bird in our mind,” Helseth joked. “They move in a different way and have a different shape and size. Currently we are discarding that data but we are getting interest in it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spoor recently raised an €8 million ($9.3 million) Series A round led by SET Ventures with participation from Ørstead Ventures and Superorganism in addition to strategic investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helseth predicts that interest in this type of technology will only grow as regulators continue to crack down on wind farms. For example, <a href=\"https://www.yahoo.com/news/french-energy-giant-ordered-switch-212220642.html\">French regulators shut down a wind farm</a> in April due to its impact on the local bird population and imposed hundreds of millions of fines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our mission is to enable industry and nature to coexist,” Helseth said. “We have started on that journey, but we are still a small startup with a lot to prove. In the coming years, we want to really cement our position in the wind industry and become a global leader to tackle these challenges. At the same time, we want to build some proof points that this technology has value beyond that main category.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rather than pump harder or inject something to force oil to the surface, Eclipse sends down microbes to munch on the oil molecules and liberate their hydrogen. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Instead of viscous oil, companies only have to deal with hydrogen gas. “Hydrogen flows a lot easier,” Sekhon said, making it easier to extract it from the well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Houston-based startup, which was spun out of Cemvita, demonstrated the technology at an oilfield in California’s San Joaquin Basin last summer. Now, it’s partnering with oilfield services company Weatherford International to deploy the technology around the world, the startup exclusively told TechCrunch. The first projects will begin in January.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They’re an extension of our team,” Sekhon said to characterize the relationship with Weatherford. “They’ll be our operational arm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Eclipse, which was previously known as Gold H2, has been developing the technology over the last several years. It has been sampling microbes that naturally occur in oil wells, which live at the interface between oil and water held in aquifers, to find those that are best suited to the job.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the microbes consume the oil, they break it down into hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Both then flow to the surface, where Eclipse and its partners will eventually separate the two. About half of the carbon dioxide is likely to stay in the reservoir, while the other half could be captured using specialized equipment and either sequestered or used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal, Sekhon said, is to produce low-carbon hydrogen for around 50 cents per kilogram, or the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-hydrogen-review-2021/executive-summary\">same price</a> as hydrogen obtained by breaking down natural gas in an industrial plant, a process that releases more carbon dioxide.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The resulting hydrogen could be used in petrochemical plants or burned for energy. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s taking a liability and turning it into a clean energy asset,” Sekhon said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

They want it to take care of the release management,” Einy told TechCrunch. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But if agents are connected to all kinds of different tools and data sources, if the data is scattered among them, if they have no way to collaborate, and have no corporate standards and guardrails, “it creates chaos,” his product pitch goes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Port therefore offers more than just a catalog of dev and agent tools (although it does offer that). It supplies a layer of orchestration with features that measure agent performance and add a human-in-the-loop, as desired, to approval processes.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A feature called “context lake” defines the data sources, context memory, and guardrails for agents. “It’s where you manage what agents ‘need to know’ to do their job safely and correctly,” Einy explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using Port to catalog agents devs have already created using other tools, they can use Port to create new agents. Plus, Port also offers a few of its own ready-made agents, which can do things like resolving helpdesk tickets and dealing with provisioning. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Einy describes his product as handling the other 90% of what software programmers do that isn’t writing code. “It gives the engineers a user interface to control the agent, to iterate with the agent, to approve what it does that is not coding, that is all the 90%.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With its giant new war chest of cash, big name customers and tier-one VCs, Port looks like an agentic management startup to watch. But to say it faces competition is an understatement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The entire category of agentic management and orchestration is flooded with hopefuls, from big tech companies to startups, and they’re all coming at the various new problems in the space from different angles. A few of these include <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/open-source-agentic-startup-langchain-hits-1-25b-valuation/\">LangChain</a>, UiPath, Cortex and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Flaviu Radulescu started Runware in 2023 when he was testing a text-to-image company and realized that, though genAI tech was powerful, it was slow in generating images. So Radulescu teamed up with Ioana Hreninciuc and launched Runware as a dev tool platform that specializes in generating images, videos, and audio in real time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has seen much growth since it first launched. It has powered more than 10 billion creations for more than 200,000 developers, the company told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The product lets developers integrate Runware’s API into their apps and then generate media assets through one interface, so they don’t have to set up any new infrastructure or maintain separate integrations. It has a custom AI inference infrastructure for open-source models, and provides day-zero access (meaning as soon as a model is released, it can run on Runware) and competitive pricing, Hreninciuc, who focuses on operations and GTM, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Thursday, the company announced a $50 million Series A in a round led by Dawn Capital. Dawn Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/18/dawn-capitals-shamillah-bankiya-breaks-down-the-state-of-the-euro-venture-market/\">Partner Shamillah Bankiya</a> is joining the board. Others in the round include Comcast Ventures, Speedinvest, Insight Partners and a16z Speedrun. Runware has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/01/runware-uses-custom-hardware-and-advanced-orchestration-for-fast-ai-inference/\">raised $66 million in funding to date</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the company remains competitive through its pricing, which is “more-cost effective,” in addition to having a fully unified API. She said the company does this with its Sonic Inference Engine, which runs on custom AI hardware. It also partners with third-party AI cloud providers so that it can reroute workloads automatically in case more memory is needed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“On the software side, we heavily optimize model loading and offloading, which lets us support over 400,000 models and make any of them available for inference in real time,” she continued.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Startups that focus on dev tools for image and video have been a particularly hot market for VC interest lately. Fal.ai, for instance, just raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/fal-nabs-140m-in-fresh-funding-led-by-sequoia-tripling-valuation-to-4-5b/\">$140 million at a $4.5 billion valuation</a>, its second giant raise in a matter of months. Fal.ai focuses on the breadth of model offerings versus customizing for speed. So, Hreninciuc considers her competitors to be Fal.ai and Replicate, a startup that runs open-source models in apps with just a few lines of code.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These companies, as Radulescu previously told TechCrunch, sell based on GPU compute time. Runware instead leans toward the model of Stable Diffusion and Flux, offering a more cost-per-image generated so that people can pay for what they need rather than buying a block of compute time. <strong> </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hreninciuc said the fresh capital will be used to keep expanding the company’s infrastructure and it hopes to use its Sonic Inference Engine to power over 2 million models. The big goal is to be the API for all AI — so that any generative AI model can and does run on the platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re also expanding rapidly into new modalities,” she said, adding that the company is going to expand the current team of around 25 to help make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overall, Hreninciuc hopes Runware continues to “make it possible for applications to scale to millions of users while actually keeping their margins,” she said, adding that it helps make the market more affordable. That “benefits everyone,” she continued. “From the app builders to the end users, and puts powerful AI into more people’s hands globally.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This piece was updated to correct the spelling of Radulescu</em>‘s<em> name</em> <em>and to update what the competitors are</em>, <em>and who else participated in the round. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The tender offer is intended to provide some liquidity to its long-term employees, Bansal said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new valuation is a 49% jump from its <a href=\"https://www.harness.io/blog/harness-valuation-soars-to-3-7-billion-with-230-million-in-series-d-funding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3.7 billion valuation</a> in a $230 million round in April 2022. With this funding, the startup has raised $570 million of equity to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI accelerates code production, it is widening a bottleneck in the far larger “after-code” phase of software development — the testing, security checks, and deployment work that still consumes nearly 70% of engineering time. Harness’s tools help automate this sprawling, error-prone layer, even as enterprises grapple with rising AI code volume and the risks of shipping even a single line of faulty software into production systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bansal is well known among developers for building and selling app performance company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/24/cisco-snaps-up-appdynamics-for-3-7b-right-before-its-ipo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AppDynamics to Cisco for $3.7 billion</a> in 2017. So the post-coding world is an area Bansal knows well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness uses AI agents to automate functions like testing, verification, security, and governance. It is built on a software delivery knowledge graph that maps code changes, services, deployments, tests, environments, incidents, policies, and costs. The knowledge graph helps differentiate Harness from other AI platforms, Bansal said, because it gives the system a deep understanding of each customer’s software delivery processes and architecture.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This knowledge graph is the context that our AI agents use,” he told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The purpose-built agents draw on that context to generate pipelines that match each customer’s specific policies, architecture and operational requirements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness also uses an orchestration engine that turns the AI’s recommendations into automated actions, with checks in place to make sure those changes are applied safely.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074986\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1200,656 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1280,699 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=430,235 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=720,393 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=900,492 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=800,437 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1536,839 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=668,365 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=1129,617 1129w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=708,387 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harness-ai.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Harness</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As AI is not foolproof, Bansal said the system is designed with human oversight, noting that AI-generated tests or fixes are reviewed by engineers, compliance teams, or auditors before being put into use.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft’s GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, and CloudBees are among the key competitors for Harness. But Harness has plenty of traction, claiming more than 1,000 enterprise customers, including United Airlines, Morningstar, Keller Williams and National Australia Bank. So far, the startup has handled 128 million deployments, 81 million builds, protected 1.2 trillion API calls, and helped customers optimize $1.9 billion in cloud spending over the past year, Bansal touts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco–based company employs over 1,200 people across 14 offices worldwide, including in Europe and the U.K. Around 33% of its workforce is in India, where it has a large engineering team in Bengaluru and a corporate office in Gurugram. Moreover, the Bengaluru site is Harness’s biggest development center outside the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harness plans to use the new funding to expand its R&amp;D efforts, hire “hundreds of engineers” at its Bengaluru office, and build out additional automated testing, deployment, and security capabilities while improving the accuracy of its AI systems. The company also intends to strengthen its U.S. go-to-market operations and significantly expand its presence in international markets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It should also be noted that earlier this year, Bansal <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/10/appdynamics-founder-jyoti-bansal-merges-startups-harness-traceable-.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">merged his software observability firm Traceable</a> with Harness, and that move has helped the startup grow its ARR projection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We brought the two companies together because we started to see that DevOps and application security are coming together in a very, very deep way,” said Bansal. “We have seen that turned out to be a very, very successful thesis this year … that’s driving a lot of growth for both of our DevOps and application security set of products.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this raise has allowed some employees to cash out a bit,  Bansal still plans on taking Harness public one day, he said, though he did not share a specific timeline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“That’s what our goals and plans depend on,” he said of an eventual IPO. “Our business is very, very healthy, very strong, high growth and margins, and it will be a great public company when the timing is right.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a signal of just how critical this work has become as Google pours up to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/29/google-expects-significant-increase-in-capex-in-2026-execs-say.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$93 billion</a> into capital expenditures by the end of 2025 — a number that parent company Alphabet expects will be a whole lot bigger next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat isn’t new to the game. The computer scientist, who holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and started as a research intern at Xerox PARC back in the early ’90s, has been quietly building Google’s AI backbone for the past 15 years. Before joining Google in 2010 as an engineering fellow and VP, he was an associate professor at Duke University and later a professor and SAIC Chair at UC San Diego. His academic credentials are formidable — with what appears to be around <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r3aWCRUAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">395 published papers</a> — and his research has always focused on making computers work more efficiently at massive scale.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat already maintains a high profile with Google. Just eight months ago, at Google Cloud Next, he took the stage to unveil the company’s seventh-generation TPU, called Ironwood, in his role as VP and GM of ML, Systems, and Cloud AI. The specs he rattled off at the event were staggering, too: over 9,000 chips per pod delivering 42.5 exaflops of compute — more than 24 times the power of the world’s No. 1 supercomputer at the time, he said. “Demand for AI compute has increased by a factor of 100 million in just eight years,” he told the audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Behind the scenes, as noted by Semafor, Vahdat has been orchestrating the unglamorous and essential work that keeps Google competitive, including those custom TPU chips for AI training and inference that give Google an edge over rivals like OpenAI, as well as the Jupiter network, the super-fast internal network that allows all its servers to talk to each other and move massive amounts of data around. (In a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/speed-scale-reliability-25-years-of-data-center-networking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> late last year, Vahdat said that Jupiter now scales to 13 petabits per second, explaining that’s enough bandwidth to theoretically support a video call for all 8 billion people on Earth simultaneously.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vahdat has also been deeply involved in the ongoing development of the Borg software system, Google’s cluster management system that acts as the brain coordinating all the work happening across its data centers. And he has said he oversaw the development of Axion, Google’s first custom Arm-based general-purpose CPUs designed for data centers, which the company <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-googles-new-arm-based-cpu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unveiled last year</a> and continues to build.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In short, Vahdat is central to Google’s AI story.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Indeed, in a market where top AI talent commands astronomical compensation and constant recruitment, Google’s decision to elevate Vahdat to the C-suite may also be about retention. When you’ve spent 15 years building someone into a linchpin of your AI strategy, you make sure they stay.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Anthropic, Apple, Chai AI, Character Technologies, Luka, Meta, Nomi AI, Perplexity AI, Replika, and xAI were also included in the letter.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter comes as <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/28/the-race-to-regulate-ai-has-sparked-a-federal-vs-state-showdown/\">a fight over AI regulations has been brewing</a> between state and federal government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Those safeguards include transparent third-party audits of large language models that look for signs of delusional or sycophantic ideations, as well as new incident reporting procedures designed to notify users when chatbots produce psychologically harmful outputs. Those third parties, which could include academic and civil society groups, should be allowed to “evaluate systems pre-release without retaliation and to publish their findings without prior approval from the company,” the letter states.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“GenAI has the potential to change how the world works in a positive way. But it also has caused—and has the potential to cause—serious harm, especially to vulnerable populations,” the letter states, pointing to a number of well-publicized incidents over the past year — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/07/seven-more-families-are-now-suing-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-suicides-delusions/\">suicides</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/chatgpt-ai-stein-erik-soelberg-murder-suicide-6b67dbfb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqfX0F2icZLVyVm8juM24tvn9WMyILlVGuXVZJtA36Wsfv71gvMTzXglo1QkYrs%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6939fefc&amp;gaa_sig=qD2aVPLhLDJ6yZOABEDGfOuMap-04pCgiJaUqTcZJ04UOQficfvHOOPTZ3ui8WocNfCKbo7MEiGaidYx9iwDHA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">murder</a> — in which violence has been linked to excessive AI use, the letter states. “In many of these incidents, the GenAI products generated sycophantic and delusional outputs that either encouraged users’ delusions or assured users that they were not delusional.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AGs also suggest companies treat mental health incidents the same way tech companies handle cybersecurity incidents — with clear and transparent incident reporting policies and procedures. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Companies should develop and publish “detection and response timelines for sycophantic and delusional outputs,” the letter states. In a similar fashion to how data breaches are currently handled, companies should also “promptly, clearly, and directly notify users if they were exposed to potentially harmful sycophantic or delusional outputs,” the letter says. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another ask is that the companies develop “reasonable and appropriate safety tests” on GenAI models to “ensure the models do not produce potentially harmful sycophantic and delusional outputs.” These tests should be conducted before the models are ever offered to the public, it adds.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch was unable to reach Google, Microsoft, or OpenAI for comment prior to publication. The article will be updated if the companies respond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies developing AI have had a much warmer reception at the federal level. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration has made it known it is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/trumps-ai-strategy-trades-guardrails-for-growth-in-race-against-china/\">unabashedly pro-AI</a>, and, over the past year, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/another-bid-to-block-state-ai-regulation-has-failedfor-now/\">multiple attempts</a> have been made to pass a nationwide moratorium on state-level AI regulations.

That’s at least how the company is framing the launch of its new “Promoted Playlists,” a feature that will initially be available to Premium subscribers in New Zealand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature, which is currently available in English only, is still in beta and will evolve before rolling out to other markets, according to Spotify.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new tool allows users to describe what they want to hear in a personalized playlist that reflects the “full arc” of their tastes, according to the company. That means the playlist focuses not only on the songs you like now, but your entire Spotify listening history from day one — something that differentiates the feature from other playlists, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is an evolution from Spotify’s existing AI playlist option, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/07/spotify-launches-personalized-ai-playlists-you-can-build-using-prompts/\">which debuted last year</a>, and also works through written prompts. As with AI playlists, the new Prompted Playlists allow users to request what they want to hear with written instructions. However, they can now write much longer prompts with more specific instructions. That’s because the new AI feature factors in world knowledge, a rep from Spotify explained to TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, the ability to go further back in your listening history and schedule how often the playlist refreshes makes it different from Spotify’s other AI playlist offerings. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Spotify suggests subscribers can use the new feature to ask for something like, “music from my top artists from the last five years,” then amend the prompt to include a request for “deep cuts I haven’t heard yet.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Prompted-Playlist-GIF-102924.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3074890\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Spotify</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another example of a longer prompt, Spotify said you could ask for “high-energy pop and hip-hop for a 30-minute 5K run that keeps a steady pace before easing into relaxing songs for a cool-down” or “music from this year’s biggest films and most-talked-about TV shows that match my taste.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, you can continue to fine-tune the prompt to make it even more specific, and can set how often you want it to refresh, like daily or weekly. The idea is that users can essentially make their own version of something like Spotify’s flagship playlist, Discover Weekly, but one that’s focused on a type of music, genre, or time period they’d like to track, or their own version of something like Spotify’s genre-focused Daily Mixes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says the playlist will include descriptions and context so you know why you’re getting the recommendation. Plus, it will offer a set of prompts to help users get started.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spotify isn’t the only social app pitching how it’s letting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/10/instagrams-new-your-algorithm-tool-gives-you-more-control-over-the-reels-you-see/\">users take control of its algorithm</a>. Instagram today also introduced a new feature that lets users control what type of reels they see. Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, also lets users swap out its algorithm for one of their own. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It will then use infrared lasers to transmit that power to utility-scale solar farms on Earth, allowing them to send power to the grid nearly round the clock. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.overviewenergy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Overview</a> has raised $20 million to date, and part of that money has gone toward an airborne demonstration of its power-beaming technology. A light aircraft transmitted power using a laser to a ground receiver over a distance of 5 kilometers (3 miles).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors include the Aurelia Institute, Earthrise Ventures, Engine Ventures, EQT Foundation, Lowercarbon Capital, and Prime Movers Lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As space launch costs have declined over the past decade or so, space-based power has gone from pure science fiction to something closer to reality. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are still several hurdles to overcome: For one, it’s still significantly cheaper to deploy solar panels here on Earth than to send them into space. And the ability to send power wirelessly from orbit down to our planet’s surface is still in its infancy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies are attempting the same feat. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/02/space-solar-startup-aetherflux-raises-50m-to-launch-first-space-demo-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aetherflux</a> is also pursuing a laser-based approach.

But because microwave-based systems can’t reuse existing solar farms, they would have to build their own ground stations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To keep costs down, those ground receivers would probably be smaller, so the energy beams would have to be tighter and more powerful. Companies are developing ways to swiftly interrupt the beam to prevent collateral damage to birds and aircraft, but it’s still a concern.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Overview’s reuse of solar farms would mitigate some of those concerns, though it would still have to convince the public that energy beams from space are safe and won’t stray off target. (<a href=\"https://simcity.fandom.com/wiki/Microwave_(disaster)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Remember SimCity 2000?</a>) The company will also have to ensure its laser system is very efficient; otherwise the benefit of collecting sunlight in space will evaporate as the energy is converted to infrared light and back again.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup says that in 2028 it intends to launch a satellite into low Earth orbit — far below the 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) at which it ultimately intends to operate. If all goes as planned, it’ll start sending megawatts’ worth of power from geosynchronous orbit in 2030.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If it sounds audacious, it is. Overview isn’t just confronting some promising but potentially unforgiving physics problems but will also be battling grid-scale batteries, which are getting <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cheaper every year</a>, and potentially nuclear fusion.

SpaceX reported the incident to OSHA, and the agency opened a “rapid response investigation,” according to Joanna Hawkins, deputy regional director of public affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rapid response investigations typically involve OSHA asking an employer for more information before determining if the agency will perform an on-site inspection. Hawkins said OSHA is still waiting for SpaceX’s response to that request.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is the second known crane-related accident at Starbase this year that OSHA is probing. The agency also opened an investigation into a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2025/06/26/spacex-crane-collapse-in-texas-being-investigated-by-osha.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">crane that collapsed at Starbase in late June</a>. It’s still not known if any workers were injured during that accident; neither SpaceX nor Starbase city officials have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/27/spacexs-starbase-city-officials-silent-on-crane-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commented on the collapse</a>, which was caught on livestreamed video by LabPadre.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The crane-related accidents are part of a growing list of incidents at the rapidly expanding launch facility in South Texas as CEO Elon Musk has pushed his company to develop massive rockets that can go to the moon and Mars.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-broken-hip-knee-and-tibia\">A broken hip, knee, and tibia</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers for Cavazos, a resident of Cameron County, Texas, filed his <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26366547-eduardo-cavazos-v-ccc-group-inc-space-exploration-technologies-corp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lawsuit</a> in November just a few days after the accident. They said he was working as a subcontractor of CCC Group, which was hired by SpaceX to construct concrete walls at the Starbase site. On November 15, a crane operator was lifting a “vertical formwork” — which holds wet concrete in place until it dries — when one of the long metal supports “detached” and landed on him, Cavazos’ lawyers claim in the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26367469-1st-amended-petition-eduardo-cavazos-with-tro-language/\">amended petition</a> filed this week, Cavazos’ lawyers claim another CCC Group employee was operating the crane and was seen using a cell phone around the time of the accident. The operator “recklessly lowered” the formwork, causing it to strike the ground and surprising Cavazos and two other workers. The operator then suddenly lifted the formwork up, according to the complaint, which is when the 1,200-pound support struck Cavazos.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The metal support broke Cavazos’ hip, knee, and tibia, and he suffered other injuries to his neck, head, shoulders, back, and legs. “In all reasonable probability, [Cavazos] has and/or will undergo physical therapy, daily medications, pain management treatment, and/or surgical intervention in an attempt to control the pain caused by the injuries sustained in this incident,” his lawyers wrote in the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cavazos sued both CCC Group and SpaceX for negligence and is seeking unspecified damages. He claims both companies should be held responsible for not verifying the metal support was properly attached, and failing to properly warn workers of this type of hazard on the site, among other alleged safety violations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Representatives for CCC Group and SpaceX did not respond to requests for comment. Cavazos’ lawyers declined to comment beyond the contents of the complaint.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-starbase-s-safety-record\">Starbase’s safety record</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Workers have sustained serious injuries at SpaceX’s Starbase facility for years. In 2023, a Reuters report about the safety of Starbase <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/spacex-musk-safety/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">uncovered</a> numerous previously unreported injuries, as well as the fact that an employee died at the South Texas site in 2014 when construction began.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Publicly available data shows the site continues to be dangerous in comparison to other SpaceX facilities and those run by its rivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/18/spacex-worker-injury-rates-at-starbase-outpace-industry-rivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch analysis</a> of OSHA data this past July found Starbase had a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of around 4.27 injuries per 100 workers in 2024. SpaceX’s McGregor, Texas rocket testing facility had a TRIR of 2.48 in 2024, and its Hawthorne, California site measured out at 1.43. The TRIR for aerospace manufacturing as a whole in 2024 was 1.6 injuries per 100 workers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Former OSHA chief of staff Debbie Berkowitz told TechCrunch at the time that Starbase’s TRIR “is a red flag that there are serious safety issues that need to be addressed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Transparency at Starbase is difficult, too. Companies are supposed to report serious injuries to OSHA within 24 hours if they involve hospitalizations, amputations, or the loss of an eye. While it appears SpaceX did so in the case of Cavazos, OSHA penalized SpaceX $7,000 in early June for not reporting a different injury at Starbase that fell into one of those categories. SpaceX contested the penalty and the two sides reached an undisclosed settlement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SpaceX has been building out Starbase for more than a decade, but the company has big plans to expand the facility in the coming years. It’s currently constructing a $250 million, 700,000-square-foot rocket factory called “Gigabay” that it expects to finish by the end of 2026. The company <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1987755769899708433\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has said</a> it could be used to make as many as 1,000 Starship rockets per year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The pressure has only been mounting on SpaceX, too. Acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy recently chastised the company for not moving quickly enough to return astronauts to the moon, <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1875023335891026324\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">after</a> Musk called lunar missions “a distraction” from Mars. Duffy suggested NASA may opt to use rockets from Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin to land people on the moon before China, which is expected to attempt the feat in 2029.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story has been updated with new information from Cavazos’ amended petition. </em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
