And now, before this robotaxi joins Waymo’s official commercial fleet, it’s getting a new name, the company told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT robotaxi will now be named Ojai (pronounced “oh-hi”) — after the village in the Topatopa Mountains above Los Angeles that is known for its arts community and focus on wellness. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo’s official explanation, per spokesperson Chris Bonelli, is that the company determined the U.S. public isn’t familiar with the Zeekr brand. That branding may even carry through to the rider experience. Apparently, when customers eventually get into the Ojai, the robotaxi will greet them with an “Oh hi” and their name. Cute. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, in the U.S. it might not hurt to ditch the name of a Chinese automaker either. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For those unfamiliar, Waymo first <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/28/waymo-partners-with-geely-to-make-electric-avs-for-ride-hail-in-the-us/\">struck a partnership</a> with Geely Holding Group-owned Zeekr in 2021. Waymo showed off a concept of a purpose-built robotaxi the following year at a splashy event in Los Angeles. The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/inside-the-waymo-zeekr-robotaxi-bird-spirals-and-layoffs-come-to-nuro/\">prototype</a> was based on a version of Zeekr’s  SEA-M architecture designed for “future mobility products” like robotaxis and logistics vehicles. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the prototype didn’t have a steering wheel. But the Ojai one, which was shown off at CES 2026, does.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Zeekr RT (now Ojai) has gone through some fine-tuning over the years as it has gone through development and testing in cities like Phoenix and San Francisco. Last year at CES, Waymo gave the robotaxi the now-retired name of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/07/zeekr-rt-the-robotaxi-built-for-waymo-has-the-tiniest-wipers/\">Zeekr RT</a> and showcased some of its hardware, including 13 cameras, four lidar, six radar, an array of external audio receivers, and the tiniest sensor wipers you’ve ever seen. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That hardware suite is the same. But the paint color has been tweaked, according to the company. Waymo told TechCrunch the paint color, which had a blueish tint, is now more silver. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">All of these final tweaks have happened ahead of Ojai’s imminent launch into commercial service. Waymo employees, and their family and friends, are now able to hail the Zeekr van in San Francisco and Phoenix — typically one of the last steps before it becomes available to the public. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Waymo is in the midst of a rapid expansion. The company, which offers a commercial robotaxi service in Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, plans to launch in a dozen more cities over the next year. Those cities include Denver, Las Vegas, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/15/waymo-plans-to-launch-a-robotaxi-service-in-london-in-2026/\">London</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The parties have agreed in principle to settle; now comes the harder work of finalizing the details.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These are among the first settlements in lawsuits accusing AI companies of harming users, a legal frontier that must have OpenAI and Meta watching nervously from the wings as they defend themselves against similar lawsuits. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Character.AI founded in 2021 by ex-Google engineers who <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/02/character-ai-ceo-noam-shazeer-returns-to-google/\">returned</a> to their former employer in 2024 in a $2.7 billion deal, invites users to chat with AI personas. The most haunting case involves Sewell Setzer III, who at age 14 conducted sexualized conversations with a “Daenerys Targaryen” bot before killing himself. His mother, Megan Garcia, has told the Senate that companies must be “legally accountable when they knowingly design harmful AI technologies that kill kids.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another lawsuit describes a 17-year-old whose chatbot encouraged self-harm and suggested that murdering his parents was reasonable for <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/12/10/nx-s1-5222574/kids-character-ai-lawsuit\">limiting screen time</a>. Character.AI banned minors last October, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/character-ai-is-killing-the-chatbot-experience-for-minors/\">it told TechCrunch</a>. The settlements will likely include monetary damages, though no liability was admitted in court filings made available Wednesday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Character.AI declined to comment, redirecting TechCrunch instead to the filings. Google has not responded to a request for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The company also teased a next-generation of its BlueCruise advanced driver assistance system that is both cheaper to make and more capable — ultimately leading to eyes-off driving in 2028.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wednesday’s announcement was one of the only ones to come from a major automaker at CES, marking a sharp turnaround from the late 2010s when they dominated the show. And it wasn’t made at a flashy keynote event; rather, Ford discussed the news at a speaker session called “Great Minds” that was meant to “explore the intersection of technology and humanity.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford says it digital assistant is hosted by Google Cloud and will be built using off-the-shelf LLMs, and the company is giving it deep access to vehicle-specific information. That means the assistant can answer high-level questions like “how many bags of mulch can my truck bed support?” But it also means owners will be able to ask for granular, real-time information like oil life. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is rolling the assistant out to its <a href=\"https://www.ford.com/support/category/ford-app/?srsltid=AfmBOopidMSYEhMEboUFbAYtkVT8RMBrMC3OW1Wf0fLVgvCZmyqYMGgM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">newly revamped Ford app</a> in early 2026. A native, in-vehicle integration will come in 2027, though the company wouldn’t specify which models it’s prioritizing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford didn’t go into great detail about what the in-car experience will look like, but it’s not hard to imagine the possibilities when looking at some of the more tech-forward automakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Just last month, Rivian showed off its own digital assistant sending and receiving text messages, handling complex navigation requests, and changing climate controls. Tesla has integrated Elon Musk’s chatbot Grok in its vehicles, which customers have used to generate on-the-spot sightseeing tours. Some of those capabilities may eclipse what Ford has in mind, but the automaker also has a full year to hammer out the in-car integration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new BlueCruise system teased on Wednesday is 30% cheaper to build than the current technology, according to Ford. It will debut in 2027 on the first EV to be built on the company’s low-cost “Universal Electric Vehicle” platform, which is expected to be a mid-sized pickup.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford is promising more with this next-generation BlueCruise system, including eyes-off driving in 2028. But it also claims the system will be capable of handling “point-to-point autonomy,” similar to what Tesla offers with its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software. Rivian has also teased a point-to-point system <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/rivian-rolls-out-new-universal-hands-free-driving-feature/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">coming later this year</a>.

He declined to specify the size of his team, noting only that the individuals he is considering include founders and investors “at the top of their game.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the themes Bonatsos intends to pursue include backing young founders, a trend he claims to have identified several years ago, before it became popular in the industry. Indeed, many of the leading founders of the AI wave are young and include college dropouts like Mercor’s founder, Brendan Foody.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bonatsos is also interested in investing in founders who are launching consumer businesses, a sector he views as “underappreciated” in a market saturated with enterprise-focused AI startups.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although General Catalyst has transitioned into what it calls an “<a href=\"https://www.generalcatalyst.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">investment and transformation company</a>,” it is continuing to make seed-stage bets.

However, after working with LinkedIn over the past two weeks — and addressing the social network’s concerns — Artisan is now being reinstated. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"> “Every startup inevitably has some kind of thing that comes back to bite them [from things] that they do early on,” Carmichael-Jack said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Contrary to what the rumors in the viral posts said, LinkedIn did not ban the company because its AI agents were spamming users. LinkedIn did, however, object to the startup using LinkedIn’s name on its website and also alleged that the company was using data brokers who had scraped the site without permission, Carmichael-Jack said. Data scraping is a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement#rights\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">violation of LinkedIn’s terms of service</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Artisan AI is a graduate of startup accelerator Y Combinator and became one of San Francisco’s buzziest startups via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its “Stop hiring humans” billboards posted</a> around town.

And I think it’s because, obviously, so many people were posting about it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a founder who likes a good guerrilla marketing scheme, he joked, “I wish we’d done it on purpose.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth was he was shocked to get an email from LinkedIn on Friday evening, December 19, right before the Christmas holiday. Carmichael-Jack described the team handling the ban as helpful and responsive, even if they were also anonymous and only reachable by email. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To appease LinkedIn, Artisan removed all mentions of LinkedIn from its website. It was using the name to compare some of its data features to LinkedIn’s. The CEO also got a crash course in third-party vendor verification, ensuring that his data partners were operating in compliance with LinkedIn’s policies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Carmichael-Jack is happy to be back on the Microsoft-owned social network, he downplayed how damaging being booted off would have been, saying very little of the data Artisan uses comes from the site. He’s also about to release a new version of the agent that is more autonomous and can use more channels for contacting prospects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We can work around anything. We’re launching dialing as a channel in a few months — outbound calling,” so if the LinkedIn ban could not have been reversed, “it wouldn’t be the end of the world,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Interestingly, LinkedIn isn’t a direct competitor. It did launch its first AI agent <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/ai/how-we-engineered-linkedins-hiring-assistant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last year called Hiring Assistant</a>, but it is focused on recruiting. Still, that LinkedIn went nuclear on Artisan could signal that a sales agent could one day be in its pipeline, too. LinkedIn did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In any case, Artisan’s very public banning can be seen as a warning for all agentic players looking for sources of data: Big Tech is watching. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Launched last August, the $2.99 per month streaming service offers ad-free access to library content, at a time when rival streamers are raising their prices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The opportunity for Howdy was — if you just look at what’s going on in the streaming world with streaming services, they’re getting more expensive. They keep raising prices, and they keep adding larger and larger ad loads,” Wood explained at the Variety Entertainment Summit at CES. “And so, the part of the market where it actually started — low-cost and no ads — is gone now. There’s no streaming services that address that portion of the market.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exec also suggested that Roku intends to bring Howdy to a broader market than just Roku customers, saying that while it started on Roku, the company “will take it off-platform as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Asked to clarify offstage if that meant mobile apps, the web, and elsewhere, Wood told TechCrunch the company has not yet said where, specifically, it plans to bring Howdy, but that “we want to distribute it everywhere.”  That seems to suggest that Howdy could be an app that you one day load on any device, large or small. Wood declined to share subscriber numbers with TechCrunch, but said onstage, “I think if I just look at the market, it’s going to be a big streaming service.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But the ChatGPT Health product silos these conversations away from your other chats. That way, the context of your health won’t come up in standard conversations with ChatGPT. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If people start chats about their health outside of the Health section, then the AI aims to nudge them to switch over.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Within Health, the AI might reference things you’ve discussed in its standard experience. If you ask ChatGPT for help constructing a marathon training plan, for example, then the AI would know you’re a runner when you talk in Health about your fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">ChatGPT Health will also be able to integrate with your personal information or medical records from wellness apps like Apple Health, Function, and MyFitnessPal. OpenAI notes that it will not use Health conversations to train its models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The CEO of Applications at OpenAI, Fidji Simo, wrote in <a href=\"https://fidjisimo.substack.com/p/chatgpt-health\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a blog post</a> that she sees ChatGPT Health as a response to existing issues in the healthcare space, like cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the healthcare system has its drawbacks, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/19/psa-you-shouldnt-upload-your-medical-images-to-ai-chatbots/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using AI chatbots for medical advice</a> creates a new slew of challenges. Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT operate by predicting the most likely response to prompts, not the most correct answer, since LLMs don’t have a concept of what is true or not. AI models are also prone to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/07/are-bad-incentives-to-blame-for-ai-hallucinations/\">hallucinations</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its own terms of service, OpenAI states that it is “not intended for use in the diagnosis or treatment of any health condition.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature is expected to roll out in the coming weeks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lux was a seed-stage investor in Anduril, which was last valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$30.5 billion</a>, and Applied Intuition, an autonomous vehicle startup that secured contracts with the Pentagon and was valued at <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/17/applied-intuition-raises-600-million-as-it-pushes-further-into-defense/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$15 billion</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lux has also made early bets on AI startups before the industry took off, post-ChatGPT. The firm’s early-stage AI investments include Hugging Face, Runway AI, and MosaicML, the latter of which was acquired by Databricks for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/databricks-picks-up-mosaicml-an-openai-competitor-for-1-3b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$1.3 billion</a> in 2023.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to being early to the defense tech and AI trends, Lux has realized significant exits from its investment in AI drug discovery company Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which went public in 2021, and the sale of Auris Health, a surgical robotics pioneer that sold to Johnson &amp; Johnson for up to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/13/jj-spends-3-4-billion-in-cash-for-auris-healths-lung-cancer-diagnostics-and-surgical-robots/\">$6 billion</a> in 2019.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The latest fundraise brings Lux’s assets under management to $7 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

And what better place to make a dark comedy than in that place that develops our society at this point?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show will also star Sarah Goldberg, Zach Galifianakis, Simon Helberg, and Rob Corddry and will take place in a fictional universe where no real company names are involved, nor will high-profile tech figures make cameos. However, the show may still hit some familiar chords. For instance, Helberg’s character is a maladjusted genius, working on an AI therapy app for teenagers, when he himself is something of a recluse, with a teenage daughter he neglects.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s loneliness, I think, at the heart of all the characters, and they’re all trying to connect, and they’re trying to connect through technology, which has some pitfalls,” Helberg says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two new clips from the shows were streamed at the event, but recording was not allowed. In one, an enthusiastic Magnussen pitches Galifianakis when encountering him eating at a restaurant. Galifianakis never responds but cuts him off eventually by stabbing him in the hand with his fork. Another clip showed Helberg completely missing an opportunity to relate to his daughter, and instead using her facial expression of annoyance to train his AI.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The show premieres Sunday, April 12 on AMC and AMC+. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Like its larger counterpart, the new digital calendar app and family organizer also lets you swap out the frame for different colors to better match your home’s decor.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The biggest selling point isn’t the digital screen itself, but the underlying software and AI capabilities. The primary feature — the calendar — is actually a mashup of all your family’s calendars from whatever services you use, whether that’s Google Calendar, iCal, Microsoft, or even your kids’ sports apps, like TeamSnap.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The calendar is color-coded to see everyone’s schedules at a glance, and can even import “calendars” that are really just emails with a few key dates or flyers sent home in Junior’s backpack. (The latter is an AI feature where you snap a photo of the paper, and the calendar updates with the new events.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080785\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/skylight-calendar-2.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sarah Perez</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also trying to address other pain points for families, such as managing grocery lists, reminders for appointments, meal planning, and recipe discovery. Of course, it can still display your family photos too, when otherwise not in use.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The app is well-designed to be easy to read with simple navigation, pops of color, and imagery that makes it possible for little kids to use.

Skylight’s helpful here too, as it can automatically create the shopping list of ingredients for you or even add it to your Instacart app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another clever AI feature lets you snap a photo of what’s in your fridge and get a recipe recommendation based on what you have on hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The need for such a system is clearly resonating with customers.

Now available in Google Classroom, teachers can use a new Gemini-powered tool that generates podcast-style audio lessons, meant to promote deeper comprehension of educational material. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To begin, educators simply go to the Gemini tab within Google Classroom. There, they can select different customization options, such as selecting the appropriate grade level, defining topics, and setting clear learning objectives. They can then further personalize the audio experience by choosing the number of speakers or selecting different conversational styles, such as interviews, roundtable discussions, or casual dialogues. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This new feature is currently available to users subscribed to Google Workspace Education Fundamentals, Standard, and Plus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By bringing this familiar format into the classroom, teachers can tap into their students’ interests. Research shows that students spend significant time listening to podcasts, with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.siriusxmmedia.com/insights/growing-up-with-podcasts-the-gen-z-podcast-listener-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">35 million </a>Gen Z monthly listeners in the U.S. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the popularity of podcasts as educational resources has grown rapidly; many universities now produce their own podcasts, and students increasingly seek out popular educational series on their own time. Podcast-style lessons might also encourage independent learning, since students can replay episodes whenever they need a refresher or missed a class.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, teachers are still grappling with integrating AI tools into their teaching practices. Many teachers express concerns about students’ increased reliance on generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, to complete assignments. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google urges teachers to practice responsible AI and carefully review and, if necessary, edit all AI-generated content to ensure accuracy and appropriateness for their specific classroom context and local policies. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini for Classroom first launched in 2024, and Google has continually added new features since then.

Dubbed “Cat AI,” the system was built using <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/introducing-nvidia-jetson-thor-the-ultimate-platform-for-physical-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nvidia’s Jetson Thor</a> physical AI platform, and is being demoed at CES on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brandon Hootman, vice president of data and AI at Caterpillar, told TechCrunch that Cat AI was built on a fleet of AI agents and can help answer a machine operator’s questions, allow them to access resources, offer safety tips, and schedule services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the biggest benefits of bringing this tech into these machines is the data that these systems collect and send back out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our customers don’t live in front of a laptop day in and day out; they live in the dirt,” Hootman said. “The ability to get the insights and take the action that they need while they’re doing the work is very important to them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Caterpillar is also piloting digital twins of construction sites using Nvidia’s Omniverse library of simulation resources to test scheduling scenarios and better calculate how much building material a project will need. Hootman said Caterpillar’s machines send roughly 2,000 messages back to the company every second. This data will help them build these simulations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company already has fully autonomous vehicles in the <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/en/news/caterpillarNews/2022/500-autonomous-trucks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">mining sector</a>, and Hootman said that these pilot programs are a great next step as the company looks to bring more automation to its portfolio.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The reason that we started here was it was a real challenge of our customers today that needed to be addressed, and also something that we had some real momentum on and we felt like we could bring to market pretty quickly,” Hootman said. “What we also liked is that it provided a kind of a technology foundation for us to then build upon.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Working with companies like Caterpillar — a legacy brand that doesn’t often intertwine with the tech industry — seems to fit right into Nvidia’s physical AI strategy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bill Dally, Nvidia’s chief scientist, told TechCrunch in 2025 that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/12/how-a-once-tiny-research-lab-helped-nvidia-become-a-4-trillion-dollar-company/\">the chipmaker considers physical AI to be the next frontier</a> for the company and its powerful GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">During its CES keynote on Monday, Nvidia laid out plans for its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-wants-to-be-the-android-of-generalist-robotics/\">full-stack ecosystem for physical AI</a>, which includes open AI models like the company’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/nvidia-unveils-new-cosmos-world-models-other-infra-for-physical-applications-of-ai/\">Cosmos model family</a>, simulation tools, and developer kits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While some may think physical AI is just for robotics companies, Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge AI at Nvidia, told TechCrunch the company takes a much broader definition as everyone is building robotics today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Physical AI is the next wave of AI,” Talla said. “Nvidia is pioneering that with computers that train the models, that do the simulation to test the models and deploy the models into the robots, whether [that’s] an autonomous car or a Caterpillar machine.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-for-the-first-official-day-with-ring-mobileye-siemens-robots-ai-and-more/\">CES coverage here</a>. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It’s a product that will make large installations simpler and cheaper while minimizing the footprint outside the home, and it’s key to the startup’s plans for expansion, which were <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/08/heat-pump-startup-quilt-raises-20m-series-b-to-expand-sales/\">recently turbocharged</a> by a $20 million Series B focused on expanding sales.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the real story is how <a href=\"https://www.quilt.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Quilt</a> developed the new product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since its founding, Quilt has prided itself on the amount of data it collects from its heat pumps. Not only are they internet-connected, they’re also laced with more sensors than typical heat pumps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By analyzing that data, Quilt engineers have been able to do things that other companies have not. In September, for example, they <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/12/how-an-over-the-air-update-made-quilts-heat-pumps-more-powerful/\">shipped an over-the-air update</a> to heat pumps in people’s homes that unlocked an additional 20% capacity, which could be directed toward either one or two zones. With the free update, people could be more comfortable during heat waves and cold snaps. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The team also used the data to develop the new three-zone unit and, in the process, solve a vexing challenge that many competitors face.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like all heat pumps, multi-zone units work best when they’re run at variable speed — that is, when heating or cooling demand is low, the compressor runs at a lower speed to deliver only the amount of heating or cooling that’s needed. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there are limits to how low they can operate. Compressors become less stable at low speeds, making them harder to control. Matthew Knoll, co-founder and CTO at Quilt, compares it to driving a car a low speeds. Maintaining an even 70 mph is easier than a steady 11 mph. “It’s a little harder,” he said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To compensate, most systems stop the compressor at a certain point, sacrificing some efficiency and comfort in the process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quilt, though, was able to draw on data collected from the thousand or so units already installed in people’s homes and businesses, giving them insights into how the systems were operating in the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way most systems are developed, they’re tested in a lab under a couple scenarios because testing’s expensive. And you end up with kind of a you know an average product,” Knoll said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have a thousand units out there in many different climates, and if we see something, we can look at it across a bunch of different units to understand if there’s room to optimize or if we’re seeing a problem in a corner case,” he said</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also uses a larger copper coil than many competitors, which allows it to spec a smaller compressor. That combination, along with some other tweaks to the design, allows Quilt to deliver nearly 90% of its rated capacity (27,000 BTUs) at -13˚ F (-25˚ C) without sacrificing low-demand performance or efficiency. Quilt says it’s the most efficient three-zone mini-split on the market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To save power, each indoor head can be controlled individually, supplying as little as 2,210 BTUs of heat or 1,570 BTUs of cooling. If heating or cooling isn’t needed, refrigerant still flows through the lines like it does in other heat pumps. But thanks to the outdoor unit’s low-speed performance, it only releases around 300 BTUs of heat in heating mode. That’s about as much heat as a grown adult throws off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Where does Quilt go from here? Knoll wouldn’t comment on future plans other than to say that Quilt “wants to be able to have a solution for all homes.” More products are coming, and it’s likely that reams of data will help lead their development.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For example, you could be “Anna’s Dad” in one group and “Goalkeeper” in another.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As for text stickers, you can turn any word into a sticker by typing your text into Sticker Search. You can also add these newly created stickers directly to your sticker packs without sending them in a chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Event reminders let you set custom reminders for your invitees when you create and send an event in a group chat.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These new features come as WhatsApp continues to bolster group chats with capabilities like sharing large files up to 2GB, sending HD media, screen sharing, voice chats, and more.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
