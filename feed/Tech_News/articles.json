State-of-the-art, or SOTA, is a term often used in the AI field that represents the industry’s best performance to date on a specific task.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have computational ways of assessing how good the designs are,” he told TechCrunch, adding that a high percentage of proteins the model creates will be viable when tested in the lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s foundational biology model, known as LatentX, enables academic institutions, biotech startups, and pharmaceutical companies to design novel proteins directly in their browser using natural language.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LatentX goes beyond what’s found in nature, creating entirely new molecule designs like nanobodies and antibodies with precise atomic structures. This approach can help develop new therapeutics at much faster rare.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to design entirely new proteins is what distinguishes LatentX from the AlphaFold, according to Kohl.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Alpha fold is a model for protein structure prediction. So it allows you to visualize existing structures, but it doesn’t, it doesn’t let you generate new proteins,” he said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In contrast to AI-driven drug discovery companies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/24/xaira-an-ai-drug-discovery-startup-launches-with-a-massive-1b-says-its-ready-to-start-developing-drugs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Xaira</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/29/ai-enabled-drug-discovery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Recursion</a> or DeepMind spinout <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/31/alphabets-ai-drug-discovery-platform-isomorphic-labs-raises-600m-from-thrive/\">Isomorphic Labs</a>, which focus on developing proprietary medicines, Latent Labs’ business model involves licensing its model for use by external organizations. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Not every company is in a position to build their own AI models, to have their own AI infrastructure, and to have their own AI teams,” Kohl said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While LatentX is available for free, Kohl said the company intends to eventually charge for advanced features and capabilities as they’re introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other companies providing open-sourced AI foundational models for drug discovery include Chai Discovery and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/25/evolutionaryscale-backed-by-amazon-and-nvidia-raises-142m-for-protein-generating-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">EvolutionaryScale</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Latent Labs is backed by Radical Ventures, Sofinnova Partners, Google’s Chief Scientist Jeff Dean, Anthropic’s CEO Dario Amodei and Eleven Labs CEO Mati Staniszewski.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Meta’s interest in acquiring AI chipmakers like FuriosaAI reflects its broader strategy to reduce its reliance on third-party suppliers, such as Nvidia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why the deal with Meta fell through, CEO of FuriosaAI June Paik told TechCrunch: “We want to continue our mission, and I think it’s an exciting opportunity at the same time. I believe it’s a very impactful contribution, both personally and for the company, to make AI computing more sustainable.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With M&amp;A (at least from Meta) off the table, Paik declined to specify if the startup is now in pursuit of fresh funding. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3029827\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png 1999w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=150,96 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=300,192 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=768,491 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=680,434 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1200,767 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1280,818 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=430,275 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=720,460 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=900,575 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=800,511 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=1536,981 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=668,427 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=587,375 587w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=966,617 966w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=708,452 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/server_fc7b15.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Paik says this new partnership will lead to business possibilities far beyond South Korea. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“LG AI’s EXAONE is regarded as the leading sovereign AI model in South Korea. It won’t be used just within LG. It will be one of the main AI models used in the Korean AI ecosystem. We expect there will be many demands for this EXAONE, as well as for our chip solutions in South Korea, but not only in Korea. The LG team is also partnering with and doing business with global customers. So, we also expect this to be used by those customers, including global customers,” Paik said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">LG AI’s decision to adopt Furiosa’s AI chip and accelerator is notable for another reason: it’s one of the few public endorsements of a rival to Nvidia by a major enterprise, Paik said. One major reason for the win is that the startup’s hardware costs less. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We had to prove that our solution not only delivers strong performance but also lowers total cost of ownership,” Paik said.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">FuriosaAI claims that its RNGD accelerator outperformed competitive GPUs with LG AI Research’s EXAONE models, delivering 2.25 times better inference performance. Paik also says that LG found the FuriosaAI hardware was more energy efficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Furiosa’s chip is not a general GPU but was built exclusively for AI. “We can support a wide variety of AI models efficiently. But unlike GPUs, which are still fundamentally general-purpose processors, our architecture is natively built for AI computing. We do not develop our chip for rendering or mining,” Paik said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Seoul-based startup, which also operates an office in Santa Clara, has a global team of just 15 employees.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

AI companies are competing fiercely for the public perception of being ahead in the AI race: an intangible battle of “vibes” that can have big implications for securing top AI talent. A lot of AI researchers come from backgrounds in competitive math, so benchmarks like IMO mean more than others.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last year, <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/ai-solves-imo-problems-at-silver-medal-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google scored a silver medal at IMO</a> using a “formal” system, meaning it required humans to translate problems into a machine‑readable format. This year, both OpenAI and Google entered “informal” systems into the competition, which were able to ingest questions and generate proof‑based answers in natural language. Both companies claim their AI models correctly answered five out of six questions on IMO’s test, scoring higher than most high school students and Google’s AI model from last year, without requiring any human-machine translation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In interviews with TechCrunch, researchers behind OpenAI and Google’s IMO efforts claimed that these gold-medal performances represent breakthroughs around AI reasoning models in non-verifiable domains. While AI reasoning models tend to do well on questions with straightforward answers, such as simple math or coding tasks, these systems struggle on tasks with more ambiguous solutions, such as buying a great chair or helping with complex research.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, Google is raising questions around how OpenAI conducted and announced its gold-medal IMO performance. After all, if you’re going to enter AI models into a math contest for high schoolers, you might as well argue like teenagers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Shortly after OpenAI announced its feat on Saturday morning, <a href=\"https://x.com/demishassabis/status/1947337618787615175\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google DeepMind’s CEO </a>and researchers took to social media to <a href=\"https://x.com/lmthang/status/1946960256439058844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">slam OpenAI for announcing its gold medal prematurely </a>— shortly after IMO announced which high schoolers had won the competition on Friday night — and for not having their model’s test officially evaluated by IMO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Thang Luong, a Google DeepMind senior researcher and lead for the IMO project, told TechCrunch that Google waited to announce its IMO results to respect the students participating in the competition.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luong said that Google has been working with IMO’s organizers since last year in preparation for the test and wanted to have the IMO president’s blessing and official grading before <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/advanced-version-of-gemini-with-deep-think-officially-achieves-gold-medal-standard-at-the-international-mathematical-olympiad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announcing its official results, which it did on Monday morning</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The IMO organizers have their grading guideline,” Luong said. “So any evaluation that’s not based on that guideline could not make any claim about gold-medal level [performance].”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Noam Brown, a senior OpenAI researcher who worked on the IMO model, told TechCrunch that IMO reached out to OpenAI a few months ago about participating in a formal math competition, but the ChatGPT-maker declined because it was working on natural language systems that it thought were more worth pursuing. Brown says OpenAI didn’t know IMO was conducting an informal test with Google.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">OpenAI says it hired third-party evaluators — three former IMO medalists who understood the grading system — to grade its AI model’s performance. After OpenAI learned of its gold-medal score, Brown said the company reached out to IMO, which then told the company to wait to announce until after IMO’s Friday night award ceremony.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">IMO did not respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google isn’t necessarily wrong here — it did go through a more official, rigorous process to achieve its gold-medal score — but the debate may miss the bigger picture: AI models from several leading AI labs are improving quickly. Countries from around the world sent their brightest students to compete at IMO this year, and just a few percent of them scored as well as OpenAI and Google’s AI models did.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While OpenAI used to have a significant lead over the industry, it certainly feels as though the race is more closely matched than any company would like to admit. OpenAI is expected to release GPT-5 in the coming months, and the company certainly hopes to give off the impression that it still leads the AI industry.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

If the agency moves to modify the order or vacate it entirely, it would pave the way for a surveillance vendor with a history of data breaches to legally operate again unimpeded.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite the ban taking effect in 2021, Zuckerman was caught involved in another spyware operation less than a year later. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2022, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/17/support-king-ftc-spytrac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TechCrunch received a cache of breached data</a> from the servers of a phone spyware app called SpyTrac, which revealed it was being run by a group of freelance developers with direct ties to Support King, likely to skirt the FTC’s ban. The breached data also contained records from SpyFone, despite the FTC’s order requiring the company to delete the data it illegally obtained from victims’ phones. SpyTrac went offline soon after we contacted Zuckerman for comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zuckerman’s petition is already facing criticism from the security community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think this petition should be opposed loudly and vigorously. Mr. Zuckerman has repeatedly shown himself to be a bad actor, flouting the FTC by continuing to run his stalkerware company even after the ban was issued,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There is no doubt that both the ban and the continued reporting requirements are personally burdensome to him, but I would argue that that is the point,” said Galperin. “I have no doubt that Mr. Zuckerman would start up another stalkerware company the minute he thought he could get away with it.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how the FTC will vote on Zuckerman’s petition, nor did the agency set a date.

About 330 million of those are coming from users in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These numbers show just how ubiquitous OpenAI’s flagship product is becoming.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google’s parent company, Alphabet, does not release daily search data, but recently revealed that Google receives 5 trillion queries per year, which averages to just under 14 billion daily searches. Independent researchers have found similar trends.

While it’s still too early to draw definitive conclusions, it appears that the hackers who first started abusing this flaw were targeting government organizations, according to Silas Cutler, the principal researcher at Censys, a cybersecurity firm that monitors hacking activities on the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It looks like initial exploitation was against a narrow set of targets,” Cutler told TechCrunch. “Likely government related.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a fairly rapidly evolving case. Initial exploitation of this vulnerability was likely fairly limited in terms of targeting, but as more attackers learn to replicate exploitation, we will likely see breaches as a result of this incident,” said Cutler.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about these SharePoint attacks?

Eye Security, which first <a href=\"https://research.eye.security/sharepoint-under-siege/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">published the existence of the bug</a>, reported seeing a similar number, saying its researchers scanned more than 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and found evidence of dozens of compromised servers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the limited number of targets and the types of targets at the beginning of the campaign, Cutler explained, it is likely that the hackers were part of a government group, commonly known as an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#advanced-persistent-threat-apt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">advanced persistent threat</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/07/20/microsoft-sharepoint-hack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Washington Post reported</a> on Sunday that the attacks targeted U.S. federal and state agencies, as well as universities and energy companies, among other commercial targets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Microsoft <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/customer-guidance-for-sharepoint-vulnerability-cve-2025-53770/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">said in a blog post</a> that the vulnerability only affects versions of SharePoint that are installed on local networks, and not the cloud versions, which means that each organization that deploys a SharePoint server needs to apply the patch or disconnect it from the internet.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Among those who engaged with these companions regularly, 13% chat with them daily and 21% chat a few times a week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boys (31%) were also slightly more likely than girls (25%) to say they had never used an AI companion, among the one in four teens who said they have never tried it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The findings are based on a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/talk-trust-and-trade-offs-how-and-why-teens-use-ai-companions\">study</a> that ran during April and May 2025 and used a representative sample of 1,060 teens and was conducted by researchers from NORC at the University of Chicago.

The company plans to offer about 12.5 million shares. Yet existing shareholders will be allowed to cash out of nearly 24.7 million shares, <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/ipo-roadshow-launch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">it said.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, should this IPO be as hot as everyone thinks it will be, existing shareholders will get the option to sell, collectively, up to 5.5 million more shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma founder CEO Dylan Field has disclosed that he plans to sell 2.35 million shares. At the midrange he’ll be cashing out of over $62 million. (That might be a much higher number if the IPO prices above $28, too.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even with that sale, he will still own an enormous number of shares and control the company. He will hold 74% of the voting rights after the IPO. This is thanks to supervoting rights of 15 votes per share for the Class B stock he controls, plus the right to vote the Class B shares of his co-founder, Evan Wallace, the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1579878/000162828025035381/figma-sx1a.htm#i8dccdb6f4d824d4aba81e7c665eaa62d_148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">company says in its S-1</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Figma’s biggest venture investors are all cashing out some shares, as well, including Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia. Should the demand be there for the over-allotment, they will cash out 1.7 million to 3.3 million shares apiece. That should allow them to return some cash to their investors in this liquidity-starved venture market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It should be noted, though, that each of these investors is keeping the lion’s share of their Figma holdings. One way to interpret this largely secondary sale is that if the company hadn’t opened up share sales to existing investors, it might not have had enough shares to meet the demand.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As you might expect, the company will not make money from the shares its stockholders sell. But should it price above its announced range (as often happens with hot IPOs), Figma will raise more, as will its shareholders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prior to pricing, IPO experts expected Figma to sell around $1.5 billion worth of stock. Should it price above range and exceed that, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/01/figma-moves-closer-to-a-blockbuster-ipo-that-could-raise-1-5b/\">Figma would be the biggest IPO</a> of 2025 to date.

Previously, iOS users had to completely sign out of a Google account and then log in with another, and repeat this process every time they wanted to access a different account.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of us use our mobile devices for both work and personal tasks, often juggling multiple Google Accounts,” <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/chrome-enterprise/chrome-brings-personal-and-work-separation-to-ios-users-and-more-enterprise-protections-to-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google wrote in a blog post.</a> “This can mean constantly signing in and out. Chrome is now offering support for managed account browsing that creates strict data separation from other browsing and seamless switching between accounts.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When users sign in or switch to their work Google account in Chrome, browsing related to their organization will be kept separate from their other browsing on the device. Local data and content, including tabs, history, and passwords, stay only within the managed account browsing experience. Google says this is ideal for both end users and IT admins.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The update comes as Google says many organizations are moving away from company phones, which means employees often have to access company resources from their personal phones and computers. Google says the improved account switching experience and data separation “better enables businesses to allow employees to use their device of choice.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3029522\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png 2148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=768,405 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1200,632 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1280,675 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=720,379 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=900,474 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=800,422 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1536,809 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=2048,1079 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=1171,617 1171w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=708,373 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-21-at-12.17.02PM.png?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The first time users sign in or switch to a managed account, they will see an onboarding screen that explains the separation of managed account browsing and how their organization is handling their data. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Organizations maintain control and can decide how existing browsing data is handled when a user initially signs in or switches to a managed account.

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My whole life has been preparing me for this moment,” Ben Sanders said when asked about why he launched his emergency response startup Hyper. The company announced Monday a $6.3 million seed round led by Eniac Ventures, as well as an official emergence from stealth. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As a child, he so wanted to become a police officer that he had his mother sew yellow stripes on his navy sweatpants. He wore that with an officer’s rain hat for an entire year. As he grew up, he worked at the intersection of tech and government and once ran for federal office. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Around a year ago, he read a news article about how his hometown was looking to use AI to reduce the wait time for emergency services. Sanders, who once launched an AI voice for drive-through restaurants, suddenly had an idea. Though he didn’t think AI was quite ready to help with 911 calls, he felt this was a space for innovation, especially after realizing that most calls made to the emergency line are not considered emergency calls at all. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders teamed up with his friend Damian McCabe. The duo officially launched Hyper on Monday, offering an AI voice company that can handle some 911 calls. Sanders, who is CEO, said the product is to deal with the non-emergency calls that take time away from those critical calls that determine the “difference between life and death.” McCabe is the company’s CPO. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Right now, even if a person looked to call their local police department, they would most often find a 10-digit number that routes them to the same people who take 911 calls. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Imagine getting stuck talking to someone for eight minutes about a neighbor’s dog barking, only to answer the next call late, because of that noise complaint, and hear the trembling voice of a 5-year-old whose dad has just collapsed on the floor,” Sanders said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyper answers questions, texts links, forwards calls, and even takes non-emergency police reports. “Hyper always plays it safe, so if any calls fall outside the approved scope, or if one sounds slightly more emergency, we can automatically escalate those to a human expert just in case.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders described the fundraising process as “frenetic, manic, and fast.” It took him less than two months to raise the whole round, which was ultimately oversubscribed and included follow-on capital. Ripple Ventures, GreatPoint Ventures, VSC Ventures, Tusk Venture Partners, and K5 Global also participated in the round. Sanders said he met his connection at Eniac Ventures through a mutual acquaintance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyper hopes to use the fresh capital to help scale across the country, integrate more into existing 911 systems, hire a head of engineering, and build its next product. There is some competition in this space, like Aurelian, which also sorts non-emergency calls. Sanders said what makes Hyper different from the rest is its focus on 911. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We train our models on real 911 calls with local agencies,” he said. “We support more languages. And we’ve already gone live with many centers, which is a big operational hurdle in government and public safety.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sanders hopes that Hyper can take away at least some of the stress associated with being a 911 caller, in a way that perhaps even brings more people to the profession. Right now, he says, most call centers are understaffed and struggling to hire. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s such a tough job, I don’t even know if I could do it,” Sanders said. “But I know how to build technology that can help; to help call-takers and dispatchers who are the unsung heroes; to help reduce their burden by tackling the non-emergency calls and noise, and in doing so, ultimately help save lives.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The app includes features for organizing text clips, support for shortcuts to trigger text snippets, duplicate prevention, and code formatting, among other things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Its goal is to offer users more control and customization compared with the traditional clipboard, making it a more productive alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quip is nonintrusive — on Mac, it lives on the menu bar and on iOS, it has a special keyboard — and maintains a history of all things that you copy across devices as a universal clipboard.

You can filter through these items by text, links, images, code, files, and recency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Quip allows you to add clipboard items to collections to easily access them later.

And while many of the startups garnering large valuations are focused on hardware and weaponry — think <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/05/anduril-raises-2-5b-at-30-5b-valuation-led-by-founders-fund/\">Anduril</a>, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/06/shield-ai-raises-240-million-at-a-5-3-billion-valuation-to-commercialize-its-ai-drone-tech/\">Shield AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/15/drone-manufacturer-skydio-raises-170-million-extension-round/\">Skydio</a> — <a href=\"https://www.runetech.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Rune Technologies</a> wants to tackle AI-enabled software for military logistics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The U.S. military runs on Excel spreadsheets and whiteboards and manual processes right now to execute logistics operations,” co-founder David Tuttle told TechCrunch. “Logistics is never the sexiest part of the military. The technology industry emphasis is on how do we make things go boom? How do we build great weapons systems?”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Logistics, Tuttle says, usually falls behind when it comes to innovation. And he should know. Earlier in his career, he was a field artillery officer in the U.S. Army. Later, he served with the Joint Special Operations Command before going on to work at Anduril, where he met his co-founder, ex-Meta software engineer Peter Goldsborough. The two founded Rune after seeing how much modern warfare has changed the scale and pace at which armies have to sustain force.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ukraine is a sad example of the expenditures of munitions, the consumption of supplies, and those types of things in a near-peer adversary conflict — they will break human-centric and analog-centric processes,” said Tuttle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rune’s flagship product TyrOS promises to transform manual logistics processes into intelligent supply webs that predict future needs, optimize current resources, and enable distributed operations — even from a disconnected laptop in the middle of the jungle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has just raised a $24 million Series A round off the back of pilot deployments under the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps. The round — which Human Capital led with participation from Pax VC, Washington Harbour Partners, a16z, Point72 Ventures, XYZ Venture Capital, and Forward Deployed VC — will go toward expanding TyrOS deployment into other U.S. military services. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TyrOS has two major selling points. The first is its technical capabilities as a mission command system for logistics. TyrOS relies on deep learning models, including time series models, to forecast supply and demand assets like personnel, transportation, equipment, food, and other resources based on hundreds of environmental and supply variables.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A logistician thinks about not just, ‘What do I have on hand from supplies?’ but also, ‘What vehicles do I have to move that?’” said Tuttle. “’What qualified crews do I have to drive that vehicle?’ ‘What routes is that vehicle going to go over?’ ‘And is that threat-informed?’ ‘Is a bridge blown up on the route that we need to reroute around?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tuttle says the team at Rune, two-thirds of which are veterans, is also working to integrate generative AI into TyrOS for “course of action generation,” enabling the system to digest massive datasets in real-time battle space environments so that logisticians and commanders can query it on the fly. And while LLMs have advanced rapidly, TyrOS still relies on traditional mathematical optimization for certain tasks — like planning aircraft loads based on cubic volume and other constraints — where precise calculations are essential. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TyrOS’s second major hook is its edge-first architecture that bypasses the need for constant connectivity to remote servers, allowing the system to operate independently and synchronize when communications are reestablished. In other words, TyrOS is “cloud-capable, but not cloud-required.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Building software today from a cloud environment standpoint is very different architecturally than if I’m building software to run literally on this laptop in the jungle in the Philippines with Marines or soldiers,” Tuttle said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TyrOS is also cloud- and hardware-agnostic; it can run on program-of-record hardware server stacks that the military uses today for ease of integration, per Tuttle. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The co-founder noted that Rune’s backers include executives at both Palantir and Anduril, where he sees plenty of partnership opportunities. Rune was recently selected for the Palantir Startup Fellowship and announced its integration earlier this year with Palantir’s Defense OSDK (Ontology Software Development Kit) to enable automated logistics, from the tactical edge to the strategic layer. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automating the gap between tactical-level intelligence and strategic decision-making is Rune’s long-term vision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’m not just worried about sustaining this for the next 30 or 60 days,” Tuttle said. “I’m worried about how this might impact production decisions back in the defense industrial base. That’s the vision we want to get up to. How do you drive tactical level data all the way up to the operational level, to the strategic level, to potentially drive the production of artillery shells?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Clarification: Peter Goldsborough volunteers under the U.S. Marine Corps Cyber Auxiliary.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Got a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

The crypto exchange also noted that it is working with India’s Computer Emergency Response Team, CERT-In, and partner exchanges to investigate the matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Indian crypto exchange, registered with the government’s Financial Intelligence Unit, boasts over 16 million users and offers access to more than 500 crypto assets.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The incident was quickly contained by isolating the affected operational account,” said Gupta in an X post. “Since our operational accounts are segregated from customer wallets, the exposure is only limited to this specific account and is being fully absorbed by us — from our own treasury reserves.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 27-29, 2025</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gupta noted that the company was working with the exchange partner to block and recover assets. “I understand incidents like this can be unsettling — even when customer assets are unaffected,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The exchange also <a href=\"https://x.com/smtgpt/status/1947215040899158359\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched a “recovery bounty” program</a> on Monday to award up to 25% of any recovered funds to anyone who can help trace and retrieve the stolen crypto.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More than recovering the stolen funds, what is important for us is to identify and catch the attackers, because such things shouldn’t happen again, not with us, not with anyone in the industry,” said Gupta.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the breach comes <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/18/indias-wazirx-confirms-security-breach-after-230-million-suspicious-transfer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">almost exactly a year since the massive breach at Indian crypto exchange giant WazirX</a>, which resulted in the loss of $230 million — nearly half its reserves. The exchange halted trading after the loss. It remains unclear, however, whether there are any connections between the two incidents.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
