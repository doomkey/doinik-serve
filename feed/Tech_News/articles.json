It had lost Aptiv as one of its financial backers, prompting Hyundai to step up with another <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/hyundai-is-spending-close-to-1-billion-to-keep-self-driving-startup-motional-alive/\">$1 billion investment</a> to keep it going. Several layoffs, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/14/motional-cut-about-550-employees-around-40-in-recent-restructuring-sources-say/\">40% restructuring cut</a> in May 2024, had whittled the company from its peak of about 1,400 employees to less than 600. Meanwhile, advancements in AI were changing how engineers were developing the technology. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional was going to have to evolve or die. It <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/07/motional-delays-commercial-robotaxi-plans-amid-restructuring/\">paused everything</a> and picked option No. 1.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional told TechCrunch it has rebooted its robotaxi plans with an AI-first approach to its self-driving system and a promise to launch a commercial driverless service in Las Vegas by the end of 2026. The company has already opened up a robotaxi service — with a human safety operator behind the wheel — to its employees. It plans to offer that service to the public with an unnamed ride-hailing partner later this year. (Motional has existing relationships with Lyft and Uber.) By the end of the year, the human safety operator will be pulled from the robotaxis and a true commercial driverless service will begin, the company said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We saw that there was tremendous potential with all the advancements that were happening within AI; and we also saw that while we had a safe, driverless system, there was a gap to getting to an affordable solution that could generalize and scale globally,” Motional president and CEO Laura Major said during a presentation at the company’s Las Vegas facilities. “And so we made the very hard decision to pause our commercial activities, to slow down in the near term so that we could speed up.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081790\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Motional-Hyundai-Vegas-facility.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This meant shifting away from its classic robotics approach to an AI foundation model-based one. Motional was never devoid of AI. Motional’s self-driving system used individual machine learning models to handle perception, tracking, and semantic reasoning. But it also used more rules-based programs for other operations within the software stack. And the individual ML models made it a complex web of software, Major said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, AI models originally built for language began to be applied in robots and other physical AI systems, including the development of autonomous driving. That transformer architecture made it possible to build large and complex AI models, ultimately leading to the emergence, and skyrocketing use, of ChatGPT. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional searched for ways to combine these smaller models and integrate them into a single backbone, allowing for an end-to-end architecture. It has also maintained the smaller models for developers, which Major explained gives Motional the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is really critical for two things; One is for generalizing more easily to new cities, new environments, new scenarios,” she said. “And the other is to do this in a cost optimized way. So for example, the traffic lights might be different in the next city you go to, but you don’t have to redevelop or re-analyze those. You just collect some data, train the model, and it’s capable of operating safely in that new city.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch got a first-hand look at Motional’s new approach during a 30-minute autonomous drive around Las Vegas. One demo can’t provide an accurate assessment of a self-driving system. It can, however, pinpoint weaknesses and differences from previous iterations, and gauge progress. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Progress is what I saw as the Hyundai Ioniq 5 I rode in autonomously navigated its way off Las Vegas Boulevard and into the pickup and drop-off area of the Aria Hotel. These bustling areas are notorious in La Vegas and my experience was no different as the autonomous vehicle slowly nudged its way around a stopped taxi and unloading passengers, changed lanes, then back again, passing dozens of people, giant flower pots, and cars along the way. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Motional previously operated a ride-hailing service in Las Vegas with partner Lyft using vehicles that would autonomously handle portions of a ride. Parking lots and hotel valet and app ride pickup areas were never part of those operations. A human safety operator, always behind the wheel, would take over to navigate parking lots or the busy pickup and drop-off points of hotel lobbies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is still more progress to be made. The graphics displayed to riders within the vehicle are still under development. And while there was never a disengagement during my demo ride — which means the human safety operator takes over — the vehicle did take its time to nudge itself around a double parked Amazon delivery van. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Major argues Motional is on the right path to deploy safely and cost effectively. And its majority owner Hyundai is in it for the long haul, she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think the real long-term vision, you know, for all of this, is putting Level 4 on people’s personal cars,” Major said, referring to a term that mean the system handles all driving with no expectation of human intervention. “Robotaxis, that’s stop number one, and huge impact. But ultimately, I think any OEM would love to also integrate that into their cars.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

In several cases, the top result was actually the Guardian article about the removal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Google spokesperson told the Guardian that the company does not “comment on individual removals within Search,” but that it works to “make broad improvements.” The spokesperson also said that an internal team of clinicians reviewed the queries highlighted by the Guardian and found “in many instances, the information was not inaccurate and was also supported by high quality websites.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Google for additional comment.

Old plants are being refurbished, and investors are showering startups with cash. In the last several weeks of 2025 alone, nuclear startups <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/17/radiant-nuclear-raises-300m-for-its-semi-sized-1-mw-reactor/\">raised $1.1 billion</a>, largely on <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/26/here-are-the-nuclear-fission-startups-backed-by-big-tech/\">investor optimism</a> that smaller nuclear reactors will succeed where the broader industry has recently stumbled.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Traditional nuclear reactors are massive pieces of infrastructure. The newest reactors built in the U.S. — Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia —  contain tens of thousands of tons of concrete, are powered by fuel assemblies 14 feet tall, and generate over 1 gigawatt of electricity each. But they were also eight years late and more than $20 billion over budget.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fresh crop of nuclear startups hopes that by shrinking the reactor, they’ll be able to sidestep both problems. Need more power? Just add more reactors. Smaller reactors, they argue, can be built using mass production techniques, and as companies produce more parts, they should get better at making them, which should drive down costs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The magnitude of that benefit is something experts are <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004224028712#sec2\">still researching</a>, but today’s nuclear startups are depending on it being greater than zero.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But manufacturing isn’t easy. Just look at Tesla’s experience: The company struggled mightily to profitably produce the Model 3 in large numbers — and it had the benefit of being in the automotive industry, where the U.S. still has significant expertise. U.S. nuclear startups don’t have that advantage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I have a number of friends who work in supply chain for nuclear, and they can rattle off like five to ten materials that we just don’t make in the United States,” <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/milowerner/\">Milo Werner</a>, general partner at DCVC, told TechCrunch. “We have to buy them overseas. We’ve forgotten how to make them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Werner knows a thing or two about manufacturing. Before becoming an investor, she worked at Tesla leading new product introduction, and before that, she did the same at FitBit, launching four factories in China for the wearables company. Today, in addition to investing at DCVC, Werner has co-founded the NextGen Industry Group, which works to advance the adoption of new technologies in the manufacturing sector.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When companies of any size want to manufacture something, they face two main challenges, Werner said. One is capital, which is often the biggest constraint since factories aren’t cheap. Fortunately for the nuclear industry, that shouldn’t pose much of a problem. “They’re awash in capital right now,” she said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the nuclear industry isn’t immune from the other challenge all manufacturers face, which is a lack of human capital. “We haven’t really built any industrial facilities in 40 years in the United States,” Werner said. As a result, we’ve lost the muscle memory. “It’s like we’ve been sitting on the couch watching TV for 10 years and then getting up and trying to run a marathon the next day. It’s not good.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After decades of offshoring, the U.S. lacks people experienced with both factory construction and operations. “There are for sure some people in the United States who have been doing this, but we don’t have the quantum of people that we need for everybody to have a full staff of seasoned manufacturing people.” She not just talking about machine operators, but everyone from factory floor supervisors all the way up to CFOs and board members.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The good news is that Werner sees a lot of startups, nuclear and otherwise, building early versions of their products in close proximity to their technical team. “That is pulling manufacturing in closer to the United States because it allows them to have that cycle of improvement.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To reap the benefits of mass manufacturing, it’s helpful for startups of all stripes to start small and scale up. “Really leaning into modularity is very important for investors,” she said. The modular approach helps companies start producing small volumes early on so they can collect data on the manufacturing process. Ideally, that data will show improvement over time, which can put investors at ease. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The benefits of mass manufacturing don’t happen overnight. Companies will often forecast cost reductions that can result from learning through manufacturing, but it might take longer than they expect. “Often it takes years, like a decade, to get there,” Werner said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wing, the Alphabet-owned company that delivers groceries, over-the-counter medicine, and hot lattes, is expanding its partnership with Walmart for the second time in less than a year. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The two companies announced on Sunday plans to bring the on-demand drone delivery service to an additional 150 Walmart stores. The rollout, which builds off existing services at stores in Dallas-Fort Worth and Atlanta, will occur throughout this year and into 2027, Wing’s new chief business officer Heather Rivera told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The expansion suggests customers are using Wing’s drone delivery service enough to warrant growth. Rivera said its top 25% customers are using the service three times a week. Some of the most commonly ordered items are eggs, ground beef, fresh tomatoes, avocados, limes, lunchables, and snacks such as Takis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 150-store expansion announcement follows plans shared in June 2025 to launch in Houston, Orlando, Tampa, and Charlotte. Rivera said Wing will launch in Houston on January 15. Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from more than 270 Walmart stores, including Los Angeles, St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Miami and serve about 10% of the U.S. population.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The announcement places the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/14/one-size-doesnt-fit-all-for-wings-drone-deliveries/\">former Google X project</a> firmly in the commercial enterprise category. And while Wing does have a partnership with DoorDash, its primary path to commercial operations has been, and still is, through Walmart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies first partnered in 2023, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/24/walmart-is-adding-wing-drone-deliveries-to-limited-superstores-this-year/\">launching a pilot program </a>to test on-demand drone delivery at two stores in the Dallas metro area that reached about 60,000 homes. The program later grew to 18 Walmart Supercenters in Dallas-Fort Worth and more recently spread to stores in Atlanta.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wing will continue to evolve its technology and operations, according to Rivera; the company recently completed the first commercial flights for its larger aircraft that can carry a five-pound payload, for instance. But in general, she said Wing is focused on co-locating its service at Walmart sites and integrating into their operations.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivera said Wing will likely try a couple of different approaches to scaling its operations like clustering store openings. It’s an approach Wing used last year when it launched six stores together in Atlanta. Rivera would not share if its operations are profitable or when they might be. But Rivera did note she was brought in to scale the business. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“And so that is what I’m here to do, and excited about,” she said, later noting that “volume is definitely powering our flywheel.” In other words, scaling to as many stores in as many markets as possible is critical for its business economics. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The core idea is that the standard could facilitate these various parts of the process instead of requiring connections with different agents.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google said that it also works with other agentic protocols, such as Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) — <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/16/google-launches-new-protocol-for-agent-driven-purchases/\">which Google announced last year</a> — Agent2Agent (A2A), and Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Users will be able to pay using Google Pay and pass on the shipping information saved in the Google Wallet. Google said that it will soon support PayPal as a payment option.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is one of the really exciting parts about agentic,” said Shopify CEO and founder Tobi Lutke. “It’s really good at finding people who have specific interests and finding the product that is just perfect for them. Like, I would have never searched for this product, but somehow it found me right on the other side. This kind of serendipity is where the best of commerce happens.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, Shopify also unveiled a similar integration with Microsoft Copilot for shopping today to let customers check out easily within the conversational flow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In another consumer-facing change, Google said it will now allow brands to offer a special discount to users while they are looking for a product recommendation when using the AI mode. For instance, if you are searching for a rug using a query like “I’m looking for a modern, stylish rug for a high-traffic dining room. I host a lot of dinner parties, so I want something that is easy to clean,” brands can set up their campaign in a way to offer you a discount at that moment. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?w=443\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081722\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png 2440w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=98,150 98w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=195,300 195w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=768,1180 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=443,680 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=781,1200 781w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=833,1280 833w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=280,430 280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=469,720 469w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=586,900 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=521,800 521w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=1000,1536 1000w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=1333,2048 1333w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=435,668 435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=244,375 244w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=402,617 402w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=346,531 346w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Direct_Offers_Still.png?resize=33,50 33w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is also giving users new data attributes within the Merchant Center to have sellers feature their items better within AI search surfaces.

If they don’t always give a totally accurate representation of where commercial deployment is at the moment, they do give visitors a peek at where it might be headed. And, of course, they sure are fun to look at. I spent a decent amount of time perusing the bots on display this week. Here are some of the most memorable ones I encountered.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The ping pong player </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The movie <em>Marty Supreme</em> just came out a month ago, so I guess it’s only appropriate that there was a ping-pong-playing robot at this year’s convention. The Chinese <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ai-robotmaker-sharpa-reaches-key-milestone-with-mass-production-of-worlds-most-advanced-human-sized-robotic-hand-302643434.html\">robotics firm Sharpa</a> had rigged up a full-bodied bot to play some competitive table tennis against one of the firm’s staff. When I stopped by the Sharpa booth, the robot was losing to its human competitor, 5-9, and I would not characterize the game that was occurring as particularly fast-paced. Still, the spectacle of seeing a robot play ping pong was impressive enough on its own, and I’m sure I have known some humans whose paddle skills were basically equivalent to (or slightly worse than) the bot’s. A Sharpa rep told me that the company’s main product is its robotic hand, and that the full-bodied bot had been debuted at CES to demonstrate the hand’s dexterity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The boxer </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the exhibits that drew the largest crowds involved robots from the Chinese company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/engineai-t800-humanoid/\">EngineAI</a>, which is developing humanoid robots. The bots, dubbed the T800 (a nod to the Terminator franchise), were in a mock boxing ring and were styled as fighting machines. That said, I never saw any of the bots actually hit each other. Instead, they would sort of shadowbox <em>near</em> each other, never actually making contact. They were also a little unpredictable. One kept walking out of the ring and into the audience, which naturally got a rise out of onlookers. At another point, one of the bots tripped over its own feet and then face-planted on the floor, where it lay for awhile before it decided to get up again. So, not exactly a Mike Tyson situation, but the machines still managed to evoke a spooky kind of humanoid behavior that made for high-quality entertainment. I overheard an observer quip: “That’s too much like Robocop.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The dancer</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dancing robots have long been a staple at CES, and this year was no different. This year, the dance-move torch was carried by bots from Unitree, a major Chinese robotics manufacturer that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://democrats-selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/select-committee-sounds-alarm-ccp-robots-inside-us-institutions\">has been scrutinized</a> for potential ties to the Chinese military. Unitree has made a number of impressive announcements about its product base, including a humanoid bot that can supposedly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a60192610/h1-robot-speed-record/\">run at speeds of up to 11 mph</a>. I didn’t see any evidence of anything nefarious at Unitree’s booth this week—just a lot of bots that were feeling the groove.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The convenience store clerk</strong> </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I stopped by the booth for Galbot, another Chinese company that says it is focused on multi-modal large language models and general purpose robotics. Galbot’s booth had been styled to look like a convenience store, and its bot appeared to have been synched with a menu app. A customer would come to the booth, select an item from the menu, and then the bot would go and fetch the selected merch for them. After I chose Sour Patch Kids, the bot dutifully retrieved a box off the shelf for me. According to the company’s website, the robot has been deployed in a number of real-world settings, including as an assistant <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/5LSp64S8bzXlce8qhoT7vg\">at Chinese pharmacies</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The housekeeper </strong></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creating a machine that can fold laundry has long been one of the core ambitions of the commercial robotics community. The ability to pick up a T-shirt and fold it is considered <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-folding-clothes\">a fundamental test</a> of automated competence. For that reason, I was fairly impressed by the display over at Dyna Robotics, a firm that develops advanced manipulation models for automated tasks. There, a pair of robotic arms could be seen efficiently folding laundry and placing it in a pile. A Dyna representative told me that the firm had already established partnerships with a number of hotels, gyms, and factories.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of those businesses, the rep told me, is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.monsterlaundry.com/robotic-folding-laundromat/\">Monster Laundry</a>, based in Sacramento, California. Monster integrated Dyna’s shirt-folding robot into its operations late last year and now describes itself as the “first laundry center in North America to debut a state-of-the-art robotic folding system from Dyna.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dyna also has some impressive backing. It concluded an $120 million <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.dyna.co/blog/dyna-robotics-closes-120m-series-a\">Series A fundraising round</a> in September that included funding from Nvidia’s NVentures, as well as from Amazon, LG, Salesforce, and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><strong>The butler </strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I also stopped by LG’s section of CES to take a look at its new home robot, CLOid. It was cute but was not the fastest bot on the block. You can read my full review of that experience <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

            "body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"entry-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-constrained wp-block-post-content-is-layout-constrained\">\n<p id=\"speakable-summary\" class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A former SandboxAQ executive filed a wrongful termination suit last month filled with such scandalous allegations against the company’s famed CEO, Jack Hidary, that the plaintiff himself redacted the most salacious details. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On Friday, the company’s lawyers filed a blistering response, calling the former employee a “serial liar” and stating his lawsuit “asserts false claims for improper and extortionate purposes.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even the visible portions of the lawsuit — which TechCrunch has obtained — contain eyebrow-raising allegations, should a court find them valid. (A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/978668181/2025-12-10-Bender-v-SandboxAQ-Et-Al-Redacted-Filed\">copy of the lawsuit is available here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The case offers a rare inside look at how employee lawsuits can become a public airing of dirty laundry from otherwise opaque internal happenings, thanks to the ubiquitous private arbitration clauses in Silicon Valley employee agreements.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The suit was filed by Robert Bender in mid-December. Bender worked as Chief of Staff to Hidary from August 2024 through July 2025, the complaint states. He contends in his suit that he was wrongfully terminated after raising concerns about a number of alleged incidents, some of which, he said, involved “sexual encounters” and others, he claims, that involved misleading financial information presented to investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, SandboxAQ vehemently denies the allegations. The company’s lawyer Orin Snyder, a well-known partner at white shoe law firm Gibson Dunn, tells TechCrunch: “This case is a complete fabrication. We look forward to debunking these baseless allegations and exposing the lawsuit — as detailed in our answer — for what it is — an opportunistic and extortionate abuse of the judicial process.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What makes the case particularly notable is the number of Valley heavy hitters involved in SandboxAQ. The company is an AI quantum computing startup that began as a moonshot unit of Google parent company Alphabet, led at Google by Hidary. Hidary is also well-known in Silicon Valley as a longtime X Prize board member. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SandboxAQ was spun out of Alphabet into an independent company in March 2022 with Hidary as CEO and soon attracted big-name investors, including billionaire and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, who invested and became the startup’s chairman. Other billionaire investors include Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, and Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bender’s attorneys say in <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://webapps.sftc.org/ci/CaseInfo.dll?SessionID=D201BE33850FFB056DD69E4E553D5C50845C82A7&amp;URL=https%3A%2F%2Fimgquery.sftc.org%2FSha1_newApp%2Fmainpage.aspx%3FWeb_Server%3Dimgquery.sftc.org%26MINDS_Server%3Dhoj-imx-01%26Category%3DC%26DocID%3D09992059%26Timestamp%3D20260109125254%26Digest%3De59eb090117bb8255b6b6601453153dcc90e4439\">another court document </a>that the redacted sections “describe sexual encounters and the physical condition of non-party individuals observed by Plaintiff during business travel.” In other words, the alleged incidents involve people who Bender is not suing. This is an unusual move — typically, it’s the party being sued that requests redactions, not the person making the allegations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Various explanations exist for such a tactic, and TechCrunch couldn’t ascertain what the motivations are in this case. Generally speaking, the possibilities range from protecting innocent third parties who aren’t accused of wrongdoing, to a shakedown strategy — signaling that more damaging details could emerge if the defendants don’t offer an acceptable settlement.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The unredacted portion of the suit provides a few more general details of the allegations that were hidden: Bender is alleging that Hidary used company resources and investor funds to “solicit, transport, and entertain female companions.” In an attached exhibit of a text message from Bender, he mentions prostitutes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bender further alleges in his suit that Hidary sold tens of millions of dollars worth of his stock at a premium price based on what Bender says were misleading figures presented to potential investors. He contends in the suit that revenue figures presented to the board were 50% lower than the figures shown in presentations to prospective investors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SandboxAQ’s lawyers vigorously contest all of the above. “The Company did not make fraudulent disclosures to investors regarding its tender offer or otherwise. The CEO did not misuse corporate assets. Plaintiff invented these inflammatory allegations to manufacture statutory claims and to insulate himself from the consequences of his own misconduct.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bender, for his part, alleges that the company has been trying to smear him. His complaint asserts that he brought his lawsuit, “only because his termination was followed by a malicious scorched earth campaign to destroy his reputation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While the validity of any of these allegations is for a jury to decide, many of his claims echo an investigative report on SandboxAQ published by <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/lavish-spending-weak-growth-engulf-billionaire-backed-ai-startup-sandboxaq\">The Information</a> in July.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Sources told The Information that Hidary was using company resources to fly women he was dating on corporate jets, and that the company’s revenues were far below its projections. Bender references The Information story in his lawsuit but denies he was a source for it. SandboxAQ claims he was a source and is lying about his involvement. (A copy of SandboxAQ’s full corporate response, including more allegations about the employee, can be <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/978740301/Sandbox-Answer-1-9-2026\">found here</a>.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite any controversies, big-name investors were eager to invest in the company last year. In April, SandboxAQ <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sandboxaq.com/press/sandboxaq-closes-450m-series-e-round-with-expanded-investor-base\">raised over $450 million</a> in a Series E funding round from Ray Dalio, Horizon Kinetics, BNP Paribas, Google, and Nvidia. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SandboxAQ also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/07/15/sandboxaq-raises-95-million-to-advance-ai-models-that-solve-real-world-problems/\">announced a $90 million secondary sale</a>. SandboxAQ has raised $1 billion total, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://thequantuminsider.com/2025/07/15/sandboxaq-raises-95-million-to-advance-ai-models-that-solve-real-world-problems/\">it says</a>, and is valued at $5.75 billion, according to PitchBook estimates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

And how did the robot fare once it was off the press conference stage and out in the wild? <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/08/i-watched-lgs-new-home-robot-cloid-do-laundry-but-i-have-questions/\">We’ll let Senior Writer Lucas Ropek’s impressions speak for themselves</a>: </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Unfortunately, at the presentation I saw, CLOiD didn’t do a whole lot. I saw the bot very gingerly take a shirt out of a basket and place it into a dryer. I also saw it pick up a croissant and (again, very gingerly) place it into an oven. In addition to the live performance from the bot, the presentation was intercut with highly produced videos of the bot in a number of hypothetical scenarios where it might prove useful to potential users.” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-eufymake-uv-printer-is-an-etsy-maker-s-dream\">eufyMake UV printer is an Etsy maker’s dream </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Long used in industrial settings, UV printers that can print ink directly onto objects have been prohibitively expensive for individuals to own.

And a recent acquisition of a neurotech startup should help Ozlo expand beyond being a consumer product to entering the medical device market, too.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-ozlo-s-platform-ambitions-began\">How Ozlo’s platform ambitions began</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081455\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp 1554w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=680,382 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_clam_blog_cover.webp?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ozlo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded by former Bose employees, Ozlo always intended to build an ecosystem, Ozlo co-founder and CEO NB Patil explained on the sidelines of CES.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way we did that from the beginning is we built the iOS and Android SDK — so our first-party app actually runs on that SDK. That means whatever you see in our app can be made available to anybody,” Patil said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The mental wellness company Calm, for instance, could use the SDK to tell whether its sleep and meditation content is actually resonating with its customers. While Calm can’t tell from its own app if customers have fallen asleep, Ozlo’s sensors could. The device detects how body movements and respiration rates change, and that data is sent to the Ozlo charging case. There, a machine learning algorithm determines whether someone is asleep or is relaxed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozlo’s smart case has other sensors as well, including a temperature sensor and a light sensor that can add more data.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, that information can be shared with apps like Calm and others. (While Patil described the relationship with Calm like this at CES, a rep for Ozlo said the companies don’t currently exchange data.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081456\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp 1251w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=150,65 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=300,129 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=768,331 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=680,293 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=1200,517 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=430,185 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=720,310 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=900,388 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=800,345 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=668,288 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=708,305 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/ozlo_calm.webp?resize=50,22 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ozlo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, if a user started playing a breathing exercise, Ozlo could tell if their respiration rate had gone down and share that data with its partner. If the exercise is unsuccessful, the partner would know they need to change the pattern or do something different. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“So there are two parts,” Patil notes. “Taking real-time action when the customer achieves the desired state [which Ozlo does with its feature that can shut off sounds after the user falls asleep] and the other part, which is very important, actually — that content creators are not quite thinking about — is, are they investing in the right content?” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Patil explains that content creators for these types of meditation and sleeping aid apps tend to invest in volume without measuring whether or not their content is effective. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They don’t understand, actually, how it works in the field because there is no data,” he says. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081511\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg?resize=150,110 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg?resize=300,220 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg?resize=430,315 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg?resize=513,375 513w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/imgi_5_BH-ANNIE_SELECT_still_export_0040-Edit_1.jpg?resize=50,37 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ozlo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This relationship could also add another revenue stream to Ozlo’s business beyond selling hardware. For instance, if a customer is prompted to upgrade their subscription to the partner’s product, Ozlo could take a portion of that transaction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Patil told TechCrunch the company is already in discussions with other sleep and meditation apps, but this closed-loop feedback system could be used with any sort of content, including therapy or even audiobooks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozlo is also working on tinnitus therapy tools to address the ear-ringing problem that affects 15% of its customer base. The company teamed up with Walter Reed Hospital last year to launch a clinical study of the problem and found that playing the right masking frequency overnight for many weeks can fool the brain into stopping the irritating signals producing the ringing sounds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Patil says the tinnitus therapies will be available via a subscription and will roll out in the second quarter of 2026.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-an-ai-to-help-you-sleep-better\">An AI to help you sleep better </h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3081454\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg 2161w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=150,122 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=300,243 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=768,623 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=680,551 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=1200,973 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=1280,1038 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=430,349 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=720,584 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=900,730 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=800,649 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=1536,1245 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=2048,1660 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=668,542 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=463,375 463w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=761,617 761w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=655,531 655w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0660.jpg?resize=50,41 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Ozlo</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozlo is also working to expand the insights it provides its own customers, and AI is an increasingly important piece. The company <a href=\"https://ozlosleep.com/blogs/blogs/introducing-sleep-patterns-from-ozlo-better-sleep-backed-by-insight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">launched Sleep Patterns within its app in November</a> to help customers understand how long and well they’ve slept, what their patterns are across the past weeks, and what factors could be disturbing their rest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This year, Ozlo plans to introduce an AI agent that customers can text with and use as a “sleep buddy.” (Coincidentally, the company revealed the “buddy” name in an Easter egg within the app. The app displays an animated character — “buddy” — that runs across the top of the screen when you open and close the case five times in a row.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By integrating with other wearables and Apple’s HealthKit, Ozlo will be able to better understand a user’s patterns and what they need to sleep better. It also wants to be able to connect with IoT devices, like smart thermostats, to set the right sleeping temperature for users as soon as they open the case at night.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI features are expected in the second quarter. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-new-hardware-eeg-insights-on-the-way\">New hardware, EEG insights on the way</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ozlo’s next-generation case will address the issue of the earbuds sometimes not being properly seated in the charger.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We changed the contours inside the case — when you place [the sleepbud], it’s perfect. And then we’ll have a Bluetooth button to do the pairing,” Patil says. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the new device will include a redesigned antenna and extender for improved range, and will add an amplifier to boost how loud the headphones can be to drown out plane and train noise, when needed. This updated hardware will also arrive in Q2.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In terms of products, Ozlo will launch a bedside speaker in Q2 that will offer similar functionality to the Sleepbuds, but won’t need to go in the ear. A 4×6-inch speaker would also have its own sensor, allowing it to do things like tracking how many times you woke up for bathroom breaks, or alert others if you had fallen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The speaker would allow the company to market to families with children under 13, as kids aren’t advised to wear earbuds at night. It could also make sense for elderly individuals who aren’t as technically savvy and don’t want to fiddle with in-ear devices.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=L&amp;pf=1&amp;ai=DChsSEwiuw9fLj_-RAxUYakcBHeV_IaUYACICCAEQBxoCcXU&amp;co=1&amp;ase=2&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA64LLBhBhEiwA-Pxgu98RSkZnHYKjo5EpXNZcKlhTUkBFBkP12GMvcDvUBTfGYNIPIyKhpBoCnEcQAvD_BwE&amp;cid=CAAS0wHkaI06n2gt-vz13grkMXy4v4WcU1ww6D5RviNLZuty2X0vaXY6MaRuhGzBdvDc00bH7Bv64w5-7-Px3rOOIRoPWmrr1DVlj2RAVkywsOBMY0Rh-QpR7GUvIThwGSFl375EODw8TfPwZtws9-62NrWloO_i_MmC3W5nn9JdSOIjsAjWt9Hs629TpragAqYbzh2upp3TPlyIWHdFh-l-Er-XhBgcX8Mzzhswk1pvHhjrOuvRgRajeB27CsVta33VmCIQa1FHukOnmeq3nH9CFiX8uO37&amp;cce=2&amp;category=acrcp_v1_32&amp;sig=AOD64_2Mb5uhnHiZ2nHLJXf_L0e6VwXpzQ&amp;q&amp;nis=4&amp;adurl=https://www.hatch.co/?utm_source%3Dgoogle_search%26utm_medium%3Dpaid_search%26utm_campaign%3D16106137135%26utm_adgroup%3D186291917698%26utm_content%3D773548259655%26utm_term%3Dhatch%2520alarm%2520clock%26utm_device%3Dc%26gad_source%3D1%26gad_campaignid%3D16106137135%26gbraid%3D0AAAAADh7rJOywgifezujFvQwjMYUaVcwV%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiA64LLBhBhEiwA-Pxgu98RSkZnHYKjo5EpXNZcKlhTUkBFBkP12GMvcDvUBTfGYNIPIyKhpBoCnEcQAvD_BwE&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiap9DLj_-RAxWwElkFHR6XBk4Q0Qx6BAgVEAE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">popular Hatch alarm clock</a>, Ozlo is working on adding a light to a product in the future to gently wake you up.

Ozlo believes this will allow it to bring brain-level insights to its consumer device and later develop tools to do real-time sleep intervention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Basically, we are custom designing the eartip that is going to measure the electrical signals from your ear. From that, actually, you can derive the delta signals from the brain, and you should be able to say what your brain is doing when it comes to sleep, or when it comes to awareness, and all that,” Patil explained.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A product incorporating the EEG technology will launch in 2027, allowing the company to move into the medical products field, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the busy year ahead, Ozlo will need to execute well on each new feature and product in rapid order to maintain its current pace and grow its customer base. It will also need additional capital.

Startups and existing reactors have benefited from the race for data center power, though in different ways.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Existing reactors tend to be the cheapest form of baseload capacity, but there are only so many to go around, which has pushed Meta and its peers toward SMR startups. Companies like Oklo and TerraPower are betting that by building a large number of smaller reactors, they’ll be able to bring the cost down through mass manufacturing. It’s a plausible hypothesis, though one that has yet to be tested. Meta’s deal could give SMR startups a chance to prove it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deals are the result of a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/04/meta-jumps-aboard-the-nuclear-powered-data-center-bandwagon/\">request for proposals that Meta issued</a> in December 2024, in which Meta sought partners that could add between 1 to 4 gigawatts of generating capacity by the early 2030s. Much of the new power will flow through the PJM interconnection, a grid which covers 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states and has become saturated with data centers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 20-year agreement with Vistra will have the most immediate impact on Meta’s energy needs. The tech company will buy a total of 2.1 gigawatts from two existing nuclear power plants, Perry and Davis-Besse in Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, Vistra will also add capacity to those power plants and to its Beaver Valley power plant in Pennsylvania. Together, the upgrades will generate an additional 433 MW and are scheduled to come online in the early 2030s.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta is also buying 1.2 gigawatts from young provider Oklo. Under its deal with Meta, Oklo is hoping to start supplying power to the grid as early as 2030. The SMR company <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/climate-tech-spacs-altc-oklo/\">went public via SPAC</a> in 2023, and while Oklo has landed a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/18/sam-altman-backed-nuclear-startup-oklo-lands-massive-data-center-power-deal-with-caveats/\">large deal with data center operator Switch</a>, it has struggled to get its reactor design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If Oklo can deliver on its timeline, the new reactors would be built in Pike County, Ohio. The startup’s Aurora Powerhouse reactors each produce 75 megawatts of electricity, and it will need to build more than a dozen to fulfill Meta’s order.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TerraPower is a startup co-founded by Bill Gates, and it is aiming to start sending electricity to Meta as early as 2032. It has designed a reactor that uses molten sodium to transfer energy from reactor to generator. When demand is low, the superheated salt can be stored in an insulated vat until more power is needed. The reactor can generate 345 megawatts of electricity, while the storage system can provide an additional 100 to 500 megawatts for more than five hours. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has navigated the NRC process more smoothly, and it is working with GE Hitachi to build its first power plant in Wyoming. Its first two reactors for Meta would provide 690 megawatts, and Meta said it has rights to buy another six units for a total of 2.8 gigawatts of nuclear capacity and 1.2 gigawatts of storage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta did not disclose financial terms of the deals. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The power purchases from Vistra are certain to be the cheapest — electricity from already operating nuclear reactors is among the cheapest on the grid. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Costs for SMRs still have yet to be worked out. Several startups have aggressive cost targets: TerraPower has estimated that it can bring it down to <a href=\"https://eepower.com/news/bill-gates-backed-terrapower-plans-unusual-nuclear-reactor/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$50 to $60 per megawatt-hour</a>, while Oklo has said it is aiming for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oklos-nuclear-order-book-shows-potential-small-reactors-2024-07-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$80 to $130 per megawatt-hour</a>. Those figures are for later power plants — the first examples are likely to cost more.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The haul represents over 18% of all venture capital dollars allocated in the United States in 2025, according to firm co-founder Ben Horowitz, but even more jaw-dropping is that it brings the organization to more than $90 billion in assets under management, putting it neck-and-neck with Sequoia Capital as among the largest venture firms in the world. Which is fitting, since a16z appears to be very friendly with actual sovereign wealth funds, including at least one from Saudi Arabia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm, which employs many hundreds of people across five offices — three in California, plus New York and Washington, D.C. — has become a globe-spanning operation with employees on six continents. In December, it opened its first Asia office in Seoul for its crypto practice.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That newly committed capital breaks down across five funds: $6.75 billion for growth investments, $1.7 billion each for apps and infrastructure, $1.176 billion for “American Dynamism” (more on that shortly), $700 million for biotech and healthcare, and another $3 billion for other venture strategies. It’s the kind of money that makes you wonder where it all comes from and, more importantly, where it all goes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “where it comes from” question is one the firm has historically declined to answer. When we asked a16z this week about its limited partners and its distributed-to-paid-in capital ratio — the DPI, or how much actual cash the firm has returned to investors over its 16-year history — the firm didn’t respond. What we do know is that <a href=\"https://www.calpers.ca.gov/documents/202503-invest-agenda-item04e-01-a/download?inline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CalPERS</a> invested $400 million in 2023, marking the first time in a16z’s history it took money from a major California pension fund, probably because institutions with transparency requirements don’t really align with the firm’s preference for opacity. We also know that Sanabil Investments, the venture arm of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, <a href=\"https://www.sanabil.com/en/Our-Portfolio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">lists</a> Andreessen Horowitz among its portfolio holdings.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Saudi connection isn’t subtle. Back in 2023, Horowitz and Marc Andreessen appeared onstage with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann to discuss their $350 million investment in his then-new residential real estate venture, Flow. The venue was a conference backed by one of Saudi Arabia’s largest sovereign funds. Horowitz praised Saudi Arabia as a “startup country,” adding that “Saudi has a founder; you don’t call him a founder, you <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/01/andreessen-horowitz-is-now-openly-courting-capital-from-saudi-arabia-despite-u-s-strains/\">call him his royal highness</a>.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Marc Andreessen has found another royal to admire. Since President Donald Trump’s November 2024 election victory, Andreessen has logged a lot of hours at Mar-a-Lago, by his own account, helping shape policy on tech, business, and economics. Early last year, he became an “<a href=\"https://x.com/HooverInst/status/1879251881597472913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">unpaid intern</a>” at Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, vetting candidates for the Trump administration — not just for tech roles but for positions in the Defense Department and intelligence agencies. Scott Kupor, a16z’s first employee back in 2009, was sworn in as director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management this past summer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This matters because a16z’s current strategy is heavily weighted toward what it calls “American Dynamism” — a practice that invests in defense, aerospace, public safety, housing, education, and manufacturing. The portfolio aligns remarkably well with Defense Department priorities: Anduril (autonomous defense systems), Shield AI (military drones), Saronic Technologies (autonomous naval vessels), and Castelion (hypersonic missiles). The bigger bet is that America needs to reindustrialize and reshore critical manufacturing, particularly since, as a16z itself notes, the U.S. would exhaust its entire missile inventory “in something like 8 days” in a conflict with China over Taiwan, then need three years to rebuild it.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s the AI bet, which might be the firm’s highest-risk, highest-reward play yet. a16z has positioned itself across every level of the AI stack: infrastructure (Databricks), foundation models (with stakes in Mistral AI, OpenAI and xAI), and applications (<a href=\"http://character.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Character.AI</a>, among many other portfolio companies). </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The firm has wins to point to. Its $25 million investment in Coinbase turned into an $86 billion valuation at the 2021 IPO. There’s Airbnb (public at over $100 billion), Slack (acquired for $27.7 billion), and GitHub ($7.5 billion to Microsoft). Its <a href=\"https://tracxn.com/d/venture-capital/andreessen-horowitz/__oEAKrCATGdFfCsrPN-DhXby6dmugBcIAllHOAiIiWII\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">portfolio</a> includes 115 unicorns, 35 IPOs, and 241 acquisitions, according to the market intelligence firm Tracxn. The firm has also made and lost money by snapping up cryptocurrency tokens, though there’s less visibility into those numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a <a href=\"https://a16z.com/why-did-we-raise-15b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> published Friday morning, Horowitz writes that “as the American leader in Venture Capital, the fate of new technology in the United States rests partly on our shoulders.” It’s the kind of statement certain to cause agita at rival firms, some of which have been around closer to 50 years, compared with the much younger a16z. Horowitz frames a16z’s mission as “ensuring that America wins the next 100 years of technology.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Whether that happens remains to be seen. What’s certain is that Andreessen Horowitz has mastered the art of raising money — $15 billion this time — to fund a vision of American technological dominance that runs through Riyadh, Mar-a-Lago, and the Pentagon. That’s quite a pitch, and plainly, it works.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
