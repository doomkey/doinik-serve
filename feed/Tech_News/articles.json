Meta had originally planned to launch the glasses in France, Italy, Canada, and the U.K. in early 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Since launching last fall, we’ve seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,” the company said. “Because of this unprecedented demand and limited inventory, we’ve decided to pause our planned international expansion.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta says it will continue focusing on fulfilling U.S. orders while it re-evaluates its approach to international availability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/17/meta-unveils-new-smart-glasses-with-a-display-and-wristband-controller/\">Unveiled</a> in September, the Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses are controlled by a wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which detects subtle hand gestures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES this week in Las Vegas, Meta showed off new features coming to the glasses and the Neural Band. The glasses are getting a new teleprompter feature that gives users a portable way to deliver prepared remarks. Plus, users can now jot down messages using their finger on any surface while wearing Meta Neural Band and have those movements transcribed into digital messages.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meta is also expanding pedestrian navigation to Denver, Las Vegas, Portland, and Salt Lake City. </p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

They also let you control lighting and appliances that are connected to your smart home network. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new app store to the Ring app to allow users to use its cameras with third-party apps. The store is currently available in the U.S. only, and users will be able to browse a selection of apps in the coming weeks. While the company didn’t specify what kind of apps the store would feature, it said these apps would focus on small business operations and everyday needs around the house.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And as fires grow more common in drought affected areas, the company has teamed up with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/09/watch-duty-surpasses-chatgpt-as-top-free-app-on-app-store-as-california-fires-spread/\">the fire monitoring app, Watch Duty</a>, to show real-time updates and early warnings in the Ring app’s Neighbors section. Users can also share live updates using their Ring cameras to this section. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, the new devices being launched support Amazon’s Sidewalk shared network feature, which creates a mesh network between the company’s Echo and Ring devices by sharing a small portion of your bandwidth, enabling devices to work even when they aren’t in wireless range of your Wi-Fi router.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon is also adding a new AI-based feature to Ring cameras that learns the everyday patterns of a property and alerts users if anything unusual occurs. Dubbed “AI Unusual Event Alerts,” the company said the feature enables the Ring camera to surface specific warnings when it detects a person, based on location, actions and clothing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For people who subscribe to Amazon’s Virtual Security Guard services, these warnings could trigger intervention automatically. In the last month, the company has rolled out features that use video recognition to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/18/amazons-new-alexa-feature-adds-conversational-ai-to-ring-doorbells/\">trigger Alexa responses</a> and send you <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">personalized notifications based on a database of 50 faces</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company has also launched a new Ring Car Alarm with in-built GPS for vehicle monitoring.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The device uses two 1080p RGB cameras with a 136-degree field of view to map out the area and recognize different kinds of objects using AI models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Narwal said that through this tech stack, the vacuum cleaner has the ability to identify an unlimited number of objects. The device first tries to identify an object locally, but in case there are no matches, it sends the data to the cloud for further processing. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080177\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg 4096w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/009.jpeg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Narwal</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Narwal</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Flow 2 has three key modes called pet care mode, baby care mode, and AI floor tag mode. With pet care mode, you can define zones where pets usually rest or hang out to clean them. Plus, it can monitor pets and also check in on your pets via two-way audio (there is no guarantee that they would listen to you, though). In the baby care mode, the vacuum switches to quiet mode near the crib and notifies you of misplaced toys. In the AI floor tag mode, the vacuum recognizes valuable items like jewelry, avoids them, and alerts you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Narwal said that its newest vacuum cleaner has four cleaning modes that can identify different types of dirt. The device can also return to its base to wash the mop and then re-mop a certain area if it is dirty. The company noted that the Flow 2’s design allows for a higher hot water washing temperature for better cleaning.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?w=318\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080178\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg 4136w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=70,150 70w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=140,300 140w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=768,1644 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=318,680 318w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=560,1200 560w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=598,1280 598w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=201,430 201w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=336,720 336w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=420,900 420w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=374,800 374w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=717,1536 717w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=956,2048 956w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=312,668 312w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=175,375 175w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=288,617 288w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=248,531 248w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/001.jpeg?resize=23,50 23w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 318px) 100vw, 318px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Image Credits: Narwal</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Along with the Flow 2, the company also showed off a handheld vacuum called the U50 that weighs 1.41kg (3.1 lbs) and has UV-C sterilization along with heat treatment for allergen removal.

That represents a growth 2x over the last year, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“In the years ahead, AI is going to be a multi-layered fabric that gets woven into every level of computing at the personal layer,” Tikoo said. “Our AI PCs and devices will transform how we work, how we play, how we create and how we connect with each other.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">AMD also announced the release of the AMD Ryzen 7 9850X3D, the latest version of its gaming-focused processor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“No matter who you are and how you use technology on a daily basis, AI is reshaping everyday computing,” Tikoo said. “You have thousands of interactions with your PC every day.

I’m trying to change that.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry began working at Insight Partners in 2022, after previously working for Meta, McKinsey &amp; Company, and an early-stage startup. The suit alleges that, upon being hired, she was assigned to a different supervisor than the person mentioned during her interview.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She alleges in the suit that she was told by her new supervisor, who was a woman, to be “online all the time, including PTO, holidays, and weekends,” and to respond between “6 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry says in the suit that this first supervisor “berated, hazed, and antagonized” her, spoke openly about a hazing that would be “longer and more intense” than what she put other male reports through.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some comments the supervisor allegedly made, according to the suit, include “you are incompetent, shut up and take notes” and “you need to obey me like a dog; do whatever I say whenever I say it, without speaking.”  Lowry also alleges that her supervisor assigned her “redundant tasks” and restricted her ability to participate in calls, while allowing less experienced male colleagues to do so. Lowry, instead, she alleges, was relegated to “administrative tasks such as note-taking and cataloging.”  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lowry said she became “increasingly ill” because of the work environment and that her physician advised a medical leave of absence, which she was granted and took from February to July 2023.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When she returned to work, she was placed on a new team and, the suit alleges, was told by the head of human resources that “if the new team did not like her, she would be fired.”  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In September 2023, Lowry said she got a concussion and took another medical leave and returned to work near the end of 2024. Due to some departures, she was placed under the supervision of a new person, where Lowry said her poor treatment continued. She also alleges that in 2024, her compensation was about 30% below the market. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By April 2025, she alleges she was told her compensation would be cut. In May of 2025, through her attorneys, Lowry sent a letter to Insight regarding her alleged treatment by the company. A week later, the firm terminated her employment, the suit states.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The lawsuit is reminiscent of Ellen Pao’s suit against Kleiner Perkins back in 2012, in which she alleged discrimination and retaliation. That suit offered what was, at the time, a rare glimpse into how women partners felt they were treated in venture capital. Though Pao lost that suit, it sent waves through the industry, and <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/former-employee-sues-facebook-for-sex-and-race-discrimination/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other women went on to sue</a> major tech companies.  </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

He hopes the industry will start talking about it as a human-helper productivity tool instead.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s the problem with that framing, though: Much of AI agent marketing uses the idea of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/artisan-the-stop-hiring-humans-ai-agent-startup-raises-25m-and-is-still-hiring-humans/\">replacing human labor</a> as a way to price it, and justify its expense.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, some of the biggest names in AI have been sounding the alarm that the tech will soon cause very high levels of human unemployment. For instance, in May Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/02/ai-job-predictions-become-corporate-americas-newest-competitive-sport/\">could take away half of all entry-level white-collar jobs</a>, raising unemployment to 10-20% over the next five years, and he doubled down on that last month in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Ln3PTyByci0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an interview on 60 Minutes</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Yet we currently don’t know how true such doomsday stats are. As Nadella implies, most AI tools today don’t replace workers, they are used by them (as long as the human doesn’t mind <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/14/vibe-coding-has-turned-senior-devs-into-ai-babysitters-but-they-say-its-worth-it/\">checking the AI’s work for accuracy</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One oft-cited research study is MIT’s ongoing <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Project Iceberg</a>, which seeks to measure the economic impact on jobs as AI enters the workforce. Project Iceberg estimates that AI is currently capable of performing about 11.7% of human paid labor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While this has been widely reported as AI being capable of replacing nearly 12% of jobs, the Project says what it’s actually estimating is <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/#faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">how much of a job can be offloaded to AI</a>. It then calculates wages attached to that offloaded work. Interestingly, the <a href=\"https://iceberg.mit.edu/report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">tasks it cites as examples</a> include automated paperwork for nurses and AI-written computer code.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That’s not to say there are no jobs being heavily impacted by AI. Corporate graphic artists and marketing bloggers are two examples, according to a Substack called <a href=\"https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-ai-is-killing-jobs-in-the-tech-f39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Blood in the Machine</a>. Then there are the high unemployment rates among <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/10/the-computer-science-dream-has-become-a-nightmare/\">new-grad junior coders</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But it’s also true that highly skilled artists, writers, and programmers produce better work with AI tools than those without the skills. AI can’t replace human creativity, yet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So it’s perhaps no surprise that as we slide into 2026, some data is emerging that shows the jobs where AI has made the most progress are actually flourishing. <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/isg_vemo_2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Vanguard’s 2026 economic forecast report</a> found that “the approximately 100 occupations most exposed to AI automation are actually outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of job growth and real wage increases.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Vanguard report concludes that those who are masterfully using AI are making themselves more valuable, not replaceable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The irony is that Microsoft’s own actions last year helped give rise to the AI-is-coming-for-our-jobs narrative. The company laid off <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/24/microsoft-satya-nadella-memo-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">over 15,000 people in 2025</a>, even as it recorded record revenues and profits for its <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar25/index.html#:~:text=Financially%2C%20it%20was%20a%20year,We%20take%20neither%20for%20granted.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">last fiscal year, which closed in June</a> — citing success with AI as a reason. Nadella even wrote a<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> public memo</a> about the layoffs after these results.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Notably, he didn’t say that internal AI efficiency led to cuts. But he <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-says-companys-mission-193700847.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">did say</a> that Microsoft had to “reimagine our mission for a new era” and named “AI transformation” as one of the company’s three business objectives in this era (the other two being security and quality).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The truth about job loss attributed to AI during 2025 is more nuanced. As the Vanguard report points out, this had less to do with internal AI efficiency and more to do with ordinary business practices that are less exciting to investors, like ending investment in slowing areas to pile in to growing ones.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To be fair, Microsoft wasn’t alone in laying off workers while pursuing AI. The technology was said to be responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. in 2025, according to research from firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/21/ai-job-cuts-amazon-microsoft-and-more-cite-ai-for-2025-layoffs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CNBC reported.</a> That report cited the large cuts last year at Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech companies chasing AI.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to be fair to slop, those of us who spend more time than we should on social media laughing at memes and AI-generated short-form videos might argue that slop is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/01/openais-new-social-app-is-filled-with-terrifying-sam-altman-deepfakes/\">one of AI’s most entertaining (if not best) uses</a>, too.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

On Monday, the companies said the robotaxi is already being tested on public roads ahead of a planned commercial service launching in the San Francisco Bay Area later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Based on the Lucid Gravity SUV, the robotaxi has high-resolution cameras, solid state lidar sensors, and radars integrated into the body and the roof-mounted “halo.” The autonomy package is powered by Nvidia’s Drive AGX Thor computer. That halo also has integrated LED lights that will help riders identify their vehicle (similar to how Waymo’s Jaguar I-Pace SUVs work).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Crucially, all of this extra tech is added to the Gravity as it’s being built at Lucid Motors’ Casa Grande, Arizona factory, saving the companies some time and money. By comparison, Waymo currently has to take apart the I-Pace SUVs it receives from Jaguar and integrate the autonomous tech as it puts them back together. (Future Waymo vehicles are planned to be more purpose-built.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080009\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg 3713w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/uber-lucid-nuro.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Sean O'Kane</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The vehicle unveiled on Monday is a more polished-up version of the test version that the three companies have spent the last seven months showing off in press photos. The newest element revealed at CES has to do with how users will interface with the Uber-Lucid-Nuro robotaxi. That includes a small screen on the halo meant to greet riders and a ride interface inside the cabin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anyone who has ridden in a Waymo will find this UI experience familiar. The rear passenger screen shows an isometric graphical view of the robotaxi moving through city streets, with representations of nearby cars and pedestrians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The companies did not have an interactive version of the software — which is being created by Uber — ready to test out just yet. But it has been built to show the standard information like estimated drop-off time, how much ride time is remaining, and climate and music controls. There are also buttons to reach rider support and to tell the robotaxi to pull over.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The front passenger screen shows a lot of the same information, just on a larger central touchscreen display. In the demonstration car on display at the Fontainebleau hotel, a lot of the same elements appeared on the Gravity’s sweeping 34-inch curved OLED display, which sits behind the steering wheel. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber chose to build this forthcoming “premium” robotaxi service around the Gravity, and at a high level it seems like a wise decision. The Gravity is immensely spacious inside, especially in the two-row configuration on display at the hotel. (Uber says a three-row version will be available, too.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That said, the Gravity’s first full year came with struggles. Lucid fought with software issues as it ramped up production of the SUV, and the problems got bad enough that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to owners in December apologizing for the “frustrations” they experienced. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lucid has seemingly been able to bounce back from that, and on Monday <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/05/lucid-motors-doubled-ev-output-in-2025-after-early-gravity-suv-struggles/\">announced</a> that it doubled its 2024 production figures and reached new sales records. Time will tell if the robotaxi version has any of the same kinds of software struggles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Uber, Lucid, and Nuro said Monday that once final validation is complete on the robotaxi later this year, true production versions will start rolling off Lucid’s factory lines in Arizona. The companies did not give a concrete timeline for that, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

GR00T relies on Cosmos Reason as its brain, and it unlocks whole-body control for humanoids so they can move and handle objects simultaneously. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia also introduced Isaac Lab-Arena at CES, an open source simulation framework hosted on GitHub that serves as another component of the company’s physical AI platform, enabling safe virtual testing of robotic capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The platform promises to address a critical industry challenge: As robots learn increasingly complex tasks, from precise object handling to cable installation, validating these abilities in physical environments can be costly, slow, and risky. Isaac Lab-Arena tackles this by consolidating resources, task scenarios, training tools, and established benchmarks like Libero, RoboCasa, and RoboTwin, creating a unified standard where the industry previously lacked one.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Supporting the ecosystem is Nvidia OSMO, an open source command center that serves as connective infrastructure that integrates the entire workflow from data generation through training across both desktop and cloud environments. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And to help power it all, there’s the new Blackwell-powered Jetson T4000 graphics card, the newest member of the Thor family. Nvidia is pitching it as a cost-effective on-device compute upgrade that delivers 1200 teraflops of AI compute and 64 gigabytes of memory while running efficiently at 40 to 70 watts. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nvidia is also deepening its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-teams-up-with-hugging-face-to-offer-cloud-based-ai-training/\">partnership with Hugging Face</a> to let more people experiment with robot training without needing expensive hardware or specialized knowledge. The collaboration integrates Nvidia’s Isaac and GR00T technologies into Hugging Face’s LeRobot framework, connecting Nvidia’s 2 million robotics developers with Hugging Face’s 13 million AI builders. The developer platform’s open source <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/14/hugging-face-buys-a-humanoid-robotics-startup/\">Reachy 2</a> humanoid now works directly with Nvidia’s Jetson Thor chip, letting developers experiment with different AI models without being locked into proprietary systems.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The bigger picture here is that Nvidia is trying to make robotics development more accessible, and it wants to be the underlying hardware and software vendor powering it, much like Android is the default for smartphone makers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are early signs that Nvidia’s strategy is working. Robotics is the fastest growing category on Hugging Face, with Nvidia’s models leading downloads. Meanwhile robotics companies, from Boston Dynamics and Caterpillar to Franka Robots and NEURA Robotics, are already using Nvidia’s tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Rubin systems will also be used in <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/blue-lion-vera-rubin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">HPE’s Blue Lion supercomputer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nersc.gov/what-we-do/computing-for-science/doudna-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the upcoming Doudna supercomputer</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Named for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22576927/vera-rubin-dark-matter-astronomy-biography\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the astronomer Vera Florence Cooper Rubin</a>, the Rubin architecture consists of six separate chips designed to be used in concert. The Rubin GPU stands at the center, but the architecture also addresses growing bottlenecks in storage and interconnection with new improvements in the Bluefield and NVLink, systems respectively. The architecture also includes a new Vera CPU, designed for agentic reasoning.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Explaining the benefits of the new storage, Nvidia’s senior director of AI infrastructure solutions Dion Harris pointed to the growing cache-related memory demands of modern AI systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As you start to enable new types of workflows, like agentic AI or long-term tasks, that puts a lot of stress and requirements on your KV cache,” Harris told reporters on a call, referring to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/tensormesh-raises-4-5m-to-squeeze-more-inference-out-of-ai-server-loads/\">a memory system used by AI models to condense inputs</a>. “So we’ve introduced a new tier of storage that connects externally to the compute device, which allows you to scale your storage pool much more efficiently.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As expected, the new architecture also represents a significant advance in speed and power efficiency. According to Nvidia’s tests, the Rubin architecture will operate three and a half times faster than the previous Blackwell architecture on model-training tasks and five times faster on inference tasks, reaching as high as 50 petaflops. The new platform will also support eight times more inference compute per watt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rubin’s new capabilities come amid intense competition to build AI infrastructure, which has seen both AI labs and cloud providers scramble for Nvidia chips as well as the facilities necessary to power them. On an earnings call in October 2025, Huang estimated that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\">between $3 trillion and $4 trillion</a> will be spent on AI infrastructure over the next five years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Boston Dynamics’ humanoid robot Atlas will be the first test case, according to Carolina Parada, senior director of robotics at Google DeepMind.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re looking to integrate our cutting-edge AI foundation models with Boston Dynamics’ new Atlas robots, and we’ll aim to develop the world’s most advanced robot foundation model to fulfill the promise of true general-purpose human needs,” Parada said onstage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The tie-up comes less than a year after the Google AI research lab announced new AI models called Gemini Robotics that are designed to allow robots to perceive, reason, use tools, and interact with humans. Gemini Robotics is based on a large-scale multimodal generative AI model, Gemini. At the time, Google DeepMind said the robotics AI model was trained to generalize behavior across a range of different robotics hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Enter Boston Dynamics, and its majority owner, Hyundai Motor Group. While accelerating research will be a central piece of this partnership, this has real-world scaling intent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Boston Dynamics already has products, like the quadruped Spot, that are in customers’ hands in more than 40 countries. Its warehouse robot Stretch has unloaded more than 20 million boxes globally since its launch in 2023, according to Hyundai. Now Boston Dynamics and Hyundai are preparing for the next generation, starting with the humanoid robot Atlas, which the company announced Monday is already in production and headed to the Hyundai factory in Savannah, Georgia</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A prototype of Atlas walked onstage during the press conference, showing off its ability to move. But as Alberto Rodriguez, director of Atlas behavior at Boston Dynamics, noted, making “Atlas into a product requires more than athletic performance for humanoids to really deliver on their promise. They have to be able to interact with people naturally.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rodriguez and his counterparts at Boston Dynamics believe that recent advancements in AI have created a clear path to get to those capabilities. That kind of natural interaction with humans has real safety implications. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Atlas product, which was also revealed onstage Monday and will eventually head to Hyundai’s factory, has 56 degrees of freedom with rotation joints and human-scale hands that have tactile sensing. And it’s strong. The Atlas robot can lift up to 110 pounds and is designed to perform repetitive movements. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With that kind of dexterity and strength, it will be critical for Atlas, or any humanoid robot, to safely interact and work with humans. Some of that has been handled on the hardware side; Atlas, for instance, has 360-degree cameras to allow it to see when people are approaching. But DeepMind’s work could help the robots learn how to act.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Rather than having a set of predefined, loaded tasks onto the robot, we think robots should understand the physical world the same way we do,”Parada said. “They should be able to learn from their experience. Should be able to generalize new situations and get better over time. So whether it is to assemble a new car part or to tie your shoelaces, robots should learn the same way we do from a handful of examples, and then get better very quickly with a little bit of practice.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai, which plans to bring Atlas to its factory this year and eventually deploy them for tasks like parts sequencing by 2028, has also developed protocols to increase safety and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hyundai said Monday it is opening a U.S. facility this year called a Robot Metaplant Application Center, or RMAC, that will teach robots how to map movements like lifts and turns. Training data from RMAC will be combined with real-world data collected via a software platform used in its Georgia factory to continually improve the robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Follow along with all of TechCrunch’s <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">coverage of the annual CES conference here</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This article was updated to include more information about Atlas’ specs. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It tells you what action it’s going to take, the reasons by which it came about that action. And then, of course, the trajectory.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alpamayo 1’s underlying code is available on Hugging Face. Developers can fine-tune Alpamayo into smaller, faster versions for vehicle development, use it to train simpler driving systems, or build tools on top of it like auto-labeling systems that automatically tag video data or evaluators that check if a car made a smart decision. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“They can also use Cosmos to generate synthetic data and then train and test their Alpamayo-based AV application on the combination of the real and synthetic dataset,” Kani said. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/nvidia-unveils-new-cosmos-world-models-other-infra-for-physical-applications-of-ai/\">Cosmos</a> is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/06/nvidia-releases-its-own-brand-of-world-models/\">Nvidia’s brand of generative world models</a>, AI systems that create a representation of a physical environment so they can make predictions and take actions. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the Alpamayo rollout, Nvidia is also releasing an open dataset with more than 1,700 hours of driving data collected across a range of geographies and conditions, covering rare and complex real-world scenarios. The company is additionally launching AlpaSim, an open source simulation framework for validating autonomous driving systems. Available on GitHub, AlpaSim is designed to recreate real-world driving conditions, from sensors to traffic, so developers can safely test systems at scale.</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The chip uses near-field magnetic positioning to recognize the Tags around it, as well as a miniature speaker, accelerometer, and LED array. Lego also developed a Bluetooth-based protocol called BrickNet, which allows multiple Smart Bricks to recognize each other and operate in tandem. The company claims that BrickNet is protected by enhanced encryption and privacy controls (all of which is necessary, but imagine a world where hacking into toys wasn’t a concern!).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s no setup required to pair the elements of the Smart Play system, making it easy for kids to get started — and parents will be pleased to note that there are no screens involved in the Smart system at all. However, Lego’s website says that there will be a Smart Tag for animating Lego toilets, so… there’s that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lego’s first two Smart Play sets — which are both Star Wars-themed — will launch on March 1, though preorders open on Friday. The “Luke’s Red Five X-wing” building set will retail for $69.99, while the larger “Throne Room Duel and A-wing” set will cost $159.99. These sets use the Smart Play system to animate characters like Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, allowing them to interact with Smart Tags, which enable Lightsaber duels among other Star Wars-related capabilities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Nearly half that project is currently operational.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Department of the Interior cited national security concerns in its decision to stop construction on the projects. Though it didn’t mention specifics, the Trump administration may have been referencing the challenges wind turbines present to radar operations. The Department of Energy had issued a report that discussed this <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/EXEC-2022-004484%20-%20Report%20to%20Congress%20as%20of%20December%2014%202023%20(2).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">security concern, as well as solutions to it, in February 2024</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wind turbines’ whirling blades have been known to stymie radar systems, but researchers in the government and private companies have been working to mitigate the problem for well over a decade. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Choosing the precise site for wind energy projects is one of the biggest ways to ameliorate interference.

That would be well up from the <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/hesai-becomes-the-worlds-first-lidar-company-to-produce-1-million-units-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">1 million-plus unit mark that Hesai hit in 2025</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai’s push to grab more market share comes just one month after leading U.S. lidar-maker Luminar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. That company is not expected to continue operating once its bankruptcy plan is approved, though it is looking to sell the lidar business.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the last few years and is now listed on both the Nasdaq and the Hong Kong stock exchanges. That’s despite fighting an uphill battle against the U.S. government, which has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/chinas-hesai-loses-lawsuit-against-us-government-blacklisting-2025-07-12/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">accused the company</a> of working closely with China’s military industry — a charge that Hesai has challenged.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Hesai told reporters it was able to double the production target because of “accelerating demand” in the automotive and robotics industries.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s automotive efforts have been buoyed by the Chinese car market’s adoption of lidar sensors, which Hesai said is now in 25% of new electric cars sold in the country. It also claimed that many new vehicles in China are expected to integrate between three to six lidar sensors per car, “significantly expanding Hesai’s addressable market.” Hesai boasts 24 automotive customers, including a “top European” automaker, and said it has 4 million orders for its newest ATX lidar sensor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Automotive has proved to be a fickle market for lidar sensors outside of China. That was one of the contributing factors to Luminar’s downfall, according to the company’s own bankruptcy filings. While Luminar secured deals to integrate its lidar sensors on Volvo, Polestar, and Mercedes-Benz vehicles, those plans fell apart. Volvo had at one point agreed to buy <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/how-luminars-doomed-volvo-deal-helped-drag-the-company-into-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1.1 million lidar sensors from Luminar</a>, but delays to its new vehicle programs and cost overruns caused the Swedish automaker to back out of the deal. (Volvo ultimately only purchased around 10,000 sensors from Luminar.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Robotics is not guaranteed to be a successful market for lidar sensors, but some players besides Hesai see great promise. San Francisco-based Ouster, which acquired rival player Velodyne in 2023 as the lidar industry began to consolidate, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827801-ouster-taking-profits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">has said it believes</a> robotics represents a $14 billion market opportunity. This includes not just humanoid robotics, but last-mile delivery robots and military applications.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, Hesai is showcasing a robotic lawnmower and a robotic dog that use the company’s JT series lidar sensor. The company also hinted at its inclusion in humanoid robots as well. It has struck deals to provide lidar sensors to autonomous vehicle companies like Pony AI, Motional, WeRide, and Baidu.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Hesai also boasted it has helped drive down the cost of lidar sensors by 99.5% in just eight years. That, too, was a contributing factor to Luminar’s downfall; “pressure to reduce costs due to lower price points of China-based competitors” has been regularly listed in the company’s bankruptcy filings as the second-most important factor that explains why the U.S. company found it so hard to build up a self-sustaining business.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This will be the first vehicle to come with Amazon’s next-generation voice assistant, the companies announced during the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The launch is one part of Amazon’s effort to bring its LLM-powered voice and digital assistant to every device — whether handheld or in the driver’s seat — touched by consumers. Alexa+ is already in more than 600 million devices. And automotive is next on the list.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Bringing a custom version of Alexa+ into the BMW iX3 will be an important test for Amazon. Automakers have struggled for years to bring a voice assistant inside vehicles that can handle complex functions and requests that don’t end with the driver yelling in frustration. Efforts to develop natural language processing — a form of AI that lets computers understand and respond to human speech — have been in the works for more than a decade. And while progress has been made, these systems can still be easily stumped by humans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BMW and Amazon’s Alexa+ partnership has been three years in the making.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">BMW announced in 2022 that Amazon Alexa would be the foundation of its <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/28/bmw-will-use-amazon-alexa-to-build-its-next-voice-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">next-generation voice assistant</a>. This meant BMW wouldn’t just <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/27/bmw-to-bring-alexa-to-its-cars-starting-in-2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">embed Alexa</a> into its vehicles but would also use Amazon’s technology platform known as Alexa Custom Assistant to build its own custom version. That timeline was extended as Amazon worked on an automotive version of Alexa+, an overhauled voice assistant developed and powered by large language models that promises to deliver seamless and natural conversations, like talking to a human.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ was built using Amazon Bedrock, a service that lets AWS customers build apps using generative AI models from Amazon and other third-party partners. Customers, like BMW, can then customize the app with their proprietary data.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\" id=\"speakable-summary\">The end result, according to Amazon, is a voice assistant that can break down complex requests, reason through steps, and take actions across different services. For instance, Amazon says users can start a conversation with their Alexa+-enabled Echo speaker in the home and continue it in their BMW. Once in the car, the user can make requests through the Alexa+ assistant that might normally require opening up different apps, like music, navigation, and a home security system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

That’s more than Lucid built at its Casa Grande, Arizona factory in the first half of the year. Lucid also said it delivered — meaning sold — 15,841 vehicles across the whole year, a 55% increase over 2024’s figures.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stronger finish to 2025 sets Lucid up for an all-important year that will see the company start building the first vehicle on its new mid-sized EV platform. The company has said this first vehicle will cost around $50,000, putting it near the same part of the market as the Tesla Model Y and Rivian’s upcoming R2 SUV.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The numbers still pale in comparison to the projections Lucid Motors threw around when it went public in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/21/lucid-motors-2024-guidance-2023-results-gravity-suv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a $4 billion reverse merger in 2021</a>.

The company particularly struggled in early 2025 as it started to ramp up production of the Gravity SUV. It has since been dealing with a number of quality issues on the vehicle, to the level that interim CEO Marc Winterhoff sent an email to customers in December saying that he <a href=\"https://lucidowners.com/threads/email-from-marc-lucid-this-morning.14420/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">shared</a> in their “frustration.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Lingering software problems have unfortunately affected our customers’ experience and satisfaction.

Fire TV customers today can access TV and movies via purchases, rentals, and streaming services, but also have apps for viewing short-form content on the TV, access to numerous live TV streams, premium content, podcasts, music, games, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fire-tv-s-simpler-design\">Fire TV’s simpler design</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“As we brought that content forward, the [user interface] got a little cluttered — a lot of stuff and a lot of rows,” explained Fire TV VP Aidan Marcuss in an interview with TechCrunch. “We know the data — there’s a lot of time spent searching,” he added. “We…know that it could just be easier.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new user interface features several design changes, including rounded corners, varied gradients, consistent typography, and increased spacing between content to make the interface feel less cluttered. While you can still scroll down to see your favorite rows, like what’s up next, you can also see your apps in an expanded horizontal row.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079585\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png 2375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=150,97 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=300,193 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=768,495 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=680,438 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1200,773 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1280,825 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=430,277 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=720,464 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=900,580 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=800,515 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=1536,990 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=2048,1319 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=668,430 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=582,375 582w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=958,617 958w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=708,456 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/New-Fire-TV-UI-Home-Screen-on-Amazon-Ember-Artline-2.png?resize=50,32 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before, you could only <a href=\"https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D54P00008BsKbqSAF/new-interface\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pin six apps</a> to the Fire TV’s home screen — a common user complaint.

This AI-powered assistant allows users to ask questions in natural language, refine their queries as they chat, ask follow-ups, and use visual context. For instance, you could say, “Tell me more about that one,” when you have a movie or TV show’s square tile selected on screen. You could even ask questions with some nuance, like “find me more movies that have the same look,” or have it help you find photos or art.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa+ will be available as an add-on subscription after it exits its early access phase (which currently requires opting in). The AI service will also be included with a Prime subscription. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Fire TV app, meanwhile, was also updated to offer the classic remote control combined with a new way to discover new content. The idea is that people may want to browse for something to watch on their phones instead of just having one person drive the content discovery and search experience with the remote.</p>\n\n<figure

On Monday, at the start of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/storyline/ces-2026-follow-live-as-nvidia-lego-amd-amazon-and-more-make-their-big-reveals/\">CES 2026 in Las Vegas</a>, the company announced the official launch of a new website, Alexa.com, which is now rolling out to all Alexa+ Early Access customers. The site will allow customers to use Alexa+ online, much as you can do today with other AI chatbots such as ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While Alexa-powered devices, including Amazon’s Echo smart speakers and screens, have a well-established footprint with over 600 million devices sold worldwide, Amazon believes that for its AI assistant to be competitive, it will need to be everywhere — not just in the home, but also on the phone and on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Plus, the expansion could later give anyone a way to interact with Alexa+, even if they don’t have a device in their home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Related to this expansion, Amazon is updating its Alexa mobile app, which will now offer a more “agent-forward” experience. Or, in other words, it’s putting a chatbot-style interface on the app’s homepage, making it seem more like a typical AI chatbot. (While you could chat with Alexa before in the app, the focus is now on the chatting — while the other features take a back seat.)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?w=335\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079554\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg 1320w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=74,150 74w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=148,300 148w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=768,1560 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=335,680 335w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=591,1200 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=630,1280 630w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=212,430 212w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=354,720 354w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=443,900 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=394,800 394w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=756,1536 756w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=1008,2048 1008w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=329,668 329w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=185,375 185w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=304,617 304w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=261,531 261w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_0422.jpg?resize=25,50 25w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Screenshot of the new Alexa app</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the Alexa.com website, customers can use Alexa+ for common tasks — for instance, exploring complex topics, creating content, and making trip itineraries. However, Amazon aims to differentiate its assistant from others by focusing on families and their needs in the home. That includes controlling smart devices, as you already could with the original Alexa, as well as doing things like updating the family’s calendar or to-do list, making dinner reservations, adding grocery items you need to your Amazon Fresh or Whole Foods cart, finding recipes and saving them to a library, or even planning the family movie night with personalized recommendations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">More recently, Amazon has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/23/amazons-ai-assistant-alexa-now-works-with-angi-expedia-square-and-yelp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">integrating more services with Alexa+</a>, including the addition of Angi, Expedia, Square, and Yelp, which will join existing apps like Fodor’s, OpenTable, Suno, Ticketmaster, Thumbtack, and Uber.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Alexa.com website features a navigation sidebar for quicker access to your most-used Alexa features, so you can pick up where you left off on tasks like setting the thermostat, checking your calendar for appointments, reviewing shopping lists, and more. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079552\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_shopping-list.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Amazon aims to convince customers to share their personal documents, emails, and calendar access with Alexa+, so its AI can become a sort of hub to manage the goings-on at home, from kids’ school holidays and soccer schedules to doctor’s appointments and other things families need to remember — like when the dog got its last rabies shot, or what day the neighbor’s backyard BBQ is taking place. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This is an area where Amazon will need to stretch, as it doesn’t have its own productivity suite or the wealth of personal data that rivals like Google already have for their own customers. Instead, Amazon has been relying on tools to forward and upload files to Alexa+ for its AI to keep track of. That, too, will now be a feature available on Alexa.com, and the information you share can be displayed on the Echo Show’s screen, where it can also be managed.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to manage a family’s personal data could be Alexa’s biggest selling point, if it gets it right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Seventy-six percent of what customers are using Alexa+ for no other AI can do,” says Daniel Rausch, VP of Alexa and Echo at Amazon, in an interview with TechCrunch. “And I think that’s a really interesting statistic about Alexa+ for two reasons. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He continues, “One, because customers count on Alexa to do unique things. You know, you can send a photograph of an old family recipe to Alexa and then talk through the recipe as you’re cooking it in your kitchen, substitute ingredients for what you have around the home, and get the job all the way done.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But he notes, another 24% are using Alexa to do things other AIs can do — that could indicate they’re shifting more of their AI usage to Alexa+.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079551\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png 2880w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=150,94 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=300,188 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=768,480 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=680,425 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1200,750 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1280,800 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=430,269 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=720,450 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=900,563 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=800,500 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=1536,960 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=2048,1280 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=668,418 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=600,375 600w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=987,617 987w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=708,443 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Alexa.com_smart-home.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alexa.com will initially only be available to Early Access customers who sign in with their Amazon account. Amazon has been steadily rolling out Early Access since <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/26/amazon-unveils-a-new-and-improved-alexa-alexa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its debut of Alexa+ early last year.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rausch tells us that tens of millions of consumers now have access to Alexa+, and they’re having two to three times more conversations with Alexa+ than they did with the original Alexa assistant. Specifically, they’re shopping three times more with Alexa+ and are using recipes five times more than before, he says. Heavy users of smart home devices also use Alexa+ 50% more for smart home control, compared with the original Alexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, across social media and online forums, there are complaints about Alexa+’s misfires and mistakes. But Rausch believes the complaints are overrepresented online. He says that the number of people opting out of the Alexa+ experience after trying it is in the low single digits, on average, or “effectively … almost none.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ninety-seven percent of Alexa devices support Alexa+, and we see now in adoption from customers that they’re using Alexa across all those many years and many generations of devices,” Rausch adds. “We support all of Alexa’s original capabilities, the tens of thousands of services and devices that Alexa was integrated with already are carried forward to the Alexa+ experience.” </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For instance, you could ask Gemini for something to watch that would be a blend of two people’s tastes, or get help remembering a show or movie where you can’t remember the title, but can describe the plot or name one of the actors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">You could even ask Google something like, “What’s the new hospital drama everyone’s talking about?”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079567\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png 3840w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=2048,1152 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Entertainment-Response.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini can respond to users’ questions through a new visually rich framework that adapts to individual queries, combining text, imagery, video context, and real-time sports updates, as required. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Google sees the potential for the TV’s screen to be used for more than just entertainment; with Gemini, the TV can be used to educate, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At CES, Google showed how this would work. When users ask a question about something they want to learn about, the TV screen can offer a deep dive into the topic. A narrated interactive overview simplifies concepts, and users can ask follow-up questions to learn more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3079571\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png 960w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gemini-Dive-Deeper.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Google</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Gemini will also allow users to query their Google Photos library for specific people or moments.

only your voice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, you’ll be able to tell Gemini things like “the screen is too dim” or “I can’t hear the dialogue,” and Gemini will adjust the relevant settings without you having to leave the movie or TV show you’re watching to dig through menus to find the necessary option. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img
