Brex simplified corporate cards. Ramp automated spend controls. Mercury rebuilt startup banking. But this wave of financial innovation has largely skipped one major part of the economy: nonprofits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://givefront.com/\">Givefront</a>, a YC-backed startup founded by 21-year-old Harvard dropout <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-tengtrakool\">Matt Tengtrakool</a> and UC Berkeley’s <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-sunbury\">Aidan Sunbury</a>, aims to change that. The company is building a financial platform designed specifically for nonprofits, including food banks, animal rescues, non-governmental organizations, churches, and homeowner associations.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits generate <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">roughly 6% of the U.S. GDP and contribute trillions of dollars</a> each year, yet most still rely on outdated financial tools. Givefront believes that modern spend management, compliance, and reporting infrastructure—tailored to nonprofit realities—can unlock significant efficiency gains across the sector.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Before starting Givefront, Tengtrakool experimented with a microloan aggregation startup in Nigeria. He later worked inside several nonprofits while studying computer science and statistics at Harvard, including running a few organizations himself. At one nonprofit, he helped grow donations to nearly $500,000. Tengtrakool says these experiences revealed a clear gap that nonprofits face. They have strict regulatory and reporting requirements but lack the tools that modern businesses take for granted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I’ve always been interested in financial systems, and this work fits naturally with that,” the chief executive told TechCrunch. “While helping run these nonprofits with a few other students, we realized most of them didn’t have adequate financial tools to ensure compliance or protect their tax-exempt status. The tools they relied on were completely out of sync with what’s considered modern in the startup world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool initially built the first version of Givefront to solve those problems internally. What started as tooling for organizations he worked with soon expanded to local nonprofits across the country. Over time, the team narrowed its focus to a unified financial platform built exclusively for registered nonprofit organizations, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://healthysector.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">about 1.9 million of them</a> in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront entered Y Combinator Winter 2024 with a broad vision spanning banking and accounting. The team quickly learned, however, that convincing nonprofits to replace accountants or core banking relationships required a slow and painful sales process, ushering a pivot to cards and spend management.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s much easier to get an organization to switch the card they use than to replace their entire accounting stack,” Tengtrakool said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although Givefront offers features similar to corporate spend platforms like Ramp and Brex, its exclusive focus on nonprofits sets it apart.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Nonprofits operate under constraints most businesses never face. They manage restricted and unrestricted grants, report spending to donors and foundations, track volunteer expenses, and file IRS Form 990 disclosures. Many nonprofits manage dozens of grants at once, each with its own spending and reporting rules.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Legacy nonprofit systems such as Blackbaud, Sage, and MIP still dominate the market, but they often lack real-time spend controls, modern approval workflows, and seamless integrations with the tools nonprofits increasingly depend on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rather than replacing these systems outright, Givefront positions itself as a vertical layer that sits on top of them. The platform integrates with legacy accounting software while adding nonprofit-specific spend controls, receipt capture for audits, grant-based budgeting, and automated reporting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many of the workflows we’re building are deeply specific to how this part of the economy works,” Tengtrakool said. “Our workflows and integrations are a 10x improvement when compared to traditional corporate or spend management tools.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Givefront generates revenue from card interchange and subscriptions tied to its bill pay feature. Over time, Givefront plans to expand revenues by launching adjacent products, including payroll, banking, budgeting, and potentially investment and endowment management.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since launching its cards roughly six months ago, Givefront has onboarded hundreds of organizations and reports more than 200% month-over-month growth in revenue and total payment volume. The company expects to serve about 1,000 nonprofits by the end of the year, with a longer term goal of reaching 5,000 organizations by mid-next year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tengtrakool says the team’s youth, which also includes a 17-year-old founding engineer, has served as both an advantage and a challenge so far. Some nonprofit leaders find the team’s age refreshing, while others hesitate to trust financial infrastructure to such a young group. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Churches and religious organizations have driven the strongest adoption, he says. Many rely on volunteer treasurers instead of full-time finance staff, and Givefront’s automation significantly reduces their operational burden.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company recently closed a $2 million round, led by Script Capital with participation from Y Combinator, C3 Ventures, Phoenix Fund, and angels, including the CEOs of Chariot and Wealthfront. The seed investment will help the company scale distribution, grow its team, and expand its cards and bill pay offerings.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Last week, industry representatives <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/fusion-energy-industry-presses-us-government-billions-support-2025-12-09/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">met with Energy Department officials</a>, urging them to help direct billions of dollars toward fusion projects, and earlier this year, the DOE announced a <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-announces-fusion-science-and-technology-roadmap-accelerate-commercial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new roadmap</a> to guide commercial efforts in the sector, though it didn’t commit any new funds alongside the announcement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG is the parent company of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">Truth Social,</a> the microblogging platform that the president spun up after he was banned from platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook in the wake of the January 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. At <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/trump-launches-his-own-social-media-platform-truth-social/\">launch</a>, the president called it “a rival to the liberal media consortium,” and said he wanted to “fight back against the Big Tech companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG went public last year via a merger with a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/21/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-spacs/\">special-purpose acquisition company</a> (SPAC), a technique used to go public by private companies that want to raise money quickly but aren’t yet mature enough to take the traditional IPO route. In the quarter ended September 30, 2025, TMTG <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/sec.irpass.cc/2660/0001140361-25-040977.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported</a> that it recorded a loss of $54.8 million on revenue of $972,900.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Truth Social and the company’s streaming platform have failed to generate much revenue, but TMTG has nevertheless managed to amass $3.1 billion in assets, largely through its cryptocurrency investments and partnerships.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, formerly a Republican congressman, stated that the company’s acquisition of TAE would “cement America’s global energy dominance for generations.” The companies said they plan to site and begin construction on “the world’s first utility-scale fusion power plant (50 MWe)” next year, and have plans for more fusion plants that are expected to generate between 350 megawatts to 500 megawatts of electricity.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the path forward for fusion power remains uncertain.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Currently, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/13/world-record-fusion-experiment-produced-even-more-energy-than-expected/\">only one experimental device</a> has proven that controlled fusion reactions can generate more power than they consume. Several other companies, including Bill Gates-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/28/nvidia-google-and-bill-gates-help-commonwealth-fusion-systems-raise-863m/\">Commonwealth Fusion Systems</a> and Sam Altman-backed <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/28/helion-raises-425m-to-help-build-a-fusion-reactor-for-microsoft/\">Helion</a>, are <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/01/every-fusion-startup-that-has-raised-over-100m/\">in the race</a> to put fusion power on the grid sometime in the early 2030s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If one or more fusion startups succeed, they could deliver gigawatts of clean, continuous power to the grid using nothing more than hydrogen isotopes filtered from seawater. Inside a fusion reactor, those isotopes are heated and compressed until they turn into a plasma. When particles in the plasma collide, they merge to form a new, heavier atom while releasing tremendous amounts of heat, which can be harvested to generate electricity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TAE has been working on a range of fusion devices since the late 1990s. The company has raised nearly $2 billion in total, including a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/03/google-places-another-fusion-power-bet-on-tae-technologies/\">recent $150 million round</a> from existing investors including Google, Chevron Technology Ventures, and New Enterprise. The company has been valued at about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the years, TAE has struggled to make its various designs work. Its latest effort uses magnetic fields generated by rotating plasma to stabilize the plasma itself. Particle beams bombard the outside of the plasma cloud, helping it to spin.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the meantime, TAE has also created a new division focused on the life sciences. It is selling a version of its particle accelerator as a radiation treatment for cancer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the merger, Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Update 12:05 p.m. ET: Added comments from fusion industry insiders.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The funding comes more than a year after the startup <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/05/indias-etherealx-puts-5m-seed-toward-fully-reusable-launch-vehicles/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">raised a $5 million seed round</a> in August 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TDK Ventures is co-leading the round with Vietnam-based venture capital firm BIG Capital, with Accel also participating, the sources said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding talks follow EtherealX securing $130 million worth of contracts from six customers, the sources told TechCrunch, underscoring early commercial demand for its launch services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Founded in 2022 by Manu J. Nair alongside former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Shubhayu Sardar, who serves as chief operating officer, and aerospace engineer Prashant Sharma, the chief technology officer, EtherealX is aiming to take on SpaceX with a medium-lift launch vehicle called Razor Crest Mk-1. The rocket, designed to be fully reusable, is expected to place up to eight tonnes into low Earth orbit and will also be capable of delivering payloads to geostationary transfer and trans-lunar injection orbits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Bengaluru-based startup says its launch system will offer cost efficiencies to customers while helping to address a global shortage of launch capacity, with a first launch targeted for early 2027.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In an interview with TechCrunch last year, Nair said EtherealX’s rocket could offer launch prices ranging from about $350 to $2,000 per kilogram. By comparison, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 typically charges between $1,600 and $2,000 per kilogram.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“At the price point at which we will enter the market, we’ll comfortably capture 30% to 40% of it,” Nair said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India has emerged as one of the few countries globally with a geographic and regulatory advantage for space launches, offering access to multiple orbital inclinations from a single launch site. Its growing space tech ecosystem is also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/indias-digantara-raises-50m-for-space-based-missile-defence-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">attracting global investors</a> seeking markets that can complement space development in the United States, Europe, and other key regions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">EtherealX has secured 16 acres of land in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, which it plans to make operational early next year. The startup has also been developing key components, including a liquid oxygen (LOX) turbopump assembly for its upper-stage engine, known as Pegasus 2.0, according to a recent LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7404121855927836673/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">post</a> by Nair.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">India is aiming to dramatically expand its footprint in the global commercial space industry, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/india-targets-45-billion-space-economy-driven-by-private-firms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">targeting an 8% to 10% market share</a> over the next decade from less than 2% today, with much of that growth expected to be driven by private startups.

To solve this, leagues and broadcasters are trying to make sports more engaging for fans with different kinds of viewing experiences, stats, and analysis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One way to do this is using volumetric video generation that lets users view the play from various angles, giving an inside-the-video-game experience. The core technology uses numerous cameras to capture the footage in 3D for everyone to look at it from various viewpoints.

This system can reduce the camera requirement from over 100 to as few as 32, helping decrease cost and operational overhead, according to Cui and Khan. The startup aims to keep the hardware cost as minimal as possible for teams and broadcasters and sign multi-year contracts for its platform.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software platform will bring biomechanical data of players and stats for teams and leagues using its own sensor stack, which is similar to the sensors on self-driving cars that capture the scene with depth. It will enable new ways to control the viewing of the play for broadcasters and fans using photorealistic 3D reconstruction technology. For instance, if fans wanted to track only the player with the ball, they could do that. They can also freeze a moment in-game to see different angles for a foul or a critical moment in play.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we work with off-the-shelf cameras, the way we package it with our experience in robotics and ML is what gives us an edge both in terms of platforms and also scaling from small practice enclosures to big soccer and football stadiums,” Cui said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the software side, the platform said it can observe different joints, including finger movements of players, to measure flexion. For instance, in the video above of two people playing football (soccer), the system measures flexion of knees and ankles. This could give coaches more ideas about body positioning and the flexibility of a player, and help them improve.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup has raised a $3.6 million seed round led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from Daybreak Capital, Entrepreneurs First, and Transpose Platform.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Joe Ros, a partner at Entrepreneurs First, noted the fund was surprised by how big a following the founders and their autonomous driving team have at the University of Toronto. He noted investors are often hesitant to invest in sports-related startups, but Peripheral Labs is also an entertainment play.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Their ultimate viewer is the consumer, and their demand for sports content is evergreen, not cyclical. With Peripheral, the new standard for that consumption will be immersive, volumetric video. And the work they’re doing now in sports will give them the data, tech, and deployment moat to be the only person in the market able to enable this,” he told TechCrunch over email.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Peripheral Labs said the startup was selective about the VCs they were bringing in, who could help in different areas like product development and go-to-market advice. The company has 10 engineers on its staff and aims to increase headcount with a focus on platform and hardware development to reduce costs for the company, decrease the latency of the system, and also increase the resolution of 3D reconstruction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The startup hasn’t made any public announcements about the partners it is working with, but said it is in conversation with several teams and leagues in North America. The company competes with other startups like <a href=\"https://arcturus.studio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Arcturus Studios</a> in the volumetric capture for sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These evenings offer a chance to step back from the blur of headlines and hype cycles, to sit with the people actually driving change, and to understand what’s really happening behind the scenes. They’ve been designed from the start as cocktail parties with killer content — we’ve always wanted these to be intimate gatherings where the conversation flows freely, and speakers can let their guard down in ways they simply can’t at larger, more formal conferences.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-full-2025-strictlyvc-recap\">The full 2025 StrictlyVC recap</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Looking back, 2025 was truly a blur of both insights and amazing connections. It’s almost hard to believe now how many stimulating conversations we were able to facilitate — from heads of state to startup founders, from crypto evangelists to defense tech pioneers. And each evening brought its own energy and revelations.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-where-it-started-san-francisco\">Where it started: San Francisco</h3>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We kicked off this past year in San Francisco’s Presidio, where Kirsten Green of Forerunner Ventures co-hosted an unforgettable night. Green herself — an early investor in Chime, Oura, and countless other household brands — shared her excitement about the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/11/forerunners-long-game-as-startups-stall-before-ipo-all-options-are-on-the-table/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">white space</a> emerging at the intersection of AI and consumer tech. But she was just the beginning. We heard from Ethan Thornton of Mach Industries about the wild ride of building a defense tech startup in your twenties, complete with all the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/how-a-hydrogen-explosion-led-a-teenage-founder-to-become-sequoias-first-defense-tech-investment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">missteps</a> that come with the territory. Tarek Mansour of Kalshi captivated the room, explaining in his entertainingly blasé way why regulators <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/kalshi-ceo-state-law-doesnt-really-apply-to-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">don’t keep him up at night</a>, even as CEO of the industry’s hottest prediction market. Ryan Petersen of Flexport had plenty to say about <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/07/flexport-ceo-ryan-petersens-high-stakes-test-amid-tariff-turmoil-you-cant-be-freaking-out/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s tariff plans</a>.

(Rivian says the software will re-engage if a driver uses their turn signal and handles the turn manually.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s an important step forward for the company, which is aiming to make its vehicles capable of full autonomy over the next few years. But it also comes with risk: Rival automakers with similar systems like Tesla and Ford have dealt with multiple crashes and deaths, many related to drivers’ attention straying from the driver assistance systems. Those crashes have led to investigations and lawsuits.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The updated software greatly expands the driver assistance capabilities that were previously available to Rivian owners. Before the update, Rivian’s hands-free driving system only worked on 135,000 miles of highways. Rivian detailed plans at last week’s event to eventually allow its vehicles to drive themselves from “point-to-point,” though that feature will not ship until 2026. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Rivian is developing a new autonomy computer with custom silicon for its R2 SUV (which debuts in 2026) that, combined with a roof-mounted lidar sensor, will be capable of one day making the company’s vehicles fully autonomous, CEO RJ Scaringe said last week. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The software update released Thursday brings a few other features not related to Rivian’s driver assistance system. There’s a new version of its digital key that owners of second-generation R1 vehicles can add to digital wallets on iPhones, Apple Watches, Google Pixels, and Samsung phones. Owners of quad-motor variants of the Gen 2 R1 EVs are also getting the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/08/the-tech-behind-rivians-2026-quad-motor-truck-and-suv-and-that-kick-turn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-teased “Kick Turn” feature</a>, as well as the “RAD Tuner” customizable drive modes.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The iPhone maker is not making these changes because it wants to be more open; it’s being forced — in this case, to comply with the country’s Mobile Software Competition Act (MSCA), which is now going into effect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-distribution-in-japan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">this update</a>, Apple’s App Store revenues are being impacted in another major market due to anticompetition laws and regulations. The company already has to comply with Europe’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which previously required the tech giant to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118110\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">allow for alternative app stores</a> and other changes.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., Apple has been strong-armed into changing its in-payments system <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-just-scored-a-major-win-against-apple/\">by way of the courts</a>, after a lawsuit from Fortnite maker, Epic Games. Though it was not declared a monopoly, the court decided Apple needed to give developers the right to process payments outside of its system if they chose. (The specifics around that order are still being worked out after an appeal <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-appeals-court-partly-reverses-sanctions-against-apple-epic-games-antitrust-2025-12-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">partially reversed an earlier ruling.</a>)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As usual, in its announcement about the changes in Japan, Apple warned that alternative app marketplaces and payments open “new avenues for malware, fraud, scams, and privacy and security risks.” To mitigate those risks, the company said it worked with Japanese regulators to require an authorization process for app marketplaces (“Notarization”), which it says is designed to protect children specifically from inappropriate content and scams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The fact that Apple has come up with a process to dial back the risk for alternative app stores indicates there has always been a technical solution at hand to balance the needs for both openness and security.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As in the EU, Apple has come up with a complex fee structure to ensure it doesn’t lose much in the form of App Store revenue, while seemingly complying with the letter of the law.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3077346\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg 1770w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1200,791 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1280,843 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=430,283 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=720,474 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=900,593 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=800,527 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=1536,1012 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=668,440 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=569,375 569w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=937,617 937w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=708,466 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-18-at-9.48.10-AM.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Apple / screenshot by TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, of course, was not silent on this matter, saying Fortnite will still not return to iOS in Japan because Apple is charging a 21% fee on third-party in-app purchases.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2001494517996732598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In a post on X, he wrote</a>, “Apple was required to open up iOS to competing stores today, and instead of doing so honestly, they have launched another travesty of obstruction and lawbreaking in gross disrespect to the government and people of Japan.

Users can also provide a start and an end frame to guide the model to generate transitional footage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said Thursday the Ray3 Modify model solves the problems of preserving human performance while editing or generating effects using AI for creative studios. The startup said the model follows the input footage better, allowing studios to use human actors for creative or brand footage. Luma mentioned the new model retains the actor’s original motion, timing, eye line, and emotional delivery while transforming the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With Ray3 Modify, users can provide a character reference for transformation to the original footage and convert the human actor’s appearance into that character. This reference also allows creators to retain information like costumes, likeness, and identity across the shoot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s more, users can also provide start and end reference frames to create a video using the new Ray3 Modify model. This is helpful for creators in directing transitions or controlling character movements or behavior while maintaining continuity between scenes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Luma AI - Introducing Ray3 Modify\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s-wRxtSKC0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Generative video models are incredibly expressive but also hard to control. Today, we are excited to introduce Ray3 Modify that blends the real-world with the expressivity of AI while giving full control to creatives. This means creative teams can capture performances with a camera and then immediately modify them to be in any location imaginable, change costumes, or even go back and reshoot the scene with AI, without recreating the physical shoot,” Amit Jain, co-founder and CEO of Luma AI, said in a statement. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Luma said the new model is available to users through the company’s Dream Machine platform. The company, which competes with the likes of Runway and Kling, released <a href=\"https://lumalabs.ai/blog/news/introducing-modify-video?utm_source=alphasignal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">video modification capabilities</a> in June 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The model release comes on the back of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/19/luma-ai-raises-900-million-in-funding-led-by-saudi-ai-firm-humain.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a fresh $900 million funding round</a>, led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund-owned AI company Humain, for the startup announced in November.

The company launched in 2024, and has grown blazing fast: It reached the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/23/eight-months-in-swedish-unicorn-lovable-crosses-the-100m-arr-milestone/\">vaunted $100 million ARR milestone</a> within eight months, and just four months later, doubled that to surpass <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/as-lovable-hits-200m-arr-its-ceo-credits-staying-in-europe-for-its-success/\">$200 million in annual recurring revenue</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company counts major software names like Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk as customers, and claims that more than 100,000 new projects are built on its platform every day, and more than 25 million projects were created in its first year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable said it would use the new funding for building deeper integrations with third-party apps, expanding its features for enterprise use-cases, and to flesh out its platform with the infrastructure needed — like databases, payments, and hosting — to build full-fledged applications and services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lovable co-founder and CEO Anton Osika said onstage at this year’s Slush conference in Helsinki, Finland that he credits the company’s ability to scale to his decision to ignore calls from investors to relocate the company to Silicon Valley.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It was tempting, but I really resisted that,” Osika said onstage at the November conference. “I [can] sit here now and say, ‘Look, guys, you can build a global AI company from this country.’ There is more available talent if you have a strong mission, and you have a lot of urgency coming together as a group and working.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, the company was called out for not paying VAT, a tax that applies to most goods and services in the European Union (EU). Osika confirmed that this was true in a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/antonosika_lovable-just-got-called-out-for-not-paying-activity-7399176055850364928-Yq78/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LinkedIn post</a>, saying that the company would remedy the situation, and shut down comments saying taxes like this are why the EU isn’t a good home for high-growth startups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vibe coding continues to be a hot area of investing for VCs. Cursor, another vibe-coding darling, raised <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/13/coding-assistant-cursor-raises-2-3b-5-months-after-its-previous-round/\">$2.3 billion in November</a> at a $29.3 billion valuation.

For example, if the system sees a person in a delivery uniform dropping off a package, it will respond based on your instructions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature adds settings that let you specify where delivery people can leave packages, and direct them toward water or snacks you might have kept out. If a delivery person needs a signature, Alexa can also ask them when they might return, and pass that message to the user.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It can also handle sales reps or service vendors. You can set an instruction such as “If someone comes to the door trying to sell something, politely let them know we’re not interested.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">And if you’re busy or not home, Alexa can greet friends or family when they visit, and ask them to leave a message for you.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It goes without saying that the tech presents the risk of misidentifying people and responding inappropriately — if, for example, a friend works in logistics and comes to see you after work in their delivery uniform, Ring may, via Alexa, ask them to leave a package somewhere instead of letting them leave a message.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new feature follows a controversial facial recognition feature for Ring called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/09/amazons-ring-rolls-out-controversial-ai-powered-facial-recognition-feature-to-video-doorbells/\">“Familiar Faces”</a> that lets you create a catalog of the faces of up to 50 people who visit you regularly.

Put another way, the agency wants to know why some people are paying substantially more for their organic granola than others.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The issue came to light after a study revealed that shoppers are seeing fairly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/study-shows-instacart-may-be-charging-some-shoppers-20-more-for-the-same-product/\">different prices</a> for identical groceries from the same stores — up to 23% higher prices in some cases. Instacart says these price tests were randomized, not tied to an algorithm that targets customers based on their browsing history. But when people are already anxious about affording eggs, that distinction probably doesn’t mean much.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dynamic pricing isn’t new or necessarily nefarious. Harvard Business School will tell you it’s how digital platforms stay competitive. Airlines use it, hotels use it, Uber famously uses it. Companies argue that it helps balance supply and demand, maximizes profitability, and creates win-win scenarios.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But there’s a difference between paying surge pricing for a ride home from the bar and paying extra for groceries (food isn’t optional). So while the investigation doesn’t prove wrongdoing, it’s hardly shocking that the FTC — which has investigated data-driven <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-ftc-looking-into-targeted-pricing-based-personal-data-2024-07-23/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pricing strategies</a> by other companies — is reportedly asking questions. In an economy where everyone’s feeling squeezed, AI-driven price testing of kitchen essentials was bound to attract attention.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For its part, Instacart says the market misunderstands this particular initiative. “Much of what’s been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,” a spokesperson for the company tells TechCrunch. “First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing — prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.” <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

The software firm has launched a number of different AI services since 2023, including<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/16/adobe-firefly-now-supports-prompt-based-video-editing-adds-more-third-party-models/\"> Firefly</a> — its AI-powered media-generation suite. Now, however, the company’s full-throated embrace of the technology may have led to trouble, as a new lawsuit claims it used pirated books to train one of its AI models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A proposed class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of Elizabeth Lyon, an author from Oregon, claims that Adobe used pirated versions of numerous books — including her own — to train the company’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2411.09944v1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">SlimLM program</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Adobe describes SlimLM as a small language model series that can be “optimized for document assistance tasks on mobile devices.” It<a href=\"https://research.adobe.com/publication/slimlm-an-efficient-small-language-model-for-on-device-document-assistance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> states that</a> SlimLM was pre-trained on SlimPajama-627B, a “deduplicated, multi-corpora, open-source dataset”<a href=\"https://www.cerebras.ai/blog/slimpajama-a-627b-token-cleaned-and-deduplicated-version-of-redpajama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> released by Cerebras</a> in June of 2023. Lyon, who has written a number of guidebooks for non-fiction writing, says that some of her works were included in a pretraining dataset that Adobe had used.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lyon’s lawsuit, which was<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/adobe-sued-allegedly-misusing-authors-work-ai-training-2025-12-17/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> originally reported</a> on by Reuters, says that her writing was included in a processed subset of a manipulated dataset that was the basis of Adobe’s program: “The SlimPajama dataset was created by copying and manipulating the RedPajama dataset (including copying Books3),” the lawsuit says. “Thus, because it is a derivative copy of the RedPajama dataset, SlimPajama contains the Books3 dataset, including the copyrighted works of Plaintiff and the Class members.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Books3” — a huge <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collection of 191,000 books</a> that have been used to train GenAI systems — has been an ongoing source of legal trouble for the tech community. RedPajama has also been cited in a number of litigation cases. In September, <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-faces-lawsuit-over-use-of-pirated-books-to-train-ai-models/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a lawsuit </a>against Apple claimed the company had used copyrighted material to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/apple-sued-over-use-copyrighted-books-train-apple-intelligence-2025-10-10/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">train its Apple Intelligence model</a>. The litigation mentioned the dataset and accused the tech company of copying protected works “without consent and without credit or compensation.” In October, a similar lawsuit against Salesforce<a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/salesforce-used-pirated-books-to-train-9970854/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> also</a> claimed the company had used RedPajama for training purposes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for the tech industry, such lawsuits have, by now, become somewhat commonplace. AI algorithms are trained on massive datasets and, in some cases, those datasets have allegedly included pirated materials. In September, Anthropic<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/09/05/g-s1-87367/anthropic-authors-settlement-pirated-chatbot-training-material\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> agreed to pay $1.5 billion</a> to a number of authors who had sued it and accused it of using pirated versions of their work to train its chatbot, Claude. The case was considered a potential turning point in the ongoing legal battles over copyrighted material in AI training data, of which there are many.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The decision is in response to a recent <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/pro/billboard-charts-add-more-weight-on-demand-streaming-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">change</a> Billboard made to its ranking formula, which continues to add more weight to paid, on-demand streaming compared with ad-supported, free streaming.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Billboard justified its decision to adjust its age-old formula by saying that the change will “better reflect an increase in streaming revenue and changing consumer behaviors.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In other words, streaming now matters more than buying albums or songs, so it wants its charts to reflect that.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, YouTube doesn’t like the new formula because it doesn’t want there to be much — if any — differentiation between free and paid streams, especially if the changes are meant to reflect how consumers today are enjoying music. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Billboard uses an outdated formula that weights subscription-supported streams higher than ad-supported. This doesn’t reflect how fans engage with music today and ignores the massive engagement from fans who don’t have a subscription,” a YouTube blog post published on Wednesday <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-billboard-chart-update/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">explains</a>. “Streaming is the primary way people experience music, <a href=\"https://www.riaa.com/growth-in-paid-subscription-streaming-drives-mid-year-2025-us-recorded-music-revenues-to-new-high-reports-riaa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">making up 84%</a> of U.S. recorded music revenue.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re simply asking that every stream is counted fairly and equally, whether it is subscription-based or ad-supported—because every fan matters and every play should count,” the post notes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ranking changes will be reflected starting with the charts published on January 17, which will include data from January 2-8, 2026. This will impact the Billboard 200 lists and genre-based album charts. In addition, the ratio between paid/subscription and ad-supported on-demand streaming tiers will be adjusted to 2.5:1 for the Billboard Hot 100, Billboard said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">To protest the new formula, YouTube said it will no longer provide data to Billboard after January 16, 2026.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s what that change means in practice: Under the revised calculation, Billboard said it will take 33.3% fewer ad-supported on-demand streams of songs from an album, and 20% fewer paid/subscription on-demand streams of songs from an album, to equal an album unit. In short, it will take fewer streams than before for an album to climb the charts. This is a win for streaming in general but not necessarily for YouTube.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Here’s why. At present, the formula Billboard uses defines an album unit (the standard measurement for chart rankings) as one album sale. It counts 10 individual songs from an album as one album consumption unit, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the streaming side, it currently says an album unit equals 3,750 ad-supported streams — like YouTube’s  — or 1,250 paid/subscription official audio and video streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After the changes, those figures will be adjusted, so it will take 2,500 ad-supported streams or 1,000 paid/subscription streams to count as one album unit. This means paid streams count 2.5x as much as ad-supported streams. While that’s less of a gap than the current 3:1 ratio, it’s still not what YouTube would prefer seeing here. The company is essentially doing what companies do in failed negotiations like this: it’s taking its ball and going home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Of course, by not cooperating with Billboard, YouTube’s music data won’t be considered in chart rankings, which could lead labels and artists to deprioritize publishing their music on YouTube. That’s not a good long-term strategy for YouTube as an important player in the streaming music era. That’s why this move should be viewed as the negotiation tactic it is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are committed to achieving equitable representation across the charts and hopefully can work with Billboard to return to theirs,” YouTube’s announcement concludes. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The move comes as Oscar ratings have steadily fallen from a peak of 55 million viewers in 1998 to closer to 20 million in recent years, prompting the Academy to explore new ways to reach audiences.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We are thrilled to enter into a multifaceted global partnership with YouTube to be the future home of the Oscars and our year-round Academy programming,” said Academy CEO Bill Kramer and Academy President Lynette Howell Taylor in a joint statement. “The Academy is an international organization, and this partnership will allow us to expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible — which will be beneficial for our Academy members and the film community.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As part of the deal, YouTube will not only broadcast the ceremony, but also red carpet coverage, behind-the-scenes content, the Oscar nominations announcement, Academy member and filmmaker interviews, Governors Ball access, film education programs, podcasts, and more. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The Oscars are one of our essential cultural institutions, honoring excellence in storytelling and artistry,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan said in a statement. “Partnering with the Academy to bring this celebration of art and entertainment to viewers all over the world will inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars’ storied legacy.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Although this isn’t the first time a streamer has acquired the rights to an awards show — Netflix <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/11/netflix-gets-live-streaming-rights-to-sag-awards-in-2024/\">has secured</a> rights to the SAG Awards — it’s the first time one of the big four awards shows (Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, and Tonys) will leave broadcast TV entirely in favor of streaming.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The program was part of the company’s metaverse push — the idea behind the program was to create a “<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">new generation of hardware</a>” that would give VR users their pick of devices when it came to engaging with Meta’s digital worlds.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have paused the program to focus on building the world-class first-party hardware and software needed to advance the VR market,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We’re committed to this for the long term and will revisit opportunities for third-party device partnerships as the category evolves.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news was<a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-third-party-headset-cancelled-asus-lenovo/#google_vignette\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> originally reported</a> by Road to VR.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last April, the tech giant<a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> announced that</a> it would be opening up Meta Horizon OS to third-party headset makers. At the time, the company said that Asus, Microsoft’s Xbox, and Lenovo, were all working on creating new hardware that would run the company’s software. “As we’ve seen with the PC and smartphone industries, consumers are best served by a broad hardware ecosystem producing both general-purpose computing devices and more specialized products, all running on a common platform,” the company said at the time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Between the announcement of the partner program and now, there haven’t been a whole lot of updates about it. In September, at the company’s Connect event, a Meta spokesperson<a href=\"https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-horizon-os-asus-lenovo-quest-connect-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> said that</a> Meta was still working with its business partners to push Horizon OS into more devices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Horizon OS was designed to deliver “mixed reality experiences,” and to communicate “social presence” through technologies like hand, body, eye, and face tracking. It launched in the days when Mark Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-lays-out-the-future-of-meta-140009379.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">still maintained that</a> the metaverse was the “future” of his company. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Unfortunately for Horizon and the coders who work on it, Meta and its top executive have seemed less and less interested in the metaverse in recent times, as AI becomes a larger focus for the company. Earlier this month, Bloomberg<a href=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-zuckerberg-plans-deep-cuts-063541372.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> reported that</a> the metaverse group within Reality Labs, Meta’s unit focused on VR and AR hardware, was facing potential budgetary cuts as high as 30%. The company subsequently<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/04/technology/meta-cuts-metaverse-unit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"> confirmed that</a> it was planning on “shifting some of our investment from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables given the momentum there.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">October 13-15, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Worse, there are no patches available at this time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sma-attack-N9bf4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">In a security advisory</a>, Cisco said it discovered a hacking campaign on December 10 targeting Cisco AsyncOS software, and in particular the physical and virtual appliances Cisco Secure Email Gateway, Cisco Secure Email, and Web Manager. The advisory said affected devices have a feature called “Spam Quarantine” enabled and are reachable from the internet. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cisco noted that this feature is not enabled by default and does not need to be exposed to the internet, which may be good news. <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@mttaggart/115735885528149384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Michael Taggart</a>, a senior cybersecurity researcher at UCLA Health Sciences, told TechCrunch that “the requirement of an internet-facing management interface and certain features being enabled will limit the attack surface for this vulnerability.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, <a href=\"https://elk.zone/infosec.exchange/@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social/115736098425798888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Kevin Beaumont</a>, a security researcher who tracks hacking campaigns, told TechCrunch that this appears to be a particularly problematic hacking campaign since a lot of big organizations use the affected products, there are no patches available, and it’s unclear how long the hackers had backdoors in the affected systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At this point Cisco is not saying how many customers are affected.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, Cisco spokesperson Meredith Corley did not answer a series of questions, and instead said that the company “is actively investigating the issue and developing a permanent remediation.”</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this hacking campaign?

Social media strategist Matt Navarra noted that users part of the test can only post two links unless they pay for <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/en-gb/meta-verified\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a Meta Verified subscription</a>, which starts from $14.99 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the screenshot posted by Navarra, users can still post affiliate links, comments, and links to Meta platform posts, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company confirmed the test to TechCrunch and said it impacts those people using <a href=\"https://creators.facebook.com/professional-mode-for-profiles/?locale=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">professional mode</a> and Facebook Pages. Professional mode lets you convert your personal profile into a creator profile while making your content eligible for discovery by a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“This is a limited test to understand whether the ability to publish an increased volume of posts with links adds additional value for Meta Verified subscribers,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This would directly impact creators and brands posting links from their blogs or other platforms to reach a wider audience.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said it is trying to learn how it can add more value to Meta Verified subscribers, and this test is one such experiment to enhance that paid plan. The company added that, at the moment, publishers are not included in this test. It also said that users can still post links in comments, and they are not impacted by the limit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its <a href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/reports/widely-viewed-content-report/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">transparency report for Q3</a>, Meta said that more than 98% views on the feed in the U.S. come from the posts that don’t have any links. It is not clear if this signal pushed the company to experiment with limits on link sharing, however. The company said that the majority of the 1.9% of views of posts with links came from a page they followed. Linked posts shared by friends and groups were minimal.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3076972\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg 738w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=150,79 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=300,158 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=680,358 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=430,227 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=720,380 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=668,352 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=708,373 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/download.jpeg?resize=50,26 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Meta</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The same report noted that YouTube and TikTok, along with GoFundMe, were the top domains amid the links posted.

At AWS’s recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/04/all-the-biggest-news-from-aws-big-tech-show-reinvent-2025/\">re:Invent</a> event, Amazon hammered home its commitment to AI for enterprise use, so it makes sense that the company is spinning out a new team from AWS leadership.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With our Nova 2 models just launched at re:Invent, our custom silicon growing rapidly, and the advantages of optimizing across models, chips, and cloud software and infrastructure, we wanted to free Peter up to focus his energy, invention cycles, and leadership on these new areas,” Jassy wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s increasing emphasis on AI comes at a time when the company is eager to strengthen its foothold in the AI race, perhaps more through investments than its own innovations. Last month, AWS <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/24/aws-is-spending-50b-build-ai-infrastructure-for-the-us-government/\">announced</a> a $50 billion investment in the U.S. government’s AI infrastructure.
