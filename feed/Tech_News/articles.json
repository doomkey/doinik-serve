They have already made public commitments in recent weeks to cover electricity costs by building their own power sources, paying higher rates, or both, part of a broader effort to solve PR problems around data center expansion and win over skeptical communities. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On January 11, Microsoft <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2026/01/13/community-first-ai-infrastructure/\">announced</a> its policy “to ensure that the electricity cost of serving our datacenters is not passed on to residential customers.” January 26, OpenAI <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://openai.com/index/stargate-community/\">committed</a> to “paying its own way on energy, so that our operations don’t increase your energy prices.” On February 11, Anthropic made the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/covering-electricity-price-increases\">same pledge</a> to “cover electricity price increases that consumers face from our data centers.”  Yesterday, Google <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/googles-new-1-9gw-clean-energy-deal-includes-massive-100-hour-battery/\">announced</a> the largest battery project in the world yesterday to support a data center in Minnesota.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What these commitments means in practice, and who will determine which data centers are responsible for which price increases, remains unknown. The White House has not released the text of the proposed pledge. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“A handshake agreement with Big Tech over data center costs isn’t good enough,” Arizona Democratic Senator Mark Kelly <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/CaptMarkKelly/status/2026493677187538983\">said</a> on social media. “Americans need a guarantee that energy prices won’t soar and communities have a say.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">White House spokesperson Taylor Rodgers <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/TaylorRogers47\">said</a> that next week, companies will send representatives to formally sign the pledge at the White House. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle and OpenAI are reportedly among those set to attend. However none of the companies have confirmed their attendance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even if tech companies committ to taking on electricity costs, on-site power plants may not be a panacea—they can still have adverse impacts on the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/18/xai-is-facing-a-lawsuit-for-operating-over-400-mw-of-gas-turbines-without-permits/\">surrounding environment</a>, and will stress supply chains for natural gas, turbines, photovoltaics and batteries, depending on how companies aim to power their compute.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Some of these have <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/11/cisa-election-security-officials-placed-on-leave-report/\">included several members of its election security team</a>, TechCrunch reported last year.

Others singled out CISA’s acting director, Madhu Gottumukkala, as having struggled to lead the agency and reportedly caused <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/28/trumps-acting-cybersecurity-chief-uploaded-sensitive-government-docs-to-chatgpt/\">security headaches</a> as a result.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CISA has been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/09/senator-puts-hold-on-trumps-nominee-for-cisa-director-citing-telco-security-cover-up/\">without a permanent director</a> since Trump entered office in 2025.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The cybersecurity agency is said to be currently operating <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-navigates-dhs-shutdown-with-reduced-staff/\">at around 38% staff levels</a> as the partial U.S. federal government shutdown, which began on February 14, drags on.

Intrinsic will remain a distinct entity within Google but will work closely with Google DeepMind and will tap into Google’s Gemini AI models and cloud services.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet declined to share information regarding funding or purchase price.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Intrinsic “graduated” into an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/23/alphabets-intrinsic-aims-to-make-industrial-robots-more-capable/\">independent Alphabet-owned company in 2021</a> after five years of development within Alphabet’s X, the company’s moonshot research division. Other companies that have graduated from X include robotaxi company Waymo and drone delivery company Wing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wendy Tan White has served as Intrinsic’s CEO since its spinout in 2021.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company hit the ground running. A few months after announcing its independence, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/alphabet-owned-intrinsic-is-acquiring-fellow-robotic-software-firm-vicarious/\">Intrinsic acquired Vicarious</a>, a fellow robotics software company, in April 2022.

The social media giant says the awards show, called “The Snappys,” is designed to celebrate “the creators shaping culture on Snapchat.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Creators will receive awards like “Spotlight MVP,” “Best Storyteller,” and “Breakout Creator of the Year,” alongside awards across fashion, beauty, sports, music, food, and games. Additional categories include collaboration, comedy, and cultural impact.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Together, these honors reflect the many ways creators spark conversations, build community, and define culture on Snapchat,” the company wrote in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.snap.com/first-ever-snappys-awards\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “The Snappys reinforces Snapchat’s ongoing commitment to celebrating creators not just as users, but as artists, entertainers, and cultural leaders.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat is the latest social media platform to launch awards for creators. Meta-owned Instagram <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/06/instagram-introduces-new-ring-award-for-top-creators/\">introduced a new “Ring” award</a> last October to recognize creators around the world. Instagram announced the 25 winners online, and each winner received a physical custom ring designed by English fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner, along with a digital golden ring around their Instagram profile.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In November, TikTok launched its first-ever <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/tiktok-announces-its-first-awards-show-in-the-us/\">TikTok Awards show</a> in the U.S. Like Snapchat, Instagram handed out category-specific awards, like “Creator of the Year,” “Video of the Year,” “Muse of the Year,” “Breakthrough Artist of the Year,” and more. It’s worth noting that TikTok has also hosted awards shows in other countries, including Germany, Mexico, and Korea.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Snapchat’s awards are more in line with TikTok’s, as it will also host a traditional awards show where the winners will be revealed live at the event. The company says the show will bring together “creators, industry leaders, and special guests.” One of the “special guests” is DJ Khaled, who will be receiving Snapchat’s “Lifetime Achievement Award.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By launching awards, Snapchat and its rivals are positioning themselves as more than just social media apps and as notable players in the entertainment industry. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Snappys will be hosted by comedian and creator Matt Friend and will take place at Snap‘s Santa Monica headquarters.

Even now that the case is over, there are still unanswered questions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Williams, a 39-year-old Australian citizen who resided in Washington, D.C., was the general manager of Trenchant, the division of L3Harris that develops hacking and surveillance tools for the U.S. government and its closest global intelligence partners. Prosecutors say <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/03/how-an-ex-l3-harris-trenchant-boss-stole-and-sold-cyber-exploits-to-russia/\">Williams took advantage of having “full access” to the company’s secure networks</a> to download the hacking tools onto a portable hard drive, and later to his computer. Williams contacted Operation Zero under a pseudonym though, so it’s unclear if Operation Zero ever knew Williams’ real identity.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Trenchant is a crew of hackers and bug hunters who dig deep into other popular software made by companies like Google and Apple, identify flaws in those millions of lines of code, then devise techniques to turn those flaws into workable exploits that can be used to reliably hack into those products. These tools are typically called <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day\">zero-day</a> exploits because they take advantage of software flaws unknown to its developer, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/price-of-zero-day-exploits-rises-as-companies-harden-products-against-hackers/\">can be worth millions of dollars</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">U.S. Department of Justice alleged</a> that the hacking tools Williams sold could have allowed whoever used them to “potentially access millions of computers and devices around the world.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For the past few months, I have been talking to sources and reporting on Williams’ story before news broke that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">he had been arrested</a>. But what I had heard was patchwork and at times conflicting. I had heard someone had been arrested, but given the secret nature of the work involved in exploit development, proving it would be challenging.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4><p>\n\t\t\tDo you have more information about this case, and the alleged leak of Trenchant hacking tools? From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram, Keybase and Wire @lorenzofb, or </p><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">by email</a><a href=\"mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/\">.</a> \t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of Williams, I wasn’t clear that I had even gotten his name right. At that point, his story was a rumor, moving through the hush-hush grapevine of zero-day exploit developers, sellers, and people with ties to the intelligence community. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">I heard that maybe he was called John, or perhaps Duggan? Or all the different ways you can spell that in English. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Some of the first rumors I heard were contradictory. Apparently he stole zero-days from Trenchant, and maybe he sold them to Russia, or perhaps another enemy of the United States and its allies, like North Korea or China? </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It took weeks just to confirm that there was indeed someone who even fit that description. (It turned out that Williams’ middle name is John, and Doogie is his nickname in hacker circles.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then, as the weeks of reporting rolled on, things started to become much clearer. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-russian-connection\">The Russian connection</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/apple-alerts-exploit-developer-that-his-iphone-was-targeted-with-government-spyware/\">I first revealed in October</a>, Trenchant fired an employee after Williams, who was still at the time head of Trenchant, accused the employee of stealing and leaking Chrome zero-days. The story was even more intriguing because the employee told me that after he was fired, Apple notified him that someone had targeted his personal iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What I learned was just the tip of the iceberg. I had heard more from my sources, but we were still piecing parts of the story together. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon after, prosecutors made their first formal accusation against a man named Peter Williams for stealing trade secrets, which first surfaced in the U.S. public court system. In that first court document, prosecutors confirmed that the buyer of these trade secrets was a buyer in Russia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, there was no explicit reference to L3Harris nor Trenchant, nor the fact that the trade secrets that Williams stole were zero-days. Crucially, we still couldn’t confirm for certain that it was the same Peter Williams, who we thought would have access to highly sensitive exploits as Trenchant’s boss, and not some terrible case of mistaken identity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We <em>still</em> weren’t there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On a hunch and with nothing to lose, we contacted the Department of Justice to ask if they would confirm that the person in the document was in fact Peter Williams, the former boss of L3Harris Trenchant. A spokesperson confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Finally, <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/10/23/u-s-government-accuses-former-l3harris-cyber-boss-of-stealing-trade-secrets/\">the story was out</a>. A week later, Williams pleaded guilty. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I first heard of his story, while I trusted my sources, I remained skeptical. Why would someone like Williams do what the rumors claimed? But he did, and did so for money, prosecutors allege, which Williams then used to buy a house, jewelry, and luxury watches. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It was a remarkable fall from grace for Williams, once seen as an accomplished and brilliant hacker, and especially for someone who previously worked at Australia’s top foreign spy agency and served in the country’s military. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096876\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg 4435w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=925,617 925w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/l3harris-logo-canada.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">the L3Harris building in Burlington, Canada</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>JHVEPhoto / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-happened-to-the-stolen-exploits\">What happened to the stolen exploits?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We still don’t know specifically which exploits and hacking tools Williams stole and sold. Trenchant estimated a loss of $35 million, per court documents. But Williams’ lawyers said the stolen tools were not classified as a government secret.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We can glean some insight based on the circumstances of the case. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given that the Justice Department said the stolen tools could be used to hack “millions of computers and devices,” it’s likely the tools refer to zero-days in popular consumer software, such as Android devices, Apple’s iPhones and iPads, and web browsers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is some evidence pointing in their direction. During a hearing last year, prosecutors read out loud <a href=\"https://x.com/opzero_en/status/1706762507631677760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a post published on X</a> by Operation Zero, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/peter-williams-trenchant-trade-secrets-theft-russian-firm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to independent cybersecurity reporter Kim Zetter</a>, who attended the hearing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Due to high demand on the market, we’re increasing payouts for top-tier mobile exploits,” read the post, which specifically mentioned Android and iOS. “As always, the end user is a non-NATO country.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\">offers millions of dollars</a> for details of security vulnerabilities in Android devices and iPhones, messaging apps <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\">like Telegram</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">other kinds of software</a>, such as Microsoft Windows, and hardware vendors, such as several brands of servers and routers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/#:~:text=Baseband-,OUR%20CLIENTS,-Our%20clients%20are\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> to work with the Russian government. At the time Williams sold the exploits to the Russian broker, Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine was already underway.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the same day that Williams was sentenced, the U.S. Treasury <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/treasury-sanctions-russian-zero-day-broker-accused-of-buying-exploits-stolen-from-u-s-defense-contractor/\">announced it had imposed sanctions</a> against Operation Zero and its founder Sergey Zelenyuk, calling the company a national security threat. This was the government’s first confirmation that Williams had sold the exploits to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In its statement, the Treasury said the broker “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” At this point we don’t know who this user is. The user could be a foreign intelligence service, or it could be a ransomware gang, given that the Treasury also sanctioned Oleg Vyacheslavovich Kucherov, an alleged member of the Trickbot gang, who also allegedly worked with Operation Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a court document, prosecutors said that L3Harris was able to figure out that “an unauthorized vendor was selling a component” of one of the stolen trade secrets “by comparing company-specific vendor data found on a stolen component that matched.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Prosecutors also said that Williams “recognized code he wrote and sold” to Operation Zero “being utilized by a South Korean broker,” further suggesting that both L3Harris and prosecutors know which tools were stolen and sold to Operation Zero. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Another unanswered question is: Did anyone, either the U.S. government or L3Harris, alert Apple, Google, or whichever tech company’s products were affected by the zero-day flaws, now that the exploits had leaked?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Any company or developer would want to know that someone could have used (or could still use) a zero-day against their users and customers so that they can patch the flaws as soon as possible. And at this point, the zero-days are of no use for L3Harris and its government customers.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When I asked Apple and Google, neither company responded to my inquiries. L3Harris did not respond either. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-who-hacked-the-scapegoat-and-why\">Who hacked the scapegoat, and why?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Then there’s the mystery of the scapegoat, who was fired after Williams accused him of stealing and leaking code.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At sentencing, Justice Department prosecutors <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/11/doj-says-trenchant-boss-sold-exploits-to-russian-broker-capable-of-accessing-millions-of-computers-and-devices/\">confirmed</a> that the employee was fired, saying Williams “stood idly by while another employee of the company was essentially blamed for [his] own conduct.” In response, Williams’ attorney rebuffed prosecutors, claiming that the former employee “was fired for misconduct,” citing claims of dual-employment and improper handling of the company’s intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to a court document submitted by Williams’ lawyers, as part of the L3Harris internal investigation, the company placed the employee on leave, seized his devices, transferred them to the U.S., and “offered them to the FBI.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached for comment, an unnamed FBI spokesperson said the bureau had nothing to add apart from the Justice Department’s <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-general-manager-us-defense-contractor-sentenced-87-months-selling-stolen-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">press release</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">After being fired, that employee, whom we identified with the alias Jay Gibson, received a notification from Apple that his personal iPhone was targeted “with a mercenary spyware attack.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/10/apple-warning-mercenary-spyware-attacks/\">sends</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/30/apple-notifies-new-victims-of-spyware-attacks-across-the-world/\">these</a> <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/22/apple-alerted-iranians-to-iphone-spyware-attacks-say-researchers/\">notifications</a> to users it thinks were the target of attacks using tools like those made by NSO Group or Intellexa.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Who tried to hack Gibson? He received the notification on March 5, 2025, more than six months after the FBI investigation had begun. The FBI “regularly interacted with [Williams] in late 2024 through the summer of 2025,” <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26950140-usa-v-williams-24-doj-sentencing-memo/?q=october&amp;mode=document#document/p5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">according to a court document</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Given the nature of the leaked tools, it is plausible that the FBI, or perhaps even a U.S. intelligence agency, targeted Gibson as part of the investigation into Williams’ leaks. But we just don’t know, and there’s a chance that neither the public, nor Gibson, will ever find out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated to clarify 22nd paragraph attributing the tools’ lack of classification to Williams’ lawyers.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The updated ring comes equipped with a number of features, including an AI “agent coach” designed to keep users on track to attain their fitness goals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS says it differentiates itself from other wearables by not just delivering health metrics but also incentivizing healthy behavior through a points system. Users garner digital “health points” for healthy behaviors — things like daily sleep, 10,000 steps every day, sports activities, and conversations with the ring’s AI coach — which can then be redeemed through an integrated marketplace for discounts on health supplements and other products.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring’s AI Agent Coach, meanwhile, is designed to leverage generative AI to aid with healthy programs for exercise and daily health. The company says that its agent generates tailored programs including “daily tasks, recovery protocols, supplement recommendations, and direct referrals to licensed medical professionals.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ring also tracks a host of body metrics and daily behaviors, such as sleep quality, stress management, movement, and recovery. This helps them see how these metrics affect their Pace of Aging (PoA), showing whether their body is aging faster or slower than their chronological age, the company explains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS CEO and co-founder Edison Chen told TechCrunch that since his company’s first wearable was launched in 2024, the company has sold over 30,000 units across its first two models. The app’s user base has also grown to 250,000 users across 103 countries, he added.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our strongest markets so far have been North America, Europe, and Asia,” Chen said. “What we’re good at is pattern recognition for healthy people trying to optimize,” Chen told TechCrunch. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The AI spots when you’re trending in the wrong direction, such as chronic poor sleep, declining HRV, elevated resting heart rate, and either suggests lifestyle changes or connects you to a professional. The control is in the escalation pathway to the right care access,” he said.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company claims that it keeps user data encrypted and secure via the Solana blockchain. It has previously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://shop.cudis.xyz/blogs/news/smarter-rings-and-things-7-ways-to-wear-ai\">been described</a> as a “web3 AI wellness company.” (TechCrunch was not able to test the smart ring directly to verify its security claims.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">CUDIS announced $5 million of seed funding in 2024. The round was led by Draper Associates and included a number of other investors, including a number of blockchain-associated investor groups like Skybridge, DraperDragon, Monke Ventures, and Foresight Ventures, among others. The company also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cudis/cudis-sporty-ring-1st-smart-ring-you-can-style-and-earn-with\">plans to launch</a> a Kickstarter soon.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Kalshi users can also trade on when MrBeast will get married, or when his company, Beast Industries, will <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/could-mrbeast-ipo-his-ceo-wants-fans-to-have-a-chance-to-be-owners-of-the-company/\">announce an IPO</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A Beast Industries spokesperson told TechCrunch that the company does not tolerate this behavior, and that this stance extends to company employees, as well as contestants on MrBeast’s Amazon Prime show “Beast Games.” Contestants are also made aware that their knowledge of confidential information precludes them from participating in related prediction markets. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“With regard to this particular matter, we’ve already initiated an independent investigation as part of our overall ongoing efforts to ensure the integrity of our workplace and trust with our global audiences,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We welcome Kalshi — and hopefully others in the space — also taking this issue seriously, but it only works if they are willing to communicate their findings, so we’re hopeful they’ll be more open to that in the future.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi says that Kaptur traded around $4,000 on YouTube streaming markets in August and September 2025. He made a $5,397.58 profit, prompting Kalshi to fine him for that amount, plus a $15,000 penalty. Kalshi also banned Kaptur for two years. The company said in its blog post that it will donate the fine to a consumer education non-profit.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi also fined <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://kalshi-public-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/regulatory/notices/Notice%20of%20Disciplinary%20Action%20(2.25.2026)%20(2).pdf\">Kyle Langford</a>, a candidate for political office in California, who traded about $200 on his own candidacy, then posted about it on social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The markets on platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are so vast that it’s challenging to ensure that the users trading on them are not using private knowledge to their advantage, which is against the rules. When it comes to securities like stocks, similar behavior is punishable by up to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/25743/000138713113000737/ex14_02.htm\">20 years</a> in federal prison.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The potential for these markets to be manipulated has drawn attention among U.S. lawmakers.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Last month, one Polymarket user suspiciously <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667232/polymarket-maduro-bet-insider-trading\">bet $32,000</a> that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro would be removed from power by the end of January — just hours later, the U.S. military captured Maduro, earning that user a $400,000 payout.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response, Representative Ritchie Torres (D-NY) proposed <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://ritchietorres.house.gov/posts/in-response-to-suspicious-polymarket-trade-preceding-maduro-operation-rep-ritchie-torres-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-insider-trading-on-prediction-markets\">legislation</a> that would make it illegal for government employees to trade on prediction markets related to government policy, government actions, or political outcomes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mansourtarek_insider-trading-is-banned-on-kalshi-and-activity-7414691318947532800-ZPk9/?rcm=ACoAAAfCS4oBBsd-zF23gA1uc0N8O093XF2k324&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;utm_source=share\">said in a Linkedin post</a> last month that he supports the bill, since Kalshi already adheres to the rules it would enforce.

Anger has grown so loud that it’s begun to shift legislative agendas. Some states and communities are mulling temporary bans on new data center development altogether. Earlier this month, New York joined the club, with a bold new proposal to halt the local cloud build-out in its tracks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S9144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A n</a><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2025/S9144\">ew bill</a> in New York State would impose a three-year moratorium on the issuance of new permits for data center construction throughout the state, while local regulators are given a chance to study the environmental and economic impacts the industry is having on communities. The bill’s co-authors, state senator Liz Krueger and Assemblymember Anna Kelles, have called the legislation the “<a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/ny-data-center-moratorium\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">strongest</a>” introduced in the country.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While no statewide moratoriums have passed so far, local bans are proliferating fast. Several weeks before Krueger and Kelles introduced their bill, the New Orleans City Council <a href=\"https://www.wwno.org/economy/2026-01-29/new-orleans-city-council-bans-data-center-development-for-a-year-heres-why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passed a moratorium</a>, pausing all new data center construction in the city for one year. In early January, Madison, Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://www.cityofmadison.com/council/district3/blog/2026-01-11/proposal-to-establish-a-temporary-moratorium-on-new-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">passed a similar law</a> after protests erupted over regional tech projects. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar policies have also passed in droves of communities throughout construction hot spots like <a href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://bridgemi.com/michigan-environment-watch/at-least-19-michigan-towns-pause-data-centers-no-one-knows-if-itll-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Michigan</a>, as well as in many other regions throughout the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122023/virginia-environmentalists-protest-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Environmental activists</a> have long taken aim at data centers, but the more recent concerns have come from high-level lawmakers, drawing on populist anger at the tech industry broadly. In conservative Florida, for instance, Gov. Ron DeSantis recently announced an <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposal-citizen-bill-rights-artificial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">AI “bill of rights”</a> that gives local communities the right to limit new data center construction. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In liberal Vermont, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2026/01/07/congress/democrats-reject-bernie-sanders-data-center-pause-00713664\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested a nationwide moratorium</a>. And in Arizona, where the political milieu is <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-do-we-need-to-know-about-the-swing-state-of-arizona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">decidedly mixed</a>, Gov.

Politicians have even begun to fight over the topics, with the governor of Mississippi <a href=\"https://x.com/tatereeves/status/2026309465901859025?s=61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">taking shots</a> at Sanders online over his moratorium proposal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The political resistance is coming just as tech companies commit more and more money to building out infrastructure. The four biggest spenders — Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft — plan to spend <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a whopping $650 billion</a> in capital expenditures over the next year, the vast majority of it going to data center build-outs. Even more spending is <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/10/the-billion-dollar-infrastructure-deals-powering-the-ai-boom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">planned in the following years</a>, as the companies race to secure as much compute capacity as possible.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the speed and scale of those projects has made them increasingly unpopular, according to recent polling. <a href=\"https://x.com/PeterHamby/status/2026122722779238770?s=20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A recent Echelon Insights poll</a> found 46% of respondents would oppose plans to build a data center in their community, compared with 35% in support. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/06/tech-industry-ai-data-centers-politics-00762348?utm_source=firefox-newtab-en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">A different poll</a> from Politico found that, while there is considerable concern about the facilities, many voters don’t have much of an opinion either way — making it possible for public sentiment to be swayed in either direction.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The industry is already spending big to attempt to change those numbers — at least in the regions where it matters. In January, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f45d45fc-c0ea-463c-8edf-38fb99ed5c05\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reported that</a> some of the industry’s biggest data center operators were planning a “lobbying blitz,” with plans to “boost spending on targeted advertising and engagement” aimed at the communities where they build.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tech companies are also making real concessions, like <a href=\"https://x.com/andrewcurran_/status/2026720928093319354?s=46&amp;t=45_xAnRsdQP1GVqYv9Gdbw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the planned Rate Payer Protection Pledge</a> that would make them responsible for supplying power to any new AI data centers. But it’s not clear those measures will be enough to bring the public around.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Dan Diorio, of the Data Center Coalition, argued, in a conversation with TechCrunch, that data centers should appeal to smaller communities because they provide revenue without straining those communities’ limited resources. If the incentives are cut off and companies decide not to build in those places, the revenue also won’t be there. “That’s where statewide policy considerations come in,” he said. “Are you going to limit communities in which these businesses could be a significant benefit for them?” </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-logic-behind-pressing-pause\">The logic behind pressing pause </h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In general, data center moratoriums are meant to give communities breathing room while policymakers study the potential costs and benefits of allowing such facilities to be built in their communities. The <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial-builders-are-losing-their-appetite-to-build-anything-but-data-centers-945c594f?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdlypBXrI_34rqvisxw0GblBV3dyNkIpIywQd-BxLwWhC3H_9EEJ1JTaK-o1ec%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6998b29d&amp;gaa_sig=klkOc9jtIRM8Zd9PUsV7FiBwbC23qs6CMGKisf_1m1R6Rwz0PNZL7DnNagJbB3zRRZNbyGTsjGZIsl5eX_GFwA%3D%3D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">rate of construction</a> in some states has accelerated at such a pace that communities are unsure of how the industry will impact them in the long run.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Justin Flagg, director of communications and environmental policy for Sen. Krueger’s office, told TechCrunch that the legislation was driven, in part, by what he called the energy affordability crisis in New York. Said crisis has troubled both rate payers and politicians. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A group of 30 state lawmakers recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqKSTQWtN-I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">called upon</a> the state’s governor, Kathy Hochul, to declare an “energy state of emergency” in New York due to rate increases. While there are <a href=\"https://nysfocus.com/2025/09/18/new-york-energy-bill-hikes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a diversity of factors</a> at work in driving up energy prices, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-ai-data-centers-electricity-prices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">consensus</a> that the growth in data centers is making the problem worse, not better.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s broad discontent being expressed about energy prices,” Flagg said. “We certainly hear that constantly from our constituents, whose electric and gas rates are going up.” He added that local pushback was also being driven by environmental concerns — which he described as the “water impact and the noise and the local infrastructure impact as well.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In response to those grid concerns, major tech companies — including <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/?p=3082319&amp;preview=true&amp;_thumbnail_id=3029459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Microsoft</a>, Google, Meta, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/864798/openai-data-center-opposition-energy-bills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">OpenAI</a> — have promised to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/22/climate/big-tech-warren-electricity-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pay for their additions to the electrical grid</a> in the communities where they operate, often installing behind-the-meter power sources paired with the new data centers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2026/02/19/data-centers-power-grid-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently reported</a> that Silicon Valley is increasingly looking to build its own private electrical supply — a kind of “shadow grid” — that can be used to operate the power-consumptive properties that are now fueling the AI industry. The strategy involves standing up massive new private power sources instead of relying on the public grid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One example of this practice comes from xAI, Elon Musk’s AI startup, which — at the site of its massive data center in Memphis, Tennessee, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/15/xais-colossus-supercomputer-raises-health-questions-in-memphis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">known as “Colossus”</a> — built a series of methane gas turbines that have been accused of polluting the local community. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s efforts have already run into significant trouble. xAI had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2026/jan/15/elon-musk-xai-datacenter-memphis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> told local officials that, due to a legal loophole, the turbines were exempt from air-quality permits. In January, the Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/16/epa-rules-that-xais-natural-gas-generators-were-illegally-used/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ruled that</a> Musk’s company was not exempt from the permits, making their previous operation illegal. Environmental activists, decrying the facility’s discharge of “smog-forming pollution, soot, and hazardous chemicals,” <a href=\"https://www.selc.org/news/xai-built-an-illegal-power-plant-to-power-its-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">announced</a> earlier this month that they planned to sue the company over it. Musk’s facility has since permitted its turbines.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the xAI example illustrates, if the “shadow grid” strategy purports to solve one problem (public grid overload), it threatens to create a host of new ones — with environmental activists and local communities alike <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/datacenter-developers-leverage-natural-gas-to-sidestep-power-grids-short-term-solution-might-increase-carbon-emissions-and-prove-costly-in-the-long-run\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">expressing concern</a> for how the new facilities could spew pollution into people’s backyards.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the federal level, the Trump administration — which has made AI one of its top priorities — has also sought to characterize the industry as responsible stewards of the communities in which they build. Indeed, Trump officials have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/15/navarro-trump-data-centers-affordability.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">floated a hypothetical policy</a> to force AI companies to internalize the costs of their additions to local electrical grids, although the details on this policy remain vague.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-debate-over-taxes\">Debate over taxes</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For years, communities have incentivized data center development through tax breaks. Last summer, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/20/tax-breaks-for-tech-giants-data-centers-mean-less-income-for-states.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">an analysis by CNBC</a> found that 42 states throughout the U.S. either have no sales tax or provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to tech firms. Of that number, some 16 states publicly reported how much they had awarded to companies through tax breaks. The forfeited revenue amounted to some $6 billion over a period of five years, the outlet wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Now, however, more and more states are thinking about turning off the spigot. In Georgia, for instance, <a href=\"https://georgiarecorder.com/2026/01/20/outrage-over-surge-of-data-centers-in-georgia-inspires-wave-of-bipartisan-bills/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a variety of bills were recently introduced</a> that would crack down on the industry’s benefits. State senator Matt Brass, who has introduced a bill that <a href=\"https://www.times-herald.com/news/sen-brass-files-bill-to-end-tax-break-for-future-data-centers/article_191fcf25-113d-42d4-8404-fd68f1f8b925.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">would nix the server sales tax exemption</a>, told TechCrunch that he doesn’t think tech companies need the extra money, nor does he think dispensing with the benefit will dissuade them from doing business in the state. “In Georgia, if you compare us to other states, our property taxes are low, our property values are low, our overall tax burden is low,” Brass said. “So, you know, our overall business climate is good. That should be the attraction.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Brass, who chairs the state’s rules committee, told TechCrunch that he expects there to be significant support for his policy. A similar piece of legislation passed the Georgia legislature in 2024, but it was vetoed by the governor. Brass added that, were the exemption to be done away with, he believes it could generate hundreds of millions of dollars for the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Ohio, a similar policy battle is currently playing out. A group of Democratic lawmakers recently <a href=\"https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2026/02/09/ohio-democrats-offer-slate-of-bills-reining-in-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">introduced legislation</a> that would — like in Georgia — move to nix the state’s sales tax exemption. A similar policy was introduced last year, but — like in Georgia — it was defeated by the state’s governor, Mike DeWine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The most ridiculous tax break on the books currently is for data centers,” one of the bill’s supporting lawmakers, state Sen. Kent Smith, <a href=\"https://www.wowktv.com/news/ohio-lawmakers-consider-repealing-tax-breaks-for-data-centers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently said</a>. “That tax break needs to end, for the benefit of everyone who’s got an electric bill.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, there are still plenty of lawmakers who support the server sales tax exemption. In Colorado, state representative Alex Valdez <a href=\"https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/HB26-1030\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">recently introduced a bill</a> that would enshrine data centers’ loophole for the next 20 years. Valdez told TechCrunch that the exemption is merely a carrot to get tech companies in the door. Once they set up a base of operations in the state, they become a source of passive revenue that inevitably boomerangs back to benefit the communities in which they operate, he said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Operating there successfully would strengthen Waymo’s case that its system is nationally scalable. It also gives Waymo another shot at a northern city after New York <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/19/new-york-driverless-rideshare-nyc-waymo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dropped a proposal</a> that would have allowed commercial robotaxi pilots in parts of the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The news comes the same week Waymo began offering commercial driverless operations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and Orlando, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/waymo-robotaxis-are-now-operating-in-10-us-cities/\">bringing its total city count to 10.</a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aside from Chicago and Charlotte, Waymo is also testing and planning to launch in Denver, London, and Washington, D.C., among other cities.

For starters, the automations can’t be kicked off without an explicit command from the device’s owner. As they run, you can watch their progress in real time and stop the task if it’s making a mistake or getting stuck. Google notes also that the automations take place in a secure, virtual window on your phone where they can only access limited apps, not the rest of the data on your device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature ties into the growing trend of using AI to automate more tasks in users’ personal lives.

The company rolled out ads <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/09/chatgpt-rolls-out-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">to U.S.-based users earlier this month</a> amid criticism from rivals like Anthropic, which published <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/04/sam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads/#:~:text=own%20chatbot%2C%20Claude.-,Another%20commercial,-features%20a%20slight\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">a string of Super Bowl ads</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">On the sidelines of the India AI summit, TechCrunch asked <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/24/openai-coo-says-we-have-not-yet-really-seen-ai-penetrate-enterprise-business-processes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap</a> about how the company is approaching ads. Lightcap said that the process is iterative and the company has to get user privacy and trust right.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Well, this is going to be an iterative process for sure. This is something we are committed to getting right. What does that look like? It means obviously maintaining user trust at a very high level. It means getting privacy right,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He also noted that ads can add to the product experience of users if they are done right. He urged to give OpenAI a few months to see how the company fares in rolling out the product.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It means really creating a delightful product experience. We think ads done right can be additive to a product experience. And so it’ll take iteration, it’ll take time, but we’re just starting out. So maybe give us a few months and see how it goes,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lightcap didn’t specify if the company is thinking about rolling out ads beyond the U.S. market at the moment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Earlier this month, Sam Altman hit back at Anthropic with <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/2019139174339928189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019139174339928189%7Ctwgr%5Ea4b3a014b37f8325129952141c9fb783ac0afcb0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2026%2F02%2F04%2Fsam-altman-got-exceptionally-testy-over-claude-super-bowl-ads%2F\">a long post on X</a> about the Super Bowl ads, calling the OpenAI rival “dishonest” and accusing them of making an expensive product that serves “rich people.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“More importantly, we believe everyone deserves to use AI and are committed to free access, because we believe access creates agency.

From his own experience, the best way to build today is to explore, be playful, and not expect to be an expert at what you do right away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I wish I could say that I had the unified plan in the beginning, but a lot of it was just exploration,” Steinberger said. “I wanted things, and those things didn’t exist, and … let’s say I prompted them into existence.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The developer was chatting with OpenAI’s Head of Developer Experience, Romain Huet, on the first episode of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jgcT0Fqt7U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the company’s new Builders Unscripted podcast</a>. Here, he spoke about what OpenClaw was like in its early days and how he didn’t have a plan when he got started.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Steinberger explained he began by building a tool that would integrate with WhatsApp, but then set it aside for a bit and focused on other things, as he assumed the AI labs would build something like what he was working on in the near future.  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I just experimented a lot. My mission was, kind of like, to have fun and inspire people,” Steinberger noted. By last November, however, the developer was surprised that no AI labs had started to build what he wanted to use. That led him to create the initial prototype of what’s now OpenClaw. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Where it really clicked was where I was at this weekend trip in Marrakesh, and I found myself using it way more because it was so convenient … There was no really good internet. [But] WhatsApp just works everywhere,” he said. The tool made it easy for him to find restaurants, look up things on his computer, send texts to friends, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><p class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"tcembed-iframe tcembed--youtube\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Builders Unscripted: Ep. 1 - Peter Steinberger, Creator of OpenClaw\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jgcT0Fqt7U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>VIDEO</iframe>\n</p></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The more he played with the technology, Steinberger realized how good modern AI models have become at problem-solving, much like coders are. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Now they can just, like, actually come up with the solutions themselves, even though you never programmed them at all,” he noted. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Throughout the process of building, Steinberger said that his workflow improved — and he stresses to other developers that’s something that can take time, so don’t give up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“There’s these people that … write software in the old way, and the old way is going to go away,” he pointed out. They then decide to try vibe coding but are disappointed with the results.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think vibe coding is a slur,” said Steinberger, basically suggesting that it’s not as simple a process at first as the term makes it sound. “They try AI, but they don’t understand that it’s a skill,” he said, then compared the process of coding with AI to learning guitar.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“You’re not going to be good at guitar on the first day,” he said. Instead, he recommends that people approach learning with a more playful attitude. If he writes a prompt now, he has a gut feeling as to how long it will take, and if it takes longer, he reflects on what may have gone wrong and adapts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“My … advice always is, approach it in a playful way. Build something that you always wanted to build. If you’re at least a little bit of a builder, there has to be something on the back of your mind that you want to build. Like, just play.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This ability to experiment and have fun is what’s most important, especially at a time when people are worried their jobs will be overtaken by AI. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If your identity is: I want to create things. I want to solve problems. If you’re high agency, if you’re smart, you will be in more demand than ever,” Steinberger said.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

For the first time this year, podcasts eclipsed spoken-word radio with 40% of listening time, as opposed to 39% for radio.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If anything, it’s surprising that it has taken this long for podcasts to overtake radio shows. (Remember, this doesn’t include listening to music on the radio.) But perhaps that speaks more to the durability of good, old-fashioned radio than the merits of podcasting.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3096431\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=768,513 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=680,454 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=720,481 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=668,446 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=562,375 562w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=708,473 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Spoken_word-Audio-Time-AMFM-podcasts-FINAL.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Edison Research</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">We checked with Edison to see if these statistics include video podcasts, and they do. But the need to clarify that question points to the undeniable growing prevalence of video podcasts, hosted on platforms like Spotify and YouTube, which marks another key trend in podcasting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Perhaps an industry bellwether, Netflix is inking deals with iHeartMedia and Barstool Sports to <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-is-betting-on-podcasts-to-become-the-new-daytime-talk-show/\">bring podcasts to the streaming service</a> as a more trendy version of the daytime talk show. It’s not a bad investment — according to YouTube, people watch them on TV. YouTube said that viewers watched <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcasts-living-room-in-2025/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">700 million hours</a> of podcasts each month in 2025 on living room devices, like TVs, up from 400 million the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the popularity of video podcasts doesn’t seem to be detracting from audio-first podcast listening. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Triton Digital’s <a href=\"https://podnews.net/press-release/triton-podcast-report-us-25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. Podcast Report for 2025</a> showed that 80% of consumers over 18 years of age tune into both audio and video podcasts; 13% only listen to audio, while 7% only watch video. Listener preferences also appear to vary greatly depending on a podcast’s genre, with podcasts about topics like music, sports, comedy, and news skewing more popular on video. Genres like science, history, art, fiction, and true crime are more often consumed via audio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Edison’s findings show a similar trend in the role of video in podcasting. Eighty-five percent of weekly U.S. podcast listeners above the age of 13 consume podcasts with any sort of video component, up 7% from 2023. The research also showed that there are an estimated 115 million weekly podcast listeners in the U.S., with only 5% of listeners reporting that they watch podcasts, but don’t listen to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The European Union has led the charge on this front with laws like the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/20/wtf-is-gdpr/\">GDPR</a>, the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/in-its-first-dsa-penalty-eu-fines-x-e120m-for-deceptive-blue-check-verification-system/\">Digital Services Act</a> and the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/the-eu-ai-act-aims-to-create-a-level-playing-field-for-ai-innovation-heres-what-it-is/\">AI Act</a>, seeking to curb tech companies’ control and exploitation of user data and hold them accountable. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Trump administration has historically opposed such regulatory approaches, and this order reinforces that position as the government seeks to boost U.S. AI companies. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The U.S. State Department did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"
