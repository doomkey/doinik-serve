I decided it was time to make some of my own,” said the two-time NBA MVP <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DUbnCj1krHJ/?igsh=NWVoeXhqemp0czVr\">in a social media post</a>. “Today, I’m joining Kalshi as a shareholder.

The prominent Silicon Valley firm invested at least $225 million in Cerebras’ latest round, according to a person familiar with the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark first bet on 10-year-old Cerebras when it led the startup’s $27 million Series A in 2016. <span>Since Benchmark delibe</span>rately keeps its funds under $450 million, the firm raised two separate vehicles, both called ‘Benchmark Infrastructure,’ according to regulatory filings. According to the person familiar with the deal, these vehicles were created specifically to fund the Cerebras investment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Benchmark declined to comment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What sets Cerebras apart is the sheer physical scale of its processors. The company’s Wafer Scale Engine, its flagship chip announced in 2024, measures approximately 8.5 inches on each side and packs 4 trillion transistors into a single piece of silicon. To put that in perspective, the chip is manufactured from nearly an entire 300-millimeter silicon wafer, the circular discs that serve as the foundation for all semiconductor production. Traditional chips are thumbnail-sized fragments cut from these wafers; Cerebras instead uses almost the whole circle.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">This architecture delivers 900,000 specialized cores working in parallel, allowing the system to process AI calculations without shuffling data between multiple separate chips (a major bottleneck in conventional GPU clusters). The company says the design enables AI inference tasks to run more than 20 times faster than competing systems.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The funding comes as Cerebras, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., gains momentum in the AI infrastructure race. Last month, Cerebras signed a multi-year agreement worth more <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/14/openai-signs-deal-reportedly-worth-10-billion-for-compute-from-cerebras/\">than $10 billion</a> to provide 750 megawatts of computing power to OpenAI. The partnership, which extends through 2028, aims to help OpenAI deliver faster response times for complex AI queries. (OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is also an investor in Cerebras.) </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras claims its systems, built with its proprietary chips designed for AI use, are faster than Nvidia’s chips. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company’s path to going public has been complicated by its relationship with G42, a UAE-based AI firm that accounted for 87% of Cerebras’ revenue as of the first half of 2024. G42’s historical ties to Chinese technology companies triggered a national security review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, bumping back Cerebras’ initial IPO plans and even prompting the outfit to withdraw an earlier filing in early 2025. By late last year, G42 had been removed from Cerebras’ investor list, clearing the way for a fresh IPO attempt.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Cerebras is now preparing for a public debut in the second quarter of 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-ai-chip-firm-cerebras-181107401.html\">according to Reuters</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

This week, amid <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/27/opinion/tech-elite-will-flee-california-over-wealth-seizure-ballot-measure/\">ongoing rancor</a> from tech elites over the much maligned bill, it became apparent that someone was planning a so-called “March for Billionaires” in San Francisco. A <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://marchforbillionaires.org/\">website </a>advertising the event popped up online, providing little in the way of context other than a pithy tagline: “Vilifying billionaires is popular. Losing them is expensive.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The immediate reaction was incredulity, and most people assumed the site was some sort of bizarre hoax. “this is a joke/satire right??” one social media user <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/ArthurCaplan/status/2018066423101161706?s=20\">wrote</a> not long after the news circulated. Now, however, the apparent organizer behind the event has revealed that the march is definitely<em>not</em> a joke, and that it is scheduled to take place this coming Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The San Francisco Examiner <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/technology/sf-billionaires-march-founder-revealed-derik-kauffman/article_1842be47-58a5-430c-b322-dff8910aa98f.html\">first reported</a> that the event’s organizer had been revealed as Derik Kauffman, the founder of AI startup RunRL, which previously participated in Y Combinator’s accelerator program. Kauffman told the Examiner that the event was not being funded or organized by any outside group, no big monied associations or companies—just him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a conversation with TechCrunch, Kauffman — who also told the Examiner that he was no longer involved with RunRL — confirmed that the impetus for the upcoming rally was California’s proposed wealth tax, which the tech founder said he believed would be “quite damaging to the tech economy.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The policy in question, the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/25-0024A1%20%28Billionaire%20Tax%20%29.pdf\">Billionaire Tax Act</a>, was introduced last year, and would require Californians worth over $1 billion to pay a one-time 5% tax on their total wealth. The legislation, which is <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2026-01-19/explaining-californias-billionaire-tax-proposals-backlash-exodus\">backed by the state’s healthcare union SEIU</a> (Service Employees International Union), could pay for important public services and help the state offset recent federal funding cuts, according <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abc7news.com/post/here-is-potential-impact-proposed-california-billionaire-tax-could-have-silicon-valley/18405002/\">to some experts</a>. Nevertheless, the policy has led to loud protestations from some of the tech industry’s most prominent figures, many of whom have either threatened to leave California or <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2026/01/19/california-wealth-tax-exodus/\">have already left</a>. It has also led to a <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/politics/peter-thiel-california-wealth-tax.html\">monsoon of lobbying</a> in the California legislature, in an effort to defeat the bill.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When asked why he opposed the legislation, Kauffman expressed concern for how the bill could impact the startup economy in Silicon Valley. “This tax in particular is fatally flawed,” he said. “It hits startup founders whose wealth is only on paper. They would be forced to liquidate shares on potentially unfavorable terms, incurring capital gains taxes and giving up control. Not to mention the difficulty of valuing private companies.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Many founders would be hit with wildly disproportionate tax bills,” Kauffman continued. “Additionally, there’s no precedent for this sort of comprehensive wealth tax in the US. Sweden eliminated theirs 20 years ago to avert capital flight and promote entrepreneurship and now has 50% more billionaires per capital than the US.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Online conversation about Kauffman’s planned event has continued to alternate between incredulity and ridicule. “I can’t imagine billionaires marching in the street,” one <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://x.com/DianaVGalbraith/status/2018360039069847836?s=20\">social media user said</a>, of the event.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That person would probably be right. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Kauffman told TC that, so far, he isn’t aware of any actual billionaires planning to attend the march that has been organized in their honor. Kauffman said that the event is likely to include “a few dozen attendees,” although he stressed that he really isn’t clear on how many people would show up.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The ongoing outrage over the proposed tax is a little funny, given that it’s already been known for quite some time that the legislation has almost no chance of being enacted. That’s because California Governor Gavin Newsom has already stated that, should the bill somehow pass, he would <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/us/newsom-billionaire-tax-california.html\">veto it</a>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

After a journalist tips her off that something’s wrong with Tender, she sends her associates, Sweetpea and Kwabena, to Ghana to investigate.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What they discover is damning. “Fake users drive fake revenue drives fake cash,” Sweetpea tells Harper. The entire company appears to be built on fabricated numbers. “The thing is nothing.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">What’s fascinating about this season of “Industry” is how well it speaks to this moment. Tender starts as a payment processing platform for adult content. The show references the very real (and still controversial) <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer\">Online Safety Bill </a>that the UK introduced, which has led to age verification and other enhanced rules for consuming adult content online.

Whitney is the embodiment of every tech baron cliche. Move fast, break things. Win at all costs. He’s lobbying politicians for a banking license and hunting for merger opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is leading her newly launched firm after feeling undermined at her previous firm and being called a DEI plant by the man who hired her (a nod to the decline of DEI in the past few years).

Even TechCrunch gets name-checked as part of Tender’s media playbook.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is commentary on fascism via the character Moritz, who lobbies against Western liberalism and is hesitant to sell his family’s bank to Whitney, whose last name is the <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Jewish-sounding Halberstram</a>. The character is perhaps a nod <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2025/jan/29/silicon-valley-rightwing-technofascism\">to the rising “technofacism” criticism</a> of some tech barons.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Harper, meanwhile, is still a calculating sociopath. “My real passion lies with finding dead men walking,” she says at an investor breakfast. She ends up raising millions for her new firm. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She is the one character whose existence strains credibility. Personality-wise, she has to be shrewdly calculating; unlike Yasmin and Henry, she has nothing to fall back on should she fail. But would the UK establishment, which is notoriously insular, exclusionary, and white, really let a Black American woman rise through their ranks and beat them at their own game?</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Who needs realism when she’s such a great character,” one Black British founder told me. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He said the show aptly captures how detached the UK upper class is from consequence and is actually one of the few shows he’s seen that “accurately portrays the ruthlessness of the British elite, specifically how they maneuver the media and governments to suit their own whims.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Nepotism and lack of boundaries at work, people sleeping together for trade secrets, is very realistic and common, unfortunately,” one European investor added. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, Yasmin is headed down a dark path. Earlier this season, she organized a ménage à trois between her husband, Henry, and Whitney’s assistant, Hayley. As the season continues, her behavior becomes so hedonistic that one reviewer has already likened her to <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.vulture.com/article/industry-recap-season-4-episode-3-habseligkeiten-hbo.html\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> — perhaps a perfect emblem of what lies at the pits of money and power, and the role some women play in digging those holes. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090189\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1200,800 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1280,853 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=430,287 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=720,480 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=900,600 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=926,617 926w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=708,472 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ken-leung_1.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>HBO</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">An Icarus moment could be on the way, however, at least for Whitney. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By now, the audience is familiar with how founders in the real world sometimes use deception to overinflate success (like <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/frank-founder-charlie-javice-sentenced-to-7-years-in-prison-for-defrauding-jpmorgan-chase/\">Charlie Javice’s Frank</a>) and allegedly steal from investors and the public (<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/27/ftx-crypto-exchange-collapse-lookback/\">the FTX crypto crash</a>). There are many such infamous cases, and some are even referenced in the show. But perhaps the most relevant real-world parallel for Tender would be the ultimate <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/25/house-of-wirecard-insolvency/\">implosion</a> of the German fintech Wirecard a few years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Wirecard <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wirecards-missing-2-billion-probably-doesnt-exist-board-says-11592802732?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdFGo0Eu63-uBF0k-Zag3EpnzqH6CUrA4LKVvlq30kE-XjJMJYSZdptk8EhN7c%3D&amp;gaa_ts=6984a6fe&amp;gaa_sig=SrQ0eC7J8UdGNNL7DLCf19mXhMLqp8bjFKQ402BEphDywM9sYC8QGa_37ITWv7-Loz6Vxjti7c69jcdjjl4Emg%3D%3D\">admitted that the billions in cash</a> it reported having likely never existed, despite the company’s earlier claims that two banks in the Philippines were holding the funds. It was a tale of complex accounting and legal gray zones — much like the financial fraud depicted in Tender.

Tender’s fate remains unrealized until the last few episodes run. One of the best parts about “Industry” is that it moves fast and breaks things. It is so clearly set in our time and so audacious in its demeanor that the audience is forced to pick their favorite anti-hero and go along for the ride.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a rush, a thrill; the visual embodiment of the absence of ethical capitalists. And yet, just like in real life, we can’t get enough. <br><br></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It had courted Ford as a potential investor, but Jia Yueting, the founder of rival EV startup Faraday Future, had quietly amassed around a 30% stake and was essentially blocking new investors.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">David Stern, a mysterious businessman and close advisor to former Prince Andrew, saw an opportunity to break the logjam: bring in Jeffrey Epstein. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Ford will likely be lead in $400m Series D in Lucid. Big strategic move,” Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a> to Epstein in emails released last week as part of the Department of Justice’s latest disclosure of 3 million documents related to Epstein. Jia “has massive cash issues” at Faraday, he wrote, and needs to “sell now to make payroll for his other business.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It wasn’t the first EV startup Stern pitched Epstein, and it wouldn’t be the last, according to hundreds of documents reviewed by TechCrunch. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the time, legacy automakers and newly minted startups, fueled by the breakthrough success of Tesla and progress by Google’s self-driving project, were jumping into electric and autonomous vehicles. And Stern was apparently hungry to take advantage of the resulting deal flow. The documents show he also pitched investments in Faraday Future and in another EV startup, Canoo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s unlikely Epstein invested in any of them. Lucid didn’t close its Series D until late 2018, when it raised more than $1 billion from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. Faraday ultimately received a major investment from Chinese real estate conglomerate Evergrande in late 2017. Epstein said in a 2018 message included in the Justice Department’s files that he had no “direct” or “indirect” interest in Canoo.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These discussions instead provide greater insight into the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/05/business/epstein-investments-palantir-coinbase-thiel.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">many connections</a> Epstein, a convicted sex offender, had to Silicon Valley startups up until his arrest and death in 2019. They also provide a snapshot of a relationship that has not been explored in previous reporting.  </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By the time of the Lucid emails, Epstein and Stern had been working together closely for nearly a decade, the newly released documents show.  To Epstein, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01885249.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my china contact.” To Stern, Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00754450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">was</a> “my mentor, and I do what he tells me.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-ghost-of-a-businessman\">A ‘ghost’ of a businessman</h2>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090533\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg 1980w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1200,799 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1280,852 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=430,286 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=720,479 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=900,599 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=800,533 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=1536,1022 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=668,445 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=563,375 563w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=927,617 927w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=708,471 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/pitchpalace-Getty.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">Prince Andrew, Duke of York (left) at the opening of Pitch@Palace 6.0. David Stern is sitting next to Queen Elizabeth II.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>John Stillwell – WPA Pool / Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern is a mostly digital ghost with little information available about him on the internet prior to the release of the files. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He is perhaps best known as the director of Prince Andrew’s Pitch@Palace startup contest, which ran for a few years until Andrew’s connections to Epstein were exposed. Andrew even referred to Stern as a “ghost” in <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02423759.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">one 2010 email</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern appears to have first approached Epstein in 2008, according to the emails released by the DOJ — just one month before the financier pled guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution in Florida. Stern was creating a fund, called AGC Capital, to take advantage of the economic boom in China, and he wanted Epstein to invest. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear how Stern was introduced to Epstein. Stern did not respond to a detailed list of questions for this article.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern, who is German, attended the University of London and Shi-Da University in China in the late 1990s, and served as chairman of China Millennium Capital, the Chinese arm of Millennium Capital Partners, according to the bio section of the AGC Capital <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/AGC_Capital.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pitch deck</a>, which is in the DOJ’s files.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also worked for Siemens, negotiating “industrial Joint Ventures with Chinese State Owned enterprises,” before joining the Shanghai office of Deutsche Bank. He started a company called Asia Gateway in 2001 that “advised blue chip companies, Chinese enterprises as well as the Chinese government in growth strategies and investments.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These jobs appear to have helped Stern make connections with powerful and wealthy Chinese businessmen, including Li Botan — the son-in-law of the fourth-most senior leader in China under Xi Jinping’s predecessor Hu Jintao. (Li would eventually go on to become a founding investor in Canoo with Stern.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear if Epstein invested in AGC Capital; the financier spent the next year serving his sentence. But Stern and Epstein remained in touch, and in 2009 Stern started pitching other ideas. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The documents reveal a relationship that starts off formal and terse, with Epstein at one point <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02436755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">excoriating</a> Stern for not having properly prepared a potential business deal. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[I]f you want to do real deals you have to be precise and careful„ every error is a fortune,” Epstein wrote. “[Y]our first grade is an F.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?w=608\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090540\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png 608w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=150,135 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=300,269 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=430,386 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=418,375 418w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=591,531 591w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-06-at-1.43.07-PM.png?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-element-caption__text\">David Stern with Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and former Prince Andrew.</span><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Department of Justice (screenshot)</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the first big projects the two men collaborated on was helping the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/06/david-stern-prince-andrew-aide-epstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">her miserable finances,</a> according to the emails.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The relationship deepened over the following decade. The two men got close enough that Stern felt comfortable <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02476367.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">asking</a> Epstein in 2016 to become the godfather of one of his children. (Epstein wrote that he was “flattered” but declined because he “made a promise to my goddaughter that I would not be godfather to anyone else.”) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s hard to say how fruitful the relationship was on the business side. But between 2009 and 2019, Stern brought Epstein a number of potential deals across various industries. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Early on, he seemed dead set on starting a “secret” new <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01824161.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">fund</a> with Epstein to invest in Chinese businesses together, which he referred to as JEDS — the two men’s initials combined. (It was also referred to in some emails as “Serpentine Group.”) Stern later <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00720322.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pitched</a> buying farmland in Russia, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02644597.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> purchasing the news organization Al Jazeera and taking it public, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02429755.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">discussed</a> buying troubled music publisher EMI, and considered acquiring an apparently distressed (and unnamed) <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00956807.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">undersea cable company</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">They also had their eyes on banks. Stern and Epstein attempted to buy Luxembourg-headquartered private bank Sal. Oppenheim, <a href=\"https://www.luxtimes.lu/businessandfinance/jeffrey-epstein-attempted-to-buy-bank-in-luxembourg-in-2009-files-show/129918820.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">the emails show</a>.

In February 2012, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA02018022.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">suggested</a> Epstein introduce Jes Staley — the head of J.P. Morgan’s investment bank at the time — to Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I know Anwar well,” Stern wrote. “If he becomes prime minister of malayisa [Staley] will clean up and it could be a gold mine for JPM.” (Ibrahim lost a contested election in 2013 but became prime minister in 2022.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Stern also claimed to have had <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02510185.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">dinner with Jack Ma</a>, had a planned meeting “<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02598153.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">alone</a>” with UAE president Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, and said he was “<a href=\"https://assets.getkino.com/documents/EFTA02688656.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">friends</a>” with the grandson of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-going-electric\">Going electric</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">By 2017, Stern was apparently eyeing the rush to build new mobility companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He tried to get Epstein to meet Faraday Future founder Jia to discuss an investment. It’s not clear if that ever happened; the company and Jia did not respond to requests for comment. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But former BMW and Deutsche Bank CFO Stefan Krause, who had been brought in to save Faraday Future, made a direct appeal to Epstein in April 2017.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Faraday Future (FF) is a great story in itself, regretfully surrounded by a lot of noise around Jia Yueting (YT) and his other enterprises (LeEco, LeMall, LeSports, to name a few). These businesses are not working, so he run out of cash. FF is starving,” Krause <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01048952.pdf\">wrote</a> to Epstein. “Great chance to build a better Tesla.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">(Krause is described as a “friend” and a business partner of Stern’s in the documents. He didn’t respond to a request for comment.) </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It appears those conversations petered out. Soon after, Stern suggested the Lucid Motors investment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In May 2017, a pitch deck landed in Epstein’s inbox. It was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">put together by a fund called Monstera</a> that Stern had <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00696433.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">created</a>. “Monstera can gain a 32% shareholding in Lucid through the acquisition of the stake currently controlled by Yueting Jia,” one slide reads. Other emails show that Stern expected to spend around $300 million to <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02650036.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">acquire the 32% stake</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02649486.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">referred</a> to it as a “fire sale” in emails. Monstera could either hold the position or “[o]ffload” it “when Ford comes in.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Ford ultimately <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">pulled out,</a> and Lucid had to wait to close its Series D until August 2018, when Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund invested more than $1 billion. (SEC filings show the Saudi sovereign wealth fund repurchased Jia’s shares over the next few years. Lucid did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When Krause left Faraday Future to start a new EV company in late 2017 — first called Evelozcity and later, Canoo — Stern was one of the original backers. He contributed just $1 million alongside larger sums from Li, the CCP-connected Chinese businessman, and Michael Chiang, a billionaire who runs Taiwanese electronics giant TPK. (Li’s involvement later triggered a national security review when Canoo went public in 2020.) </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2018, Stern sent Epstein a document about the startup, to which Epstein responded: “fun.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But Epstein never invested in Canoo, either. He did, however, pitch powerful people on Stern’s behalf. Epstein <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01040351.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">emailed</a> Deepak Chopra in May 2018 and told the self-help guru that “david has a new electric car co in los angeles.” He told Chopra “they are going to build the next gen health sensors into the car. you guys should talk.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In June 2019, Epstein sent a message to Eduardo Teodorani, an Italian businessman who is a senior vice president of agriculture machinery giant CNH. “My friend David stern… has a electric car co that I think you should explore before he sells it to another co,” Epstein wrote. Epstein also <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01617958.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">connected</a> Stern with Sheikh Jabor al Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, on June 29 so he could “hear more about your car co.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One week after he sent that message, Epstein was arrested. He died in prison a month later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not clear when Stern last spoke to Epstein. But in March 2019, he forwarded a story to Epstein titled: “Warren Buffet: Electric Cars Are Very Much in America’s Future.” In the body of the email, Stern <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02632786.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">wrote</a>: “How do we get him ??”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Reddit CFO Andrew Vollero said the online forum site is looking for businesses that can either leverage Reddit’s scale — meaning their products become more impactful when deployed across Reddit’s massive user base — or help grow the company’s user base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“[We’re] looking to buy capabilities, technologies, and companies,” he said during the introductory remarks. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Investors, obviously, wanted to know more — particularly about what the company had in mind when it came to scaled opportunities.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the Q&amp;A portion of the call, Vollero clarified, “I probably wouldn’t overthink the scaled opportunities. I would just look at it as sort of a spectrum of opportunities.” He reiterated that the company was looking for capabilities and technologies that could add to its business, noting that it’s been successful doing this in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s really been one of the secrets of our success,” he pointed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Vollero explained that Reddit’s adtech team in particular had been adept at “tucking in” acquired technologies rather than building these things themselves.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Saves us six months to market, saves us twelve months to market, and you have a proven product,” the CFO remarked, crediting these deals with helping Reddit improve its monetization capabilities as an ad-supported business.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Still, Vollero cautioned that while adtech acquisitions have been what worked in the past, the company is “not ruling anything off the table.” That’s why he had mentioned that Reddit might buy companies that could deliver when added to a company of its size. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company in the quarter reported strong <a href=\"https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2026/Reddit-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Announces-1-Billion-Share-Repurchase-Program/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">earnings</a>, with $726 million in revenue, $690 million of which came from ads. Its global daily active unique users were up 19% year-over-year to 121.4 million, and its earnings per share of $1.24 beat estimates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit also said it sees a growing opportunity of generating revenue <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/reddit-looks-to-ai-search-as-its-next-big-opportunity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">from its AI search</a> product in the future, which raises the question as to whether the company is looking to this area for M&amp;A, too.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reddit, which has been ramping up its AI investments in recent months, including an AI search engine, has acquired startups before.

The verification is processed by a third-party vendor, <a href=\"https://withpersona.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Persona</a>, which deletes images and videos after completing the process, Roblox says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Once users complete an age check, they can access age-based chats, which means they can only communicate with others in a similar age group. There are six age groups: under 9, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20, and 21 plus. Users in each age group can chat with people in the groups directly above and below theirs. For example, users in the 9-12 category can chat with people in their own group, as well as those in the under 9 and 13-15 groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If the age-check process incorrectly estimates a user’s age, they can appeal the decision and verify their age through alternative methods, including ID verification or through parental controls that allow parents to update their child’s age.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said during its <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Q4 2025 earnings release</a> this week that age-checked data reveals a younger user base than self-reported data. This isn’t surprising, and even Roblox itself said it expected this outcome. Of the 45% of users who have undergone age checks, 35% are under 13, 38% are between the ages of 13 and 17, and 27% are over 18. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3080463\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png 1920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=150,84 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=768,432 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1200,675 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1280,720 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=720,405 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=900,506 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=800,450 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1536,864 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=668,375 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=1097,617 1097w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=708,398 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/EN_Age-Check-Flow-1.png?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Roblox</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As the company rolled out the new process, some concerns were raised around particular loopholes. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-ai-powered-age-verification-is-a-complete-mess/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wired</a> reported that eBay had listings for age-verified Roblox accounts for minors as young as nine years old. Even though eBay has removed the listings, concerns remain that predators could access accounts posing as minors by tricking the system.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox’s senior director of product policy, Eliza Jacobs, told TechCrunch on Friday that the company has continuous age-check systems running in the background to address these concerns and prevent this type of abuse.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Jacobs said the platform looks to see if “there are any signals on your account that indicate that the age that we now have on that account is not consistent with the activity on that account. Whether that’s the kinds of games you’re playing, or who you’re talking to. We also have key stroke analysis. The way adults type is different from the way kids type. So [we have] lots of systems running in the background to ensure that the age is accurate to the person actually using the account. And if we have any reason to believe that it’s not accurate, we will introduce additional checks to make sure that we have it right.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">She noted that another way Roblox looks for age accuracy is by looking at how a person uses emojis. Older generations tend to use emojis at the end of sentences as punctuation, while younger people often place them in the middle of sentences, Jacobs explained. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition to using age checks to make its platform safer, Roblox CEO and co-founder David Baszucki said during the company’s earnings call that the data collected as a result of these checks will be used to grow revenue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have been able to find a bigger growth opportunity in the 18-plus demographic than previously assumed,” Baszucki said. “We estimate our 18 and over cohort is growing at over 50%, and this cohort monetizes 40% higher than younger cohorts.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">He went on to say that Roblox is optimizing its platform to facilitate the growth of high-revenue genres popular with older users, such as shooters, RPGs, sports, and racing. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Roblox says it will continue to enhance its safety measures to respond to evolving risks and user needs.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Ron Wyden, the longest serving member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, does not disclose the nature of the CIA’s activities or the senator’s specific concerns. But the letter follows a pattern in recent years in which Wyden has publicly hinted at wrongdoing or illegality within the federal government, sometimes referred to as the “Wyden siren.” </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a statement (via the <a href=\"https://x.com/dnvolz/status/2019506714333310991\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Wall Street Journal’s Dustin Volz</a>), the CIA said it was “ironic but unsurprising that Senator Wyden is unhappy,” calling it a “badge of honor.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When reached by TechCrunch, a spokesperson for Wyden’s staff was unable to comment, as the matter was classified. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Tasked with oversight of the intelligence community, Wyden is one of a few lawmakers who is allowed to read highly classified information about ongoing government surveillance, including cyber and other intelligence operations. But as the programs are highly secretive, Wyden is barred from sharing details of what he knows with anyone else, including most other lawmakers, except for a handful of Senate staff with security clearance.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As such, Wyden, a known privacy hawk, has become one of the few key members of Congress whose rare but outspoken words on intelligence and surveillance matters are closely watched by civil liberties groups.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Over the past few years, Wyden has subtly sounded the alarm on several occasions in which he has construed a secret ruling or intelligence gathering method as unlawful or unconstitutional.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In 2011, Wyden said that the U.S. government was <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/05/secret-patriot-act/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">relying on a secret interpretation</a> of the Patriot Act, which he said — without disclosing the nature of his concerns — created a “gap between what the public thinks the law says and what the American government secretly thinks the law says.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Two years later, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/05/report-nsa-secretly-collecting-phone-records-of-all-verizon-calls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">revealed</a> that the National Security Agency was relying on its secret interpretation of the Patriot Act to force U.S. phone companies, including Verizon, to turn over the call records of hundreds of millions of Americans on an ongoing basis.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Since then, Wyden has sounded the alarm on how the U.S. government <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2017/06/15/wyden-siren-coats-is-answering-different-question-about-surveillance-us-persons/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">collects the contents of people’s communications</a>; revealed that the Justice Department barred Apple and Google from disclosing that federal authorities had been secretly <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/us-senator-warns-governments-spying-apple-google-smartphone-users-via-push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">demanding the contents of their customers’ push notifications</a>; and said that <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-calls-for-release-of-unclassified-report-on-national-security-threats-to-us-phone-system\">an unclassified report</a> that CISA has refused to release contains “shocking details” about national security threats facing U.S. phone companies.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As noted by <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2026/02/05/the-wyden-siren-senators-cryptic-cia-letter-follows-a-pattern-thats-never-been-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Techdirt’s Mike Masnick</a>, we may not know yet why Wyden sounded the siren about the CIA’s activities, but every time Wyden has warned, he has also been vindicated.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

But high-end e-ink readers with pens aren’t going to deliver Amazon a large audience. Meanwhile, nearly everyone can potentially justify the cost of an iPad because of its numerous capabilities, including streaming video, drawing, writing, using productivity tools, and the thousands of supported native apps and games.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Scribe Colorsoft, meanwhile, is designed to cater to a very specific type of e-book reader or worker. This type of device could be a good fit for students and researchers, as well as anyone else who regularly needs to mark up files or documents.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Someone particularly interested in making to-do lists or keeping a personal journal might also appreciate the device, but it would have to get daily use to justify this price.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090128\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg 2362w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=150,85 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=300,169 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=768,433 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=680,383 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1200,677 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1280,722 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=430,242 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=720,406 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=900,508 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=800,451 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1536,866 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1155 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=668,377 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=665,375 665w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=1094,617 1094w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=708,399 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-3.58.51-PM.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device is easy enough to use, with a Home screen design similar to other Kindles, offering quick access to your notes and library, and even suggestions of books you can write in, like Sudoku or crossword puzzle books or drawing guides. Your Library titles and book recommendations pop in color, which makes it easier to find a book with a quick scan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Spec-wise, Amazon says this newer 2025 model is 40% faster when turning pages or writing. We did find the tablet responsive here, as page turns felt snappy and writing flowed easily.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Despite its larger size, the device is thin and light, at 5.4 mm (0.21 inches) and 400 g (0.88 pounds), so it won’t weigh down your bag the way an iPad or other tablet would (the iPad mini, with an 8.3-inch screen, weighs slightly less). You could easily stand to carry the Kindle Scribe in your purse or tote, assuming you sport a bag that can fit an 11-inch screen. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/30/kindle-colorsoft-review-a-subtle-approach-to-color/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Compared with the original Colorsoft,</a> we like that the Scribe Colorsoft’s bezel is the same size around the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Kindle Scribe Colorsoft features a glare-free, oxide-based e-ink display with a textured surface that makes it feel a lot like writing on paper. This helps with the transition to a digital device for those used to writing notes by hand. It also saves on battery life — the device can go up to 8 weeks between charges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Helpfully, the display automatically adapts its brightness to your current lighting conditions, and you can opt to adjust the screen for more warmth when reading at night. But although it is a touchscreen, it’s less responsive than an LCD or OLED touchscreen, like those on iPad devices. That means when you perform a gesture, like pinching to resize the font, there’s a bit of a lag.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090129\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg 1464w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=150,150 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=300,300 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=680,680 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=1200,1200 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=1280,1280 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=430,430 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=720,720 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=900,900 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=800,800 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=668,668 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=375,375 375w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=617,617 617w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=531,531 531w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/YmRiMGI1ZTAt._CB776645745_.jpg?resize=50,50 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Like any Kindle, you can read e-books or PDFs on the Kindle Scribe Colorsoft tablet.

Your Notebooks on the device can be exported to Microsoft OneNote, as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The included pen comes with some trade-offs. Unlike the Apple Pencil, the Kindle’s Premium Pen doesn’t require charging, which is a perk. It has also been designed to mimic the feel of writing on paper, and it glides fairly well across the screen. Without a flat side to charge, the rounded pen doesn’t have the same feel and grip as the Apple Pencil. It’s smoother, so it could slip in your hand.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Amazon’s design also requires you to replace the pen tips from time to time, depending on your use, as they can wear down. It’s not terribly expensive to do so — <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Y69PCDQ?th=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">a 10 pack</a> is around $17 — but it’s another thing to keep up with and manage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are 10 different pen colors and five highlight colors included, so your notes and annotations can be fairly colorful. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090134\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg 5216w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=150,120 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=300,241 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=768,617 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=680,546 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1200,963 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1280,1028 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=430,345 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=720,578 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=900,723 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=800,642 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=1536,1233 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=2048,1644 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=668,536 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=467,375 467w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=661,531 661w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0909.jpeg?resize=50,40 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When writing, you can choose between a pen, a fountain pen, a marker, or a pencil with different stroke widths, depending on your preferences. You can set your favorite pen tool as a shortcut, which is enabled with a press and hold on the pen’s side button. (By default, it’s set to highlight.) If you grip your pen tightly and accidentally trigger this button, you’ll be glad to know you can shut this feature off.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The writing experience itself feels natural. And while the e-ink display means the colors are somewhat muted, which not everyone likes, it works well enough for its purpose. An e-ink tablet isn’t really the best for making digital art, despite its pens and new shader tool, but it is good for writing, taking notes, and highlighting.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">From the Kindle’s Home screen, you can either jump directly into writing something down through the Quick Notes feature, or you can get more organized by creating a Notebook from the Workspace tab. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090139\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg 2452w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=150,76 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=300,151 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=768,387 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=680,343 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1200,605 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1280,645 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=430,217 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=720,363 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=900,454 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=800,403 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1536,774 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1032 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=668,337 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=1224,617 1224w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=708,357 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Screenshot-2026-02-05-at-4.04.44-PM.jpg?resize=50,25 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Notebook offers a wide variety of notepad templates, allowing you to choose between blank, narrow, medium, or wide-ruled documents. There are templates for meeting notes, storyboards, habit trackers, monthly planners, music sheets, graph paper, checklists, daily planners, dotted sheets, and much more. (New templates with this device include Meeting Notes, Cornell Notes, Legal Pad, and College Rule options.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s fun that you can erase things just by flipping the pen over to use the soft-tipped eraser, as you would with a No. 2 pencil. Of course, a precision erasing tool is available from the toolbar with different widths, if needed. Thanks to the e-ink screen, you can sometimes still see a faint ghost of your drawing or writing on the screen after erasing, but this fades after a bit (which may drive the more particular types crazy).</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There’s a Lasso tool to circle things and move them around, copy or paste, or resize, but this probably won’t be used as much by more casual notetakers. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There are some other handy features for those who do a lot of annotating, too. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, when you’re writing in a Word document or book, a feature called Active Canvas creates space for your notes. As you write directly in the book on top of the text, the sentence will move and wrap around your note. Even if you adjust the font size of what you’re reading, the note stays anchored to the text it originally referenced. I prefer this to writing directly in e-books, as things stay more organized, but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/kindlescribe/comments/1hfvtl0/active_canvas_not_as_hoped/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">others</a> disagree.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090137\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg 920w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=150,136 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=300,272 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768,695 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=680,616 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=430,389 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=720,652 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=900,815 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=800,724 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=668,605 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=414,375 414w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=681,617 681w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=586,531 586w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/716a305B2vL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=50,45 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>Amazon</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In documents where margins expand, you can tap the expandable margin icon at the top of the left or right margin to take your notes in the margin, instead of on the page itself. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-kindle-with-ai-of-course\">A Kindle with AI (of course)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new Kindle also includes a number of AI tools and features. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The device will neaten up your scribbles and automatically straighten your highlighting and underlining. A couple of times, the highlighting action caused our review unit to freeze, but it recovered after returning to the Home screen with a press of the side button.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, a new AI feature (look for the sparkle icon at the top left of the screen) lets you both summarize text and refine your handwriting. The latter, oddly, doesn’t let you switch to a typed font but will let you pick between a small handful of handwritten fonts (Cadia, Florio, Sunroom, and Notewright) via the Customize button.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090133\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg 3024w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=150,127 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=300,254 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=768,650 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=680,575 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=1200,1015 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=1280,1083 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=430,364 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=720,609 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=900,762 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=800,677 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=1536,1300 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=2048,1733 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=668,565 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=443,375 443w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=729,617 729w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=627,531 627w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0910.jpeg?resize=50,42 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI tool was not perfect. It could decipher some terrible scrawls, but it did get stumped when there was another scribble on the page alongside the text. Still, it’s a nice option to have if you can’t write well after years of typing, but like the feel of handwriting things and the more analog vibe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI search feature can also look across your notebooks to find notes or make connections between them. To search, you either tap the on-screen keyboard or toggle the option to handwrite your search query, which is converted to text. You can interact with the search results (the AI-powered insights) by way of the Ask Notebooks AI feature, which lets you query against your notes.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?w=680\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3090132\" srcset=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg 4032w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=150,113 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=300,225 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=768,576 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=680,510 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=1200,900 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=1280,960 1280w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=430,323 430w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=720,540 720w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=900,675 900w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=800,600 800w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=668,501 668w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=500,375 500w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=823,617 823w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=708,531 708w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/IMG_0911.jpeg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><span class=\"wp-block-image__credits\"><strong>Image Credits:</strong>TechCrunch</span></figcaption></figure>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Soon, Amazon will add other AI <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/kindle-scribe-new-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">features</a>, too, including an “Ask This Book” feature that lets you highlight a passage and then get spoiler-free answers to a question you have — like a character’s motive, scene significance, or other plot detail.

Similarly, parental controls may not be effective because they require additional time and skills from parents to introduce the controls,” the Commission wrote.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The allegations against TikTok come as social media platforms deal with heightened scrutiny around the world, with some governments pushing to ban young users from accessing social media altogether. In November, Australia <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/28/australia-approves-law-banning-social-media-for-users-under-16/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mandated</a> social media sites to deactivate accounts belonging to users under 16, and the U.K. and Spain are reportedly looking into similar measures. France, Denmark, Italy, and Norway have worked on similar <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_age_verification_laws_by_country\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">age-restriction measures</a> for social media platforms, and in the United States, 24 states have so far enacted <a href=\"https://action.freespeechcoalition.com/age-verification-resources/state-avs-laws/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">age-verification</a> laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TikTok recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/27/technology/tiktok-settlement-social-media-addiction-lawsuit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">settled</a> a major social media addiction lawsuit in the U.S., and it now has time to reply to the European Commission’s preliminary findings. Confirmed breaches of the DSA can face a range of major sanctions, including fines of up to 6% of global annual turnover.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>This story was updated to add TikTok’s response.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

According to executives from Insilico Medicine and GenEditBio, the missing ingredient for years has been finding enough smart people to continue the work. AI, they say, is becoming the force multiplier that lets scientists take on problems the industry has long left untouched. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Speaking this week at Web Summit Qatar, Insilico’s president, Alex Aliper, laid out his company’s aim to develop “pharmaceutical superintelligence.” Insilico recently launched its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/22/insilico-medicine-ai-mma-science-gym/\">“MMAI Gym</a>” that aims to train generalist large language models, like ChatGPT and Gemini, to perform as well as specialist models.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The goal is to build a multimodal, multitask model that, Aliper says, can solve many different drug discovery tasks simultaneously with superhuman accuracy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We really need this technology to increase the productivity of our pharmaceutical industry and tackle the shortage of labor and talent in that space, because there are still thousands of diseases without a cure, without any treatment options, and there are thousands of rare disorders which are neglected,” Aliper said in an interview with TechCrunch. “So we need more intelligent systems to tackle that problem.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Insilico’s platform ingests biological, chemical, and clinical data to generate hypotheses about disease targets and candidate molecules. By automating steps that once required legions of chemists and biologists, Insilico says it can sift through vast design spaces, nominate high-quality therapeutic candidates, and even repurpose existing drugs — all at dramatically reduced cost and time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For example, the company recently used its AI models to identify whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat ALS, a rare neurological disorder. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">But the labor bottleneck doesn’t end at drug discovery. Even when AI can identify promising targets or therapies, many diseases require interventions at a more fundamental biological level. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 23, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio is part of the “second wave” of CRISPR gene editing, in which the process moves away from editing cells outside of the body (ex vivo) and toward precise delivery inside the body (in vivo). The company’s goal is to make gene editing a one-and-done injection directly into the affected tissue. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We have developed a proprietary ePDV, or engineered protein delivery vehicle, and it’s a virus-like particle,” GenEditBio’s co-founder and CEO, Tian Zhu, told TechCrunch. “We learn from nature and use AI machine learning methods to mine natural resources and find which kinds of viruses have an affinity to certain types of tissues.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The “natural resources” Zhu is referring to is GenEditBio’s massive library of thousands of unique, nonviral, nonlipid polymer nanoparticles — essentially delivery vehicles designed to safely transport gene-editing tools into specific cells.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says its NanoGalaxy platform uses AI to analyze data and identify how chemical structures correlate with specific tissue targets (like the eye, liver, or nervous system). The AI then predicts which tweaks to a delivery vehicle’s chemistry will help it carry a payload without triggering an immune response. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio tests its ePDVs in vivo in wet labs, and the results are fed back into the AI to refine its predictive accuracy for the next round. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Efficient, tissue-specific delivery is a prerequisite for in vivo gene editing, says Zhu. She argues that her company’s approach reduces the cost of goods and standardizes a process that has historically been difficult to scale. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It’s like getting an off-the-shelf drug [that works] for multiple patients, which makes the drugs more affordable and accessible to patients globally,” Zhu said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Her company recently <a href=\"https://www.ddw-online.com/geneditbio-gets-green-light-for-in-vivo-genome-editing-programme-39752-202601/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">received FDA approval</a> to begin trials of CRISPR therapy for corneal dystrophy.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-combating-the-persistent-data-problem\">Combating the persistent data problem</h2>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As with many AI-driven systems, progress in biotech ultimately runs up against a data problem. Modeling the edge cases of human biology requires far more high-quality data than researchers currently can get. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We still need more ground truth data coming from patients,” Aliper said. “The corpus of data is heavily biased over the Western world, where it is generated. I think we need to have more efforts locally, to have a more balanced set of original data, or ground truth data, so that our models will also be more capable of dealing with it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Aliper said Insilico’s automated labs generate multi-layer biological data from disease samples at scale, without human intervention, which it then feeds into its AI-driven discovery platform. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Zhu says the data AI needs already exists in the human body, shaped by thousands of years of evolution. Only a small fraction of DNA directly “codes” for proteins, while the rest acts more like an instruction manual for how genes behave. That information has historically been difficult for humans to interpret but is increasingly accessible to AI models, including recent efforts like Google DeepMind’s AlphaGenome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">GenEditBio applies a similar approach in the lab, testing thousands of delivery nanoparticles in parallel rather than one at a time. The resulting datasets, which Zhu calls “gold for AI systems,” are used to train its models and, increasingly, to support collaborations with outside partners. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">One of the next big efforts, according to Aliper, will be building digital twins of humans to run virtual clinical trials, a process that he says is “still in nascence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We’re in a plateau of around 50 drugs <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-025-00001-5#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approved%2050%20new,NASH%20medicine%20and%20much%20more.&amp;text=You%20have%20full%20access%20to%20this%20article%20via%20your%20institution.&amp;text=The%20FDA's%20Center%20for%20Drug,Source:%20FDA.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">approved by the FDA</a> every year annually, and we need to see growth,” Aliper said. “There is a rise in chronic disorders because we are aging as a global population … My hope is in 10 to 20 years, we will have more therapeutic options for the personalized treatment of patients.”</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
