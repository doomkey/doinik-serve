As part of the changes, Apple will block the downloads of apps rated 18+ in Brazil, Australia, and Singapore, while also rolling out other features to comply with laws in the U.S. states of Utah and Louisiana.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=f5zj08ey\">informed developers</a> on Tuesday that it’s expanding its set of “age assurance” tools, including an updated Declared Age Range API now available for beta testing. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">These <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/apple-introduces-new-child-safety-initiatives-including-an-age-checking-system-for-apps/\">tools allow developers to obtain a user’s age range</a> without gaining access to the user’s personal information, like their date of birth. The need for a technical solution like this came about as more governments around the world have created laws to block or restrict certain apps like social media that can only be used by adults 18 and up.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In Brazil, for example, developers can use the Declared Age Range API to obtain the user’s age category, if the user or their parent or guardian chooses to share it. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In addition, Apple will block users in Australia, Brazil, and Singapore from downloading apps rated 18+, starting today, until they confirm they are adults. In this case, the App Store will perform the age confirmation automatically, but Apple notes that developers may still have separate compliance requirements they need to meet.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Also, developers whose games contain loot boxes, a gambling-like mechanism that lets players spend money for a random chance at in-game rewards, and that lawmakers believe shouldn’t be available to kids, will see their apps’ age ratings updated to reflect an 18+ audience in Brazil, specifically.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In the U.S., new users in Utah and Louisiana will soon have their age categories shared with their developers’ apps through the Declared Age Range API, as well. The company said it has expanded its other tools around age ratings and permissions to meet its compliance obligations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“New signals are now available through the Declared Age Range API, including whether age-related regulatory requirements apply to the user and if the user is required to share their age range,” reads the Apple blog post. “The API will also let you know if you need to get a parent or guardian’s permission for significant app updates for a child.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Apple last October worked to comply with similar age assurance requirements in Texas, but <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/24/apple-pauses-app-store-changes-in-texas-after-court-blocks-age-assurance-law/\">put some of its plans on hold back in December,</a> as the state’s law is being fought in court. It also <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ks775ehf\">updated its age ratings system last year</a> with more granular age ranges than before, and added a variety of new questions for developers submitting apps to Apple for review.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Both will feed Form’s battery, which will be capable of delivering its rated power for 100 hours. At 30 gigawatt-hours, it will be the largest battery in the world, helping the data center operate on clean energy for longer periods of time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Such long-duration batteries help renewable energy sources continue to provide power at night or during lulls, “firming” the power source, as experts call it. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/05/energy-storage-industry-set-aggressive-goals-for-2025-and-already-crushed-them/\">Grid-scale lithium-ion batteries</a> do this already, though for shorter periods.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/06/form-energys-iron-air-battery-on-pace-for-2024-launch-with-450m-series-e/\">Form Energy’s batteries</a> are unlike most other grid-scale batteries. Whereas a typical grid-scale battery today uses lithium-ion technology that’s been repurposed from chemistries used by the automotive industry, Form’s batteries store energy by rusting and deoxidizing iron. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When oxygen from the air flows over pebbles of iron inside the battery, it rusts the iron, generating electricity in the process. To charge, electrical current deoxidizes the rust, turning it back into metallic iron and releasing oxygen in the process, which is drawn out of the battery.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">As battery chemistries go, Form’s iron-air cells are heavy and not very efficient. Typical iron-air batteries can only deliver 50% to 70% of the energy used to charge them, compared with upwards of 90% for lithium-ion batteries. But for all their downsides, they come with one very large upside: they’re incredibly cheap. Form says 1 kilowatt-hour of storage will ultimately cost just $20 using their technology, which is at least three times cheaper than lithium-ion batteries.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The new project also introduces a wonky utility fee structure to Minnesota that’s intended to help utilities adopt clean technologies without running afoul of their regulators, which push utilities to use the cheapest source of electricity. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Google first developed the concept in Nevada, where it’s buying power from enhanced geothermal startup Fervo. Alternately called the “clean transition tariff” or the “clean energy accelerator charge,” the agreement between Google and Xcel allows the utility to accept projects that might be considered risky by regulators, with the tech company paying a premium to ensure that regular ratepayers aren’t left holding the bag. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Solar and wind are both proven technologies, but Form’s iron-air batteries are still relatively new. The startup’s first battery is currently being installed in Minnesota with cooperative utility Great River Energy, and it will store 150 megawatt-hours for 100 hours, sending 1.5 megawatts to the grid at its peak. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Form makes its batteries at a factory in West Virginia. The company has raised $1.4 billion to date, according to PitchBook data.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It would also reflect an expansion of a broader pattern of executive branch instability that has intensified in recent years, according to Dean Ball, senior fellow at the Foundation for American Innovation and former senior policy advisor on AI in Trump’s White House. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“It would basically be the government saying, ‘If you disagree with us politically, we’re going to try to put you out of business,’” Ball said. </p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The dispute unfolds against a backdrop of ideological friction, with some in the administration — including AI czar David Sacks — publicly criticizing <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/21/anthropic-ceo-claps-back-after-trump-officials-accuse-firm-of-ai-fear-mongering/\">Anthropic’s safety policies as “woke.” </a></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Any reasonable, responsible investor or corporate manager is going to look at this and think the U.S. is no longer a stable place to do business,” Ball said. “This is attacking the very core of what makes America such an important hub of global commerce. We’ve always had a stable and predictable legal system.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s a serious game of chicken, and Anthropic may not be the one to blink first. According to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/anthropic-digs-heels-dispute-with-pentagon-source-says-2026-02-24/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=699e0924af1b980001cee0e0&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Reuters</a>, Anthropic doesn’t plan on easing its usage restrictions. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Anthropic is the only frontier AI lab with classified DOD access, according to several reports. The Department of Defense doesn’t have a backup option currently in play — though the Pentagon has <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/02/23/ai-defense-department-deal-musk-xai-grok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">reportedly</a> reached a deal to use xAI’s Grok in classified systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">That lack of redundancy may help explain the Pentagon’s aggressive posture, Ball argued. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If Anthropic canceled the contract tomorrow, it would be a serious problem for the DOD,” he told TechCrunch, noting the agency appears to be falling short of a <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/national-security-memorandum-advancing-the-united-states-leadership-artificial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">National Security Memorandum</a> from the late Biden administration that directs federal agencies to avoid dependence on a single classified-ready frontier AI system. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The DOD has no backups. This is a single-vendor situation here,” he continued. “They can’t fix that overnight.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">TechCrunch has reached out to Anthropic and the DOD for comment. </p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

These internal systems work by looking at signals like how long an account has existed, whether the user has a payment method on file, and what types of servers they’re in.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Let me be upfront: we knew this rollout was going to be controversial,” Discord CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy wrote in the <a href=\"https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a> announcing the change. “Any time you introduce something that touches identity and verification, people are going to have strong feelings. Rightfully so. In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord,” he continued. “That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord says that people who are part of the 10% of users who do need to verify their age will be given options to do so. Previously, Discord had stated that users could only verify their age by either completing a facial age estimation or submitting an ID to Discord’s vendor partners. Now Discord says that before expanding age verification worldwide, it plans to introduce additional verification methods, including the option to verify using a credit card.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“If you choose not to verify, here’s exactly what happens: you keep your account, your servers, your friends list, your DMs, and voice chat,” Vishnevskiy said in the post. “The only thing that changes is you won’t be able to access age-restricted content or change certain default safety settings designed to protect teens. Nothing else about your Discord experience changes.”</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also plans to publish information on its website about each verification vendor and their data practices, and clearly identify which vendor is being used. In addition, it now says it will only work with vendors that perform the age-verification process entirely on the user’s device.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The change around vendors also comes as Discord <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4g8ynpwl8o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">faced backlash</a> for listing Persona, which is backed by an investment firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, as one of its partners in age verification. Thiel is chairman and co-founder of Palantir, which has attracted controversy for its work with <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/department-homeland-security-ice-billion-dollar-agreement-palantir/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">U.S. immigration enforcement</a> and other <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/technology/trump-palantir-data-americans.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">federal surveillance programs</a>. Persona also attracted criticism from users for its use of third-party data and partnerships with governments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord is trying to distance itself from Persona and told <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/878369/discord-persona-age-verification\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Verge</a> yesterday that it “ran a limited test of Persona in the UK where age assurance had previously launched and that test has since concluded.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Discord also faced backlash for its age-verification plans because it had <a href=\"https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service?ref=404media.co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disclosed</a> last October that around 70,000 users may have had sensitive data, such as their government ID photos, exposed after hackers breached a third-party vendor that the platform used for age-related appeals.

In April 2024, Meta <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/11/meta-will-auto-blur-nudity-in-instagram-dms-in-latest-teen-safety-step/\">introduced</a> a feature that would automatically blur explicit images in Instagram DMs — something the company reportedly understood to be an issue nearly six years prior. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In a newly unsealed deposition in a federal lawsuit, Instagram head Adam Mosseri was asked about an August 2018 email chain with Meta VP and Chief Information Security Officer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/guyro/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Guy Rosen</a>, where he mentioned that “horrible” things could happen via Instagram private messages, also known as DMs. Those horrible things could include dick pics, the plaintiff’s lawyer said, and Mosseri agreed.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">However, the Meta exec pushed back at the line of questioning that suggested the company should have informed parents that its messaging system wasn’t monitored, beyond removing CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material).  </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“I think that it’s pretty clear that you can message problematic content in any messaging app, whether it’s Instagram or otherwise,” Mosseri said. He said the company tried to balance people’s interest in privacy with its own interests in safety.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The testimony also revealed new stats about harmful activity on Instagram, revealing that 19.2% of survey respondents ages 13 to 15 said they had seen nudity or sexual images on Instagram that they didn’t want to see. In addition, 8.4% of 13- to 15-year-olds said they had seen someone harm themselves or threaten to do so on Instagram over the past seven days they used the app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">While a nudity filter is only one of several updates that have been added to Instagram in recent years to protect teens, prosecutors were more interested in its delay to act, rather than whether the app is safer for teens now.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mosseri was also questioned on other topics, like an email from a Facebook intern in 2017, who said that he wanted to find “addicted” Facebook users and figure out if there were ways to help them.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The 2018 email chain was meant to serve as one example that Meta was aware of the risks to minors, but it took the company until 2024 to release a product that addressed the problem of sexual images sent to teens. This includes those images sent by adults who may have engaged in grooming, a process in which an adult builds trust with a minor over time to manipulate or sexually exploit them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Reached for comment, Meta spokesperson Liza Crenshaw pointed to the other ways the company has worked to keep teens safe over the years, noting that, “for over a decade, we’ve listened to parents, worked with experts and law enforcement, and conducted in-depth research to understand the issues that matter most. We use these insights to make meaningful changes—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with tools to manage their teens’ experiences. We’re proud of the progress we’ve made, and we’re always working to do better,” she said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The deposition provided by Mosseri took place during one of what are now <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/18/nx-s1-5716229/zuckerberg-social-media-addiction-trial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">several lawsuits</a> looking to hold big tech accountable for harming teens.

The defendants include Meta, Snap, TikTok, and YouTube (Google).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similar lawsuits are also underway <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/17/metas-own-research-found-parental-supervision-doesnt-really-help-curb-teens-compulsive-social-media-use/\">in the Los Angeles County Superior Court</a> and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/meta-new-mexico-child-exploitation-trial-19195fc680dba782fb971d68082e11a4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">in New Mexico</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Lawyers across the cases are hoping to prove that the big tech companies prioritized the need for user growth and increased engagement over the potential harms impacting their youngest users.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The timing of these trials comes amid a growing number of laws restricting social media teen use, both in several U.S. states and abroad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Updated after publication with Meta’s comment.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors want to back companies where the rate at which customers cancel or stop paying is low, meaning customers are happy. They want that annual or monthly recurring revenue to stick around and grow, not wobble and crash.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Even so, the phenomenon is real. As part of Stripe’s annual report, <a href=\"https://stripe.com/newsroom/news/stripe-2025-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">released</a> on Tuesday, the payments giant revealed that it had more new businesses start using its products in 2025 than ever before, with more than half — specifically 57% — outside the United States. This 2025 cohort grew 50% faster than those who started using Stripe products in 2024, it said. While Stripe did not reveal the hard numbers, it did say that 2025 saw double the number of these fledging startups hit $10 million in ARR within three months compared to the number that did so in 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The letter also noted that Stripe Atlas —  the company’s business incorporation tool  — saw a 41% increase in company formations last year. Of those new startups, 20% charged their first customer within 30 days, up from just 8% in 2020, further underscoring how quickly this new generation of founders is moving.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In comparison, in 2024, founders were still <a href=\"https://x.com/kennandavison/status/1800590629459665113\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">publicly celebrating</a> hitting $10 million in ARR in three years — which is still, by most business standards, a metric worth boasting about.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">So for all of those on social media <a href=\"https://x.com/RetentionAdam/status/2006740753687490857\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">saying things like</a>, “Bootstrapping to $10M ARR is easier and less risky than creating a VC-backed unicorn, ” or <a href=\"https://x.com/erniefromwallst/status/2024302945408557462\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">things like</a>, “the AI-native startups hitting $10M ARR with just three people are rewriting the entire playbook,” well, now there’s a smattering of data to back that up.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company made headlines in 2023 when <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/russian-zero-day-seller-offers-20m-for-hacking-android-and-iphones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it announced that it was offering</a> up to $20 million for zero-days in Android devices and iPhones, and later announced that <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/21/russian-zero-day-seller-is-offering-up-to-4-million-for-telegram-exploits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">it was offering up to $4 million</a> for zero-days in Telegram. The company <a href=\"https://opzero.ru/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">claims</a> to work exclusively with the Russian government and local organizations.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Operation Zero’s customers “could use the tools to launch ransomware attacks or engage in other malign activities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury said it’s also sanctioning the company’s founder, Sergey Zelenyuk, who officials accused of selling exploits to foreign intelligence agencies and who say he sought to develop spyware and hacking technologies. The Treasury said Zelenyuk engaged in recruiting hackers and developing relationships with foreign intelligence agencies through social media. (Operation Zero has accounts on both X and Telegram.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to the Treasury, Operation Zero acquired “at least eight proprietary cyber tools, which were created for the exclusive use of the U.S. government and select allies and which were stolen from a U.S. company,” and then “sold those stolen tools to at least one unauthorized user.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury said that the sanctions against Operation Zero and Zelenyuk coincide with an FBI investigation into Peter Williams, who worked for U.S. defense contractor L3Harris. In October, Williams <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/29/former-l3harris-trenchant-boss-pleads-guilty-to-selling-zero-day-exploits-to-russian-broker/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pleaded guilty to selling at least eight of the company’s exploits</a> to an unspecified Russian broker. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Treasury now says that the broker was Operation Zero, something that the government had not previously confirmed.</p>\n<p class=\"wp-block-shortcode\">\t\t</p><div class=\"article-block block--callout block--right has-green-500-background-color\">\n\t\t\t<h4 class=\"block--callout__title\">Contact Us</h4>\n\t\t\t<p>\nDo you have more information about Operation Zero?

The broker also offered high-paying bounties for hacking tools in popular software and hardware like Android devices, iPhones, Windows, and Chrome. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Operation Zero and Zelenyuk did not respond to a request for comment. Kucherov, Mamashoyev, and Vasanovich could not be immediately reached for comment. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">When contacted by TechCrunch, a person operating an Advance Security Solutions’ chat account claimed without evidence that Mamashoyev is not the founder of the company.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

The company said that a new agent being introduced in Opal will allow users to create mini-apps that can let them plan and execute tasks using text prompts.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The feature uses the Gemini 3 Flash model and automatically chooses tools to execute tasks.

Yes, you read that right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Eternal Playlist Urn is not really meant to hold ashes, but is instead a collector’s item, with only 150 available for purchase in the U.S. For $495, buyers receive a 7-inch-by-11.4-inch urn with a Bluetooth speaker built into the lid. (We question the audio quality, since all the tech is crammed into the lid of this tiny urn.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">According to Spotify, the urn offers “the world’s first ever music-streaming urn,” making death “a lot less boring.” With this product, the idea is that even the dearly departed can keep jamming to their favorite tunes for eternity, or at least that’s the company’s joke.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Life needs music.

Until now, a temporary suspension on Twitch meant losing access to the platform altogether, including the ability to chat, watch streams while logged in, and access basic information. Now, the company is implementing two suspension types: streaming suspensions and chatting suspensions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company notes that while its previous approach was easier to implement, its new targeted enforcement system means that the restrictions will match the specific offense committed. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">If a user violates Twitch’s Community Guidelines during a livestream, their account will be suspended from going live, and chat on their channel will be temporarily disabled. During a streaming suspension, the user can still watch streams while logged in, chat on other channels, and access their user dashboard. Plus, viewers will still be able to watch their existing clips and videos.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Similarly, if someone violates the company’s Community Guidelines in chat, they will receive a suspension from chat but will still be able to stream their own content or watch other streamers. Notably, users who receive a chat suspension can still chat in their own channel, but they will be prevented from participating in chats on other streams.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Higher severity violations present a greater risk to our community, therefore they will receive both chatting and streaming suspensions simultaneously to prevent further harm,” Twitch explained in a <a href=\"https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Modernizing-Our-Approach-to-Enforcements?language=en_US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">blog post</a>. “And, as is the case today, those who commit the most serious violations will receive an indefinite suspension and lose all access to Twitch. There is no place for serious violations on Twitch.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twitch isn’t changing the length of temporary suspensions, as streaming and chatting suspensions will last anywhere from 24 hours to 30 days.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company says that with each new violation, the length of the suspension will increase, and that accumulating multiple temporary suspensions can still lead to an indefinite suspension from Twitch.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Twitch determines the severity of a violation by considering the extent of harm it causes or has the potential to cause. It defines harm as any action that leads to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a user or to Twitch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company is working on additional suspension types that will roll out in future updates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Lightcap said that demand is strong, without sharing any numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We almost always find ourselves having to manage too much demand. We are still an organization that is growing, and so there is this global demand factor that we would love to be able to meet, and we are working as best as we can to be able to meet,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">At the same time, OpenAI is thinking about how to quantify success in the enterprise. Lightcap said that OpenAI will try to measure Frontier’s impact based on “business outcomes, not on seat licenses.” (The company hasn’t yet shared pricing for Frontier.)</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Frontier is a way for us to experiment iteratively with how to actually bring AI into the really messy and complex areas of businesses that I think if we get that right, we’re going to learn a lot about both businesses and also AI systems,” Lightcap noted.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Days after TechCrunch’s conversation, OpenAI partnered with consultancies like <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/23/openai-calls-in-the-consultants-for-its-enterprise-push/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Boston Consulting Group (BCG), McKinsey, Accenture, and Capgemini</a> to deploy its technology in an enterprise push. Even rival Anthropic launched plug-ins for finance, engineering, and design for enterprises to build agents based on Claude.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Meanwhile, the company doesn’t have a clear path of integrating recently acquired open source tool OpenClaw, but Lightcap said that it gives OpenAI “a glimpse into the future” where agents can do “almost anything you want them to be able to do on a computer.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In keeping with the India AI summit, OpenAI has made a number of recent announcements around its business in the world’s largest market. The company said India was the second biggest user base of ChatGPT outside the U.S., with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/15/india-has-100m-weekly-active-chatgpt-users-sam-altman-says/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more than 100 million weekly users</a>. Lightcap said that voice as a modality is picking up in India and enabling OpenAI to reach more people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Voice is so important here. And voice models now feel good enough and also good enough to run in low-latency and low-bandwidth environments, where you really can start to enable access to technology for a group of people who maybe were more disenfranchised than not,” Lightcap said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also signed an enterprise contract for the usage of its tools and to deploy compute. Lightcap noted India is fourth in terms of enterprise seats in Asia, which is low for a populous country, and OpenAI has a lot of scope to expand there.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The AI company is also set to open two new offices in India in Mumbai and Bengaluru. However, these are likely to be sales and go-to-market offices. When I asked Lightcap if these offices would include technical talent, he said, “Never say never.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">There is also a fear of job impact, especially in countries like India, where the IT services and BPO (business process outsourcing) industry is prominent, as AI tools automate some of the tasks. In the past few weeks, Indian IT company <a href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/stocks/nifty-it-index-crashes-nearly-3-as-anthropic-s-ai-claims-fuel-disruption-fears-tcs-infosys-among-top-losers-13840666.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">stocks have dipped</a> as the market is taking into account the fact that areas like coding might require fewer humans. Lightcap said that the company is being “grounded” in what it has observed in terms of jobs market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“Our view is that over time, jobs will change. I think we don’t yet know where, how, or what, but it seems inevitable that work will look different in the future than it looks today. And that’s natural, that’s part of the business cycle. It’s part of the global and dynamic economy that we live in. And so I think what we have to do is be able to obviously have empathy for where jobs are changing at a high rate,” he noted.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

Investors buying the shares include Thrive Capital, Coatue, Andreessen Horowitz, and Stripe itself.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">In February 2025, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/27/stripe-finalizes-tender-sale-at-a-91-5b-valuation-says-payment-volumes-grew-to-1-4t-in-2024/\">Stripe announced its previous tender offer</a>, which valued the company at $91.5 billion. So that’s about a 74% increase in valuation over the year. The annual announcement isn’t by chance. Stripe has timed this news with its annual letter from founders Patrick and John Collison that showcases its year of product releases, and some insights into global usage of its products for a year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">For instance, Stripe says that stablecoin payments’ volume doubled worldwide to around <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stablecoins-payments-what-raw-transaction-numbers-4qjke\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$400 billion</a> in 2025, 60% of which it estimates comes from B2B payments. That growth is one reason Stripe has invested heavily in crypto foundations recently, acquiring crypto wallet service Privy in July, and unveiling its own blockchain for payments, Tempo, in September. As for <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/05/stripe-makes-1-1-billion-crypto-bet-as-it-closes-on-bridge-acquisition/\">Bridge</a>, the stablecoin orchestration platform that Stripe acquired last year, it saw its volume more than quadruple, the company says.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><em>Correction: This story originally stated that the global stablecoin volume was on Stripe’s network and has now been corrected.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n</div></body></html>"

These options were previously only available to customers on its <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://youtube.com/premium\">full plan</a>, which costs $13.99 per month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company said the additions were the result of user feedback, as customers in its pilot program shared that they wanted these specific features to make the subscription more attractive. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/05/youtube-launches-a-7-99-per-month-ad-free-premium-lite-subscription/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Launched last March</a>, YouTube Premium Lite introduced a more modestly priced subscription tier that would remove ads from “most” videos on the platform, including those across popular verticals like gaming, fashion, beauty, cooking, news, and more. However, ads would continue to be shown on music content and music videos. Plus, customers on the Lite plan won’t have access to the ad-free YouTube Music app.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">With the arrival of these new features, ad-free music content will now be the only reason to upgrade to the full Premium subscription. It will also likely make the Lite tier more attractive to customers who didn’t want to pay just for ad-free content but wanted other upgrades as well.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The Lite subscription tier was first introduced in Thailand, Germany, and Australia, before <a href=\"https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-premium-lite/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">coming to the U.S.</a> last year.

Combined with ads, YouTube’s overall revenue reached $60 billion in 2025, according to information shared by parent company Alphabet earlier this month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/googles-subscriptions-rise-in-q4-as-youtube-pulls-60b-in-yearly-revenue/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">during Q4 earnings</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The company also reported that YouTube’s ad revenue increased 9% to $11.38 billion in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the “subscriptions, platforms and devices” group’s revenue increased 17% to $13.6 billion in Q4, which the company attributed to strong growth in YouTube subscriptions, particularly YouTube Music and YouTube Premium.</p>\n<div class=\"wp-block-techcrunch-inline-cta\">\n\t<div class=\"inline-cta__wrapper\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__flag\">Techcrunch event</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"inline-cta__content\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<p class=\"inline-cta__event-info\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__location\">Boston, MA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__separator\">|</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span class=\"inline-cta__date\">June 9, 2026</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Alphabet reported more than 125 million YouTube Music and YouTube Premium users worldwide in March 2025.

Hundreds of musicians, including stars like Billie Eilish, Katy Perry, and Jon Bon Jovi, signed an open letter in 2024 calling on tech companies not to undermine human creativity with AI music-generation tools.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A cohort of music publishers also recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/music-publishers-sue-anthropic-for-3b-over-flagrant-piracy-of-20000-works/\">sued</a> the AI company Anthropic for $3 billion, claiming that the company illegally downloaded more than 20,000 copyrighted songs, including sheet music, song lyrics, and musical compositions. (Anthropic was already ordered by the court to offer a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">$1.5 billion</a> settlement to authors whose books were pirated for AI training.)</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Other artists, however, have embraced the potential of this technology as a way to improve audio quality, rather than as a creative aid.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Paul McCartney used <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/the-beatles-won-a-grammy-last-night-thanks-to-ai/\">AI-powered noise reduction systems</a> — the kind of technology that allows Zoom or FaceTime to block out unwanted background noises on your video calls — to clean up a decades-old, low-quality John Lennon demo.

Telisha Jones, a 31-year-old in Mississippi, used Suno to turn her (supposedly organic) poetry into the viral R&amp;B song “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opuDZYJuAz0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">How Was I Supposed to Know</a>” and signed a record deal with Hallwood Media in a deal reportedly worth <a href=\"https://www.ebony.com/xania-monet-ai-artist-record-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">$3 million</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The law remains unclear on the legality of using copyrighted works as training data — one federal judge, William Alsup, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/05/screw-the-money-anthropics-1-5b-copyright-settlement-sucks-for-writers/\">ruled last year</a> that training on copyrighted data is legal, but pirating it is not. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\"></p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"

It claims the 2025 breach at SonicWall “exposed critical security information for Marquis and every customer that used SonicWall’s firewall cloud backup service.”</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis’ chief executive Satin Mirchandani told TechCrunch in a statement that SonicWall allegedly failed to secure its backup service, which caused the company to suffer “significant reputational, operational, and financial harm.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">News of the lawsuit comes weeks after TechCrunch reported that Marquis was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/fintech-firm-marquis-blames-hack-at-firewall-provider-sonicwall-for-its-data-breach/\">planning to seek compensation</a> from SonicWall. The Plano, Texas-based fintech giant had told its customers that it blamed SonicWall for allowing hackers to steal sensitive information about customer firewall configuration files, including its own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“SonicWall allowed a threat actor to obtain the keys to bypass that line of defense and walk right into Marquis’s internal network, the very thing that SonicWall’s firewall was supposed to prevent,” reads the complaint.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Firewalls are meant to prevent unauthorized access to a company’s network, but Marquis alleges that the hackers who scrambled its network with ransomware used information stolen from SonicWall about how its customers configure their firewalls, including emergency passcodes (known as scratch codes) that allowed access to Marquis’ internal network.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis, which allows hundreds of banks and credit unions to visualize their customers’ data, said the hackers took “personally identifiable information concerning customers of some of Marquis’s financial institution clients” in its cyberattack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The stolen data includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, and financial information, including bank account, debit, and credit card numbers, as well as customers’ Social Security numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">A spokesperson for SonicWall did not immediately comment on the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">SonicWall <a href=\"https://www.sonicwall.com/support/notices/mysonicwall-cloud-backup-file-incident/kA1VN0000000RoD0AU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">first admitted</a> a breach of its systems in mid-September, in which it said fewer than 5% of its customer firewall configuration backup files were exfiltrated from its storage servers, hosted on Amazon’s cloud and maintained by SonicWall. The firewall maker in October <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/sonicwall_breach_hits_every_cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">conceded that in fact every customer</a> had their firewall backup files stolen in the breach.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis in December 2025 <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">began notifying affected people</a> that its networks had been breached that August. SonicWall has not said when hackers were first able to gain access to its systems. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">It’s not yet clear what caused the breach at SonicWall. In its complaint, Marquis claims SonicWall made a code change to one of its APIs months earlier, in February 2025, that “created a vulnerability exploitable by threat actors.” Marquis said that this bug allowed the hackers to access customer firewall configuration backup files “without proper authentication” by guessing predictable firewall serial numbers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“While we were able to secure our network and client data quickly, our investigation revealed that our exposure to threat actors was due to SonicWall’s network breach and failure to notify us that our firewall protection was potentially compromised,” Mirchandani, said in a statement shared with TechCrunch.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Mirchandani told TechCrunch that SonicWall has not yet provided any non-public information about the root cause of its breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">“We hope to learn more through the litigation process,” Mirchandani said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">Marquis still will not say how many individuals are affected by its data breach. According to a listing with the Texas’ attorney general, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/03/fintech-firm-marquis-alerts-dozens-of-us-banks-and-credit-unions-of-a-data-breach-after-ransomware-attack/\">at least 400,000 people across the U.S.</a> are known to be affected by the fintech giant’s breach. </p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-block-paragraph\">The number of affected individuals is anticipated to rise as more data breach notifications are filed with various U.S. attorneys general.</p>\n</div>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t</div></body></html>"
